# Study on Rails: My Issue with Office Hours
## 
### Liam Kinney 
The question read: "Calculate a
numerical value for the angu
lar velocity of the right-hand
ed orthogonal unitary basis A in the
reference frame N for the situation
of a particle traveling in circular
motion at 12 meters per second."
I recognized a few words in the
statement from the El 5 lectures
and readings, but there was a
synaptic canyon in my head be
tween the raw information I had
and the answer to this question. I
had read the chapters and attended
the lectures with wide eyes and a
busy pencil, but a master of rapid
recall does not an engineer make.
As usual it was my inability to apply
the knowledge I had, rather than a
shortage of it, that brought me to
office hours.
Late into the night, each fending
off dinner-hunger with snacks, 50
people crammed into 40 chairs and
paid homage to the two answer
keys in the room and their five cau
tious mediators, the TAs. I sat down
and put each problem through the
usual three-step process:
1. Work through the problem by
myself until I get to that impossible
part g, which involves some idea
that the teacher hasn't covered yet
or perhaps a mastery of some hiero
glyphic programming language like
MATLAB or Motion Genesis.
2. Ask the people immediately
around me to see if the problem has
already been addressed en masse.
3. Enter into the five-to-fifteen
minute line for TA help. Usually, be
fore I get to the front of the line, one

of the TAs notices a trend, stands
up and announces "We're gonna go
over part g on this board over
here!" This arrests the attention of
every student in the room, since
there have been rumors about part
g floating around and this is the one
chance you'll get unless you want
to be phoning around for a walk
through from a classmate in the
wee hours of Tuesday morning.
The result of the three-step
process mentioned above, which I
think everyone follows consciously
or unconsciously, is a universal
plateau of progress. The students
who are on question 8 get roped in
to advising those on question 3,
which retards the progress of the
advanced students and accelerates
the progress of the sluggish ones.
Despite any amount of effort, the
entire class inevitably breaks
against a dam problem like part g
until the TAs open the floodgates.
With the strong students helping
the weak and the TAs waiting for
maximum question capacity to re
lease the answers, room-wide
progress eventually levels off.
At this point, the place sheds its
former designation as office hours
and becomes an elementary school
classroom. The TAs tiptoe through
each problem, averse to providing
any original information of their
own, but loose-lipped once someone
shouts anything that sounds re
motely similar to a step in the solu
tion " vectors!" "factor!" "bub
tract!" The students' homework
becomes a part of the 3-hour assem

bly line that is Engineering Depart
ment office hours.
At first glance, this doesn't seem
like too bad a deal, but look at who's
actually doing the work. Sure, it's
just three hours on a Monday night
for a juicy perfect score in a pesky
fundamentals class, but the only
thing you get out of it is the grade.
I've watched a freshman in
CME 100 hand her laptop to frus
trated TAs who write her code for
her, while she learns none of the
MATLAB she needs for her major.
I've seen students of Math 51 verge
on plagiarism by copying the an
swers off the one kid in their dorm
who did the best, covering their
tracks by altering their explana
tions harmlessly here and there.
I've listened to the crickets chirp in
response to a Bio core TA asking,
"So does everyone get how I did
that?"
Office hours are a crutch on
which too many lean, and which the
more advanced classes will knock
away. Their intent is to create an ac
cessible learning environment, but
their effect is a desperate copying
environment.
Yet this is not always the case;
office hours in the humanities often
manifest themselves as rapt conver
sations between a leader in the field
and a handful of zealous pupils. The
endemic is mostly sequestered to
the STEM office hours, where ex
hausted TAs are reduced to hand
ing out explanations instead of pa
tiently drawing them out of their
students.
The worst part is that, in these
high-stress, time-sensitive environ
ments where the "why" takes a
backseat, it is the TAs who freely
hand out answers who earn the pos
itive reputations. This counterpro
ductive behavior is being rewarded
in all the wrong ways. The more
students who flock to these 'good'
TAs, the more who will be eventual
ly dependent on them, office-hour
symbiotic in aeternum.
Perhaps this is not a problem
that can be solved structurally, but
the addiction can certainly be evad
ed individually. Office hours are a
fine environment in which to learn,
but one has to make sure that he or
she does learn. Though deadlines
may approach and your priorities
might begin to ache, hold the value
of knowledge above that of the
grade, and be careful that the work
you do in office hours is indeed
yours.

hand out answers who earn the pos

ductive behavior is being rewarded
in all the wrong ways. The more
students who flock to these 'good'
TAs, the more who will be eventual

Perhaps this is not a problem
that can be solved structurally, but
the addiction can certainly be evad
ed individually. Office hours are a
fine environment in which to learn,
but one has to make sure that he or
she does learn. Though deadlines
may approach and your priorities
might begin to ache, hold the value
of knowledge above that of the
grade, and be careful that the work
you do in office hours is indeed
yours.

The question read: "Calculate a
numerical value for the angu
lar velocity of the right-hand
ed orthogonal unitary basis A in the
reference frame N for the situation
of a particle traveling in circular
motion at 12 meters per second."
I recognized a few words in the
statement from the El 5 lectures
and readings, but there was a
synaptic canyon in my head be
tween the raw information I had
and the answer to this question. I
had read the chapters and attended
the lectures with wide eyes and a
busy pencil, but a master of rapid
recall does not an engineer make.
As usual it was my inability to apply
the knowledge I had, rather than a
shortage of it, that brought me to
office hours.
Late into the night, each fending
off dinner-hunger with snacks, 50
people crammed into 40 chairs and
paid homage to the two answer
keys in the room and their five cau
tious mediators, the TAs. I sat down
and put each problem through the
usual three-step process:
1. Work through the problem by
myself until I get to that impossible
part g, which involves some idea
that the teacher hasn't covered yet
or perhaps a mastery of some hiero
glyphic programming language like
MATLAB or Motion Genesis.
2. Ask the people immediately
around me to see if the problem has
already been addressed en masse.
3. Enter into the five-to-fifteen
minute line for TA help. Usually, be
fore I get to the front of the line, one

of the TAs notices a trend, stands
up and announces "We're gonna go
over part g on this board over
here!" This arrests the attention of
every student in the room, since
there have been rumors about part
g floating around and this is the one
chance you'll get unless you want
to be phoning around for a walk
through from a classmate in the
wee hours of Tuesday morning.
The result of the three-step
process mentioned above, which I
think everyone follows consciously
or unconsciously, is a universal
plateau of progress. The students
who are on question 8 get roped in
to advising those on question 3,
which retards the progress of the
advanced students and accelerates
the progress of the sluggish ones.
Despite any amount of effort, the
entire class inevitably breaks
against a dam problem like part g
until the TAs open the floodgates.
With the strong students helping
the weak and the TAs waiting for
maximum question capacity to re
lease the answers, room-wide
progress eventually levels off.
At this point, the place sheds its
former designation as office hours
and becomes an elementary school
classroom. The TAs tiptoe through
each problem, averse to providing
any original information of their
own, but loose-lipped once someone
shouts anything that sounds re
motely similar to a step in the solu
tion " vectors!" "factor!" "bub
tract!" The students' homework
becomes a part of the 3-hour assem

bly line that is Engineering Depart
ment office hours.
At first glance, this doesn't seem
like too bad a deal, but look at who's
actually doing the work. Sure, it's
just three hours on a Monday night
for a juicy perfect score in a pesky
fundamentals class, but the only
thing you get out of it is the grade.
I've watched a freshman in
CME 100 hand her laptop to frus
trated TAs who write her code for
her, while she learns none of the
MATLAB she needs for her major.
I've seen students of Math 51 verge
on plagiarism by copying the an
swers off the one kid in their dorm
who did the best, covering their
tracks by altering their explana
tions harmlessly here and there.
I've listened to the crickets chirp in
response to a Bio core TA asking,
"So does everyone get how I did
that?"
Office hours are a crutch on
which too many lean, and which the
more advanced classes will knock
away. Their intent is to create an ac
cessible learning environment, but
their effect is a desperate copying
environment.
Yet this is not always the case;
office hours in the humanities often
manifest themselves as rapt conver
sations between a leader in the field
and a handful of zealous pupils. The
endemic is mostly sequestered to
the STEM office hours, where ex
hausted TAs are reduced to hand
ing out explanations instead of pa
tiently drawing them out of their
students.
The worst part is that, in these
high-stress, time-sensitive environ
ments where the "why" takes a
backseat, it is the TAs who freely
hand out answers who earn the pos
itive reputations. This counterpro
ductive behavior is being rewarded
in all the wrong ways. The more
