## SUN DEVILS EXTINGUISHED POWELL'S 28 PROPEL CARD 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
With little room for error left on
the schedule following Stanford's
near-miss loss to Arizona on
Thursday, the Cardinal men's bas
ketball team's two best players
came up big when needed most, as
the Cardinal defeated the Arizona
State Sun Devils by a 76-70 score
on Saturday afternoon. After a
slow start to the game that saw
Stanford (14-7, 5-4 Pac-12) trail the
Sun Devils (16-6, 5-4) by as many
as six points, senior forward
Dwight Powell and junior guard
Chasson Randle dominated the
second half to help Stanford come
away with the victory.

Powell matched a season high
with 28 points on 8-of-19 shooting
in addition to a 10-of-12 effort from
the foul line. Randle added 21
points in the victory, with 15 com
ing in the second half.
Much like the game against Ari
zona, a 1-point game at the half
turned into a sizable Stanford lead
after a large Cardinal run opened
the second period. Stanford began
the half on a 23-9 run to open up a
13-point lead, 55-42, with 12:14 re
maining in the game. Powell and
Randle scored 21 of the team's 23
points during the stretch, and Pow
ell assisted on the only other Stan
ford basket during the run a
Josh Huestis dunk off of an in
bounds pass.
"We were pretty close at half,
and we knew we had to come out

the first four minutes and create
some separation, because they're
obviously a great team and we're
going to fight regardless of what
the score was," Powell said. "We
definitely came out with an aggres
sive mindset to start off the second
half."
Unlike the Arizona game, Stan
ford was able to hang on to its lead
this time around despite the best
efforts of Arizona State's back
court. Sophomore Jahii Carson,
who looks to be a lottery pick in
next year's NBA Draft, and senior
Jermaine Marshall, a prolific 3-
point shooter, combined for 46 of
Arizona State's 70 points, including
28 in the second half.
Despite picking up his fourth
foul with 10:48 remaining, Carson
returned to the game with about
eight minutes left and rallied the
Sun Devils. He scored seven points
over the final 5:29 of the game, in
cluding a big 3-pointer to draw
ASU within five with 3:15 remain
ing.
"[Carson's] a great player,"
Randle said. "He's so quick and
able to change directions at the
drop of a dime."
"That was definitely a big moti
vator for me," said Randle of Car
son's 34-point performance in last
year's Pac-12 Tournament game
between Stanford and ASU. "I def
initely didn't play as well as I want
ed to, so we definitely wanted to
come out tonight and get the win."
Stanford still held a 70-62 lead
with 1:18 remaining after senior
Stefan Nastic made one of two free
throws, but the Sun Devils, with
some assistance from the Cardinal,
did their best to make things inter
esting.
Carson came flying down the

court to score a layup just three
seconds later. On the inbounds,
Powell threw the ball off of senior
Anthony Brown's leg and out of
bounds, giving ASU possession
again with 1:12 remaining. Mar
shall hit a 3-pointer just three sec

onds after the turnover, and just
like that, ASU was back within a
possession with more than a
minute left to play.
This time around, however, the

Junior guard Chasson Randle (right) scored 15 of his 21 points in the
second half as the Cardinal was able to hold on to its lead and
bounce back from a tough loss to Arizona with a victory over ASU.
Cardinal did not let the op
portunity slip out of its
hands, as Powell was fouled
on Stanford's next posses
sion after a strong drive to
the hoop. After Powell made
one free throw, the Cardinal
played good defense on the
ensuing possession, forcing
a tough 3-point attempt by
Carson. Huestis made both
of his free throws on the
next trip down for Stanford,
and the threat was success
fully stamped out.
Stanford was able to
maintain control of this
game by dominating the
paint, as it outrebounded
ASU 40-32 en route to col
lecting 15 offensive re
bounds. The Cardinal also
outscored the Sun Devils 28-
12 in the paint and recorded
five blocks to ASU's two.
Looking ahead, Stanford
begins a crucial stretch on
the road when it plays at Cal
on Wednesday. This year
marks the third straight sea
son that Stanford has
reached the halfway point of

the conference season with a
5-4 record, and the Cardinal
hopes that the outcome will
be better this time around.
"To have a really success

have to be able to go on the
road and have some suc
cess," said head coach John
ny Dawkins. "It's going to be
important for us to go out
there focused and compete

half."
Unlike the Arizona game, Stan
ford was able to hang on to its lead
this time around despite the best
efforts of Arizona State's back
court. Sophomore Jahii Carson,

Jermaine Marshall, a prolific 3-
point shooter, combined for 46 of
Arizona State's 70 points, including
28 in the second half.

foul with 10:48 remaining, Carson
returned to the game with about
eight minutes left and rallied the
Sun Devils. He scored seven points

ASU within five with 3:15 remain
ing.

drop of a dime."

DWIGHT POWELL,

With little room for error left on
the schedule following Stanford's
near-miss loss to Arizona on
Thursday, the Cardinal men's bas
ketball team's two best players
came up big when needed most, as
the Cardinal defeated the Arizona
State Sun Devils by a 76-70 score
on Saturday afternoon. After a
slow start to the game that saw
Stanford (14-7, 5-4 Pac-12) trail the
Sun Devils (16-6, 5-4) by as many
as six points, senior forward
Dwight Powell and junior guard
Chasson Randle dominated the
second half to help Stanford come
away with the victory.

Powell matched a season high
with 28 points on 8-of-19 shooting
in addition to a 10-of-12 effort from
the foul line. Randle added 21
points in the victory, with 15 com
ing in the second half.
Much like the game against Ari
zona, a 1-point game at the half
turned into a sizable Stanford lead
after a large Cardinal run opened
the second period. Stanford began
the half on a 23-9 run to open up a
13-point lead, 55-42, with 12:14 re
maining in the game. Powell and
Randle scored 21 of the team's 23
points during the stretch, and Pow
ell assisted on the only other Stan
ford basket during the run a
Josh Huestis dunk off of an in
bounds pass.
"We were pretty close at half,
and we knew we had to come out

the first four minutes and create
some separation, because they're
obviously a great team and we're
going to fight regardless of what
the score was," Powell said. "We
definitely came out with an aggres
sive mindset to start off the second
half."
Unlike the Arizona game, Stan
