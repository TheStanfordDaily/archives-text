## STANFORD SWEEPS IN BATTLE OF THE BAY 
### LAUREN LOCKETT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's basketball team
notched its 20th consecutive victory with a 79-
64 victory over its rival, the No. 21 California
Golden Bears (14-7,6-4 Pac-12) at Haas Pavilion
in Berkeley on Sunday in the second edition of
the Battle of the Bay in under a week. The win
pushed the Cardinal to 21-1 overall this season
and a perfect 10-0 in its Pac-12 conference
games to assert itself as the clear leader in the
west. This was its seventh consecutive victory

against teams rated in the top 25 nationally this
season.

In a quick rematch after Stanford beat Cal
70-64 at Maples on Thursday, Stanford was able
to notch yet another Pac-12 victory, its second in

four days. The Cardinal was
led in scoring by senior Ail-
American forward and Na
tional Player of the Year can
didate Chiney Ogwumike's 29
points and junior point guard
Amber Orrange's 13.
Stanford started off the
beginning of the game strong,
shooting 56 percent from the
field in the first half of play
while holding the Bears to on
ly 31 percent. As she usually
does, Ogwumike was able to
dominate in the paint on Sun
day, breaking through the
double teams and help-side
defense.
"Chiney is just in there
and they've got to deal with
her and she finishes really
well," said Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer of
Ogwumike.
Ogwumike was able to
sink 10 of her 16 shots, most
of which came from down
low, in her 19th 20-point
game of the season. Due
partly to Ogwumike's suc

cess, Stanford ended the
game having scored 30
points in the paint. The dom
inance in the paint also al
lowed Stanford to get open
looks from the perimeter.
Freshman guard Karlie
Samuelson added 16 points
and shot 7-of-7 from the free
throw line, knocking six down
in the final 75 seconds of the
game when Cal stalled foul
ing in an effort to close the
gap despite the game being
out of reach with Stanford
holding a double-digit lead.
Like Samuelson, many of
the Cardinal's players outside
of Ogwumike appear to be
stepping up and becoming
more comfortable in their
roles at this point, something
Coach VanDerveer empha
sized as important to the Car
dinal's long-term success.
Redshirt senior forward
Mikaela Ruef also added nine
points, five assists and 11 re
bounds in another solid per
formance.

For Cal, junior guard Brit
tany Boyd led the charge with
20 points, six assists and six
rebounds. Though senior
guard Mikayla Lyles also
posted a career-high 16

points while shooting an im
pressive 4-of-5 from 3-point
range, the Card was able to
hold Cal's leading scorer, jun
ior forward Reshanda Gray,
to just seven points. The ag
gressive play of Ogwumike on
the offensive end forced Gray
to commit five fouls and leave
the game with more than five
minutes remaining in regula
tion.

"Tara [VanDerveer is] the
mastermind of limiting other
teams' top scorers and mak
ing other players beat you,"
said Cal head coach Lindsay
Gottlieb.

Following a sweep of the
Bears this weekend, Stanford
has now won 24 of its last 27
matchups against its rival in
Berkeley. The Card also re
mains firmly in control at the
top of the Pac-12 conference
standings with the victory.
Next weekend, the team
looks to keep its conference
record unblemished as it
travels to Washington to take
on the Washington State
Cougars and the Washington
Huskies.
