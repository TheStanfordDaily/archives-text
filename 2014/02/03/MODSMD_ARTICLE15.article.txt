## Card sweeps to win after five-set loss Stanford splits home series after two weeks on the road 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
No. 7 Stanford men's volleyball is no longer
undefeated at home. After two weeks on the
road, the Cardinal returned home to play No. 6
Long Beach State on Friday and No. 13 Cal
State Northridge on Saturday at Maples. While
the Cardinal (5-4,2-4 MPSF) defeated Cal State
Northridge in three straight sets, it lost a tough
battle against Long Beach State in five close
sets.

Friday's game against Long Beach State (5-
3, 4-3) started out well for the Cardinal, which
looked comfortable and confident back on its
home court. Stanford won the first two sets of
the match but the 49ers were able to capitalize
off of Stanford's mistakes and build momentum
to give LBSU the advantage in the final three
sets as the 49ers would go on to win, 17-25, 25-
27, 25-18, 25-18, 15-11. The 49ers came out
strong in the third set with a 9-0 run and never
let Stanford come within six in the rest of the
set. Stanford seemed discouraged and deflated,
having given up a chance to close the match in
three sets.
"I thought Long Beach upped its game after
the first two sets," head coach John Kosty told
GoStanford.com. "They did a really nice job
opening the third set. They forced our hitters
into some difficult situations and were able to
capitalize off of that momentum."
The 49ers not only outhit Stanford .238 to
.212, but also were superior on transition plays
and forced Stanford to commit errors. Stan
ford's normally strong service game was in
many ways the weakest aspect of its play on Fri
day, as the Card recorded 15 service errors.
Long Beach State was led by senior outside
hitter Taylor Crabb, who had a career-high 29
kills and two aces for the match, while senior
Connor Olbright recorded a double-double with
52 assists and 17 digs.
Stanford senior outside hitter Brian Cook
led the Cardinal with 15 kills and junior libero
Grant Delgado had an impressive match-high
18 digs for the defense. Senior middle Denny
Falls also was significant on defense with six
blocks for the night for the Cardinal.

2/1, Maples Pavilion
After the disappointing
loss at Maples on Friday,
Stanford had to return the
next night to face Cal State

Northridge (3-4. 3-3). This
time, however, the Cardinal
had more success and was
able to leave Maples with a
25-21, 25-18, 25-19 win.
Stanford demonstrated
the ability to regroup men
tally after a tough loss,
coming out strong against
the Matadors. The Cardi

nal took an early lead in the
first set and never looked
back, making sure to not al
low Cal State Northridge
the same opportunity it had
allowed Long Beach State
the night before. Stanford
limited its mistakes and
drastically improved its
service game Stanford
had eight aces for the
night, with senior opposite
Eric Mochalski responsible
for three of those aces. In
his first start of the season,
Mochalski led the Cardinal
with 11 kills and no attack
errors. He also hit .688,
showing that he was de
serving of his starting posi
tion. Cal State Northridge
was led by freshman
Damani Lenore, who also
had 11 kills.
"I was lucky tonight
that they weren't paying
too much attention to me
and I was getting a lot of
one-on-one match-ups,"
Mochalski told GoStan
ford.com. "Any opposite in
the league can put away
balls in one-on-one situa
tions. It was really a team
effort for us tonight."
With Stanford's domi
nant performance over Cal
State Northridge, it gained
some positive momentum to
carry with it when the Card
looks to improve its record in
the MPSF.
Stanford will remain at
home next week to host UC-
San Diego on Friday at 7
p.m. and UC-Irvine on Sat
urday at 12:30 p.m. The UC-
Irvine game will be broad
casted on Pac-12 Bay Area.
