# A 						Super Bowl to be easily forgotten
## 
### Michael Peterson 
Nothing beats a close,
down-to-the-wire Su
per Bowl. Not the
NBA Finals, not the
World Series and not
the BCS National Championship
Game (or now, the College Football
Playoff) â€”at least, when your fa
vorite team is not involved. The World
Cup is much more popular world
wide, but at least in the United
States, the Super Bowl currently
reigns.
With the nonstop hype that builds
up the Super Bowl for two long weeks
beforehand, the game could easily let
us down. Before 2005, there had nev
er been back-to-back Super Bowls
decided by nine or fewer points. The
first 37 Super Bowls had an average
margin of victory of 16.3 points. The
Super Bowl tended to be a one-sided
affair more often than not.
However, before the Seahawks
and the Broncos squared off on Sun
day, five of the previous six Super
Bowls, and seven of the last 10, had
been decided by six or fewer points.
You might expect this, given that the
Super Bowl is supposed to be played
between the two best teams in the
National Football League.
In 2004, an estimated 89 million
viewers watched the Panthers and
Patriots combine for 37 points in the
fourth quarter alone and saw Tom
Brady lead a game-winning fourth
quarter drive, capped off by Adam
Vinatieri's deciding field goal with
four seconds left.
In 2008, the undefeated Patriots
marched into the Super Bowl as 12-
point favorites over Eli Manning and
the Giants. With 1:15 remaining, trail
ing by four and facing a third-and-5
from the New York 44-yard line, Eli
Manning escaped a sure sack and
fired up a prayer that was answered
by David Tyree a 32-yard catch
made with one hand and a helmet.
The Giants finished the drive and up
set the Patriots 17-14 in arguably the
greatest Super Bowl of all-time.
How could that Super Bowl possi
bly be followed up? After falling be
hind 20-7 in Super Bowl XLIII, the
Cardinals responded with 16 straight
points, including a 64-yard touch
down pass with 2:37 remaining to
take a 23-20 lead. However, the Steel
ers were up to the task, marching 78
yards down the field and scoring on
one of the greatest catches of all time,
with Santonio Holmes reaching way
over his head and snaring Ben Roeth
lisberger's pass in the corner of the
end zone between three defenders
with just 35 seconds left on the clock.
In that span of 10 Super Bowls,
there had also been a pick-six to seal
a Super Bowl for New Orleans just a
few years after Hurricane Katrina, a
six-point victory for the Packers
three years removed from Brett
Favre, yet another Eli Manning
game-winning drive against the Pa
triots and a goal-line stand by one of
the greatest linebackers of all time,
Ray Lewis, to win the Super Bowl in
his final game, to mention a few of the
best.
And that is why this Super Bowl
was so unexpected.
The Broncos ruined not only this
streak of stellar games but also this
Super Bowl. Over 100 million people
watched as Peyton Manning and the
Broncos made mistake after mistake
for foui' quarters. Despite the poten
tial for one of the greatest games
ever, with the most prolific offense in
history taking on the league's best de
fense, the game instead made a
mockery of the Broncos.
What happened? The first play of
the game really told the whole story
everything that could go wrong for
the Broncos went wrong. Manning's
throws were off, the Broncos' defense
couldn't get off the field on third
downs and the Broncos' special teams
left a lane so wide for Percy Harvin
you could drive a semi-track through
it. Maybe the pressure got to the
Broncos, but there is no doubt that
the Seahawks were by far the best
team on the field and in the NFL on
Sunday.
Unfortunately for fans of the 31
teams other than the Seahawks, the
Super Bowl was over just 15 seconds
after halftime when Percy Harvin re
toned the second-half kickoff for a
touchdown.
After so many amazing Super
Bowls, it's safe to say that the Bron
cos let us down Sunday. We became
spoiled watching game-winning
drives and historic plays year after
year for the last 10 years to the point

where I kept expecting Pey
ton Manning to pull off the
spectacular comeback. But on
this occasion, the Super Bowl
reverted to blowout form, and
it really wasn't all that excit
ing to watch beyond the first
half.
Hopefully, future Super
Bowls can again be the spec
tacular showings we have
come to assume they would be
all-out battles between the
two best teams for football's
ultimate prize that have our
gazes fixed and hearts racing
for a full 60 minutes. Football
is at its finest when the best
and most exciting moments of
the season are saved for last.

Michael Peterson, along
with other Stanford stu
dents who chose to watch the
Super Bold instead of
studying, is bitter that he
wasted three hours of his
weekend. Tell him how to
make up for lost time at mr
