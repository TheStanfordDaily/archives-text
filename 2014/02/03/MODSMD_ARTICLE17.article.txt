# FIVE IN A ROW
## Cardinal goes undefeated in Stanford Invite 
### DYLAN FUGEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford
women's water polo team (4-
0) got its season off to a per
fect start this weekend, re
taining the Stanford Invite ti
tle for a fifth straight year by
beating No. 3 UCLA 8-4 in
the final. Stanford had fought
through a very competitive
Bracket A in the preliminary
round of the tournament,
beating out No. 17 UC-Davis
16-3, No. 6 Hawaii 16-5 and
No. 5 UC-Irvine 13-9.

Junior driver Kiley
Neushul and sophomore
driver Anna Yelizarova led
the team with 11 goals each
over the course of the tourna
ment. Neushul included a hat
trick against Hawaii and five
goals against UC-Davis,
while Yelizarova had three
separate hat tricks in tourna
ment play. They were ably
backed up by the stellar play
of sophomore driver Maggie
Steffens, who notched seven
goals for the tournament,
and sophomore goalie Gabby
Stone, who had 10 saves in
the final and 22 over the two
days of tournament play.

The Cardinal had to en
dure some nerve-wracking
moments over the course of
the tournament after UC-
Irvine took an early 3-1 lead
in the final preliminary game
through goals from senior
drivers Annika Bergesen and
Hillary Estrada and another
goal from junior driver
Danielle Warde. However,
the Cardinal came back
strong behind the play of
Neushul and Yelizarova, both
of whom scored two goals in
order to give the Cardinal an
8-6 halftime lead that it
would not relinquish. The
match continued its back
and-forth pace over the final
two periods, but the game
was closed out by senior two-

W. WATER POLO
NO. 3 UCLA 4
NO. 2 STANFORD 8
2/2, Avery Aquatic Center
meter Annika Dries, who put away
two crucial goals to lead the team
to its 13-9 victory and a spot in the
final.
A similar pattern of play
emerged in the final, as Stanford
put away what had been a very
tight game in the second half of the
contest. Leading 3-2 at halftime
thanks to goals from Steffens,
Yelizarova and senior driver Kelsey
Suggs, Stanford came out ener
gized in the second half and, in fact,
held the Bruins scoreless until the
five-minute mark in the fourth

quarter.
In the intervening time, the
game was broken open by four
goals from Neushul, Dries, Stef
fens and Yelizarova, who had
emerged at this point as the Cardi
nal's key contributors in its march
towards the title. In the end, the
margin of victory was fairly com
fortable and the Cardinal will like
ly be very pleased with its level of
performance in what was a very
competitive tournament.
Hoping to continue its stellar
start to the season, the Cardinal
will next travel to Santa Clara on
Feb. 12 for another non-conference
match-up.
