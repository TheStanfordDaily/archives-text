## Laptop theft spree hits Green Library Green Library staff looks to boost awareness after thefts 
### CALEB SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Following four laptop thefts last
month, the Green Library staff has en
gaged in an awareness campaign in
tended to encourage library patrons to
not leave personal belongings unat
tended.
According to Gabrielle Karam
pelas, director of library communica
tions and development, internal li
brary records indicate that the last re
ported laptop thefts in Green Library
were in June 2007 and January 2010,
with one laptop stolen in each case.
"[Four laptop thefts] is definitely
out of the norm," Karampelas said.
Karampelas said that the stolen
laptops had been left unattended for
periods of time varying from five min
utes to 50 minutes. She emphasized
that thefts could occur even when be
longings are only briefly left unattend
ed and urged students to call the Stan
ford University Department of Public
Safety (SUDPS) whenever they see
something suspicious.
"Have that number, keep that num
ber [and] keep it handy," Karampelas
said.
SUDPS spokesman Bill Larson
noted that the existence of check-in
stations at library entrances likely
means that the recent thefts were car
ried out by a University-affiliated indi
vidual with library privileges.
While Green Library staff do not
plan on taking any new security meas
ures beyond ongoing efforts, they have
continued their awareness campaign,
which features notices posted around
the library reminding students of the
latest thefts and encouraging them to
keep their belongings with them at all
times.
"The security in the library is fair
ly tight," Karampelas said.
Karampelas added that the library
staff conducts library walk-throughs
during which staff members attach
tags to unattended laptops that warn
owners that their laptop could have
been stolen. More walk-throughs are
planned during finals and at the begin-
ning of quarters.
According to Larson,
SUDPS staff conducted
walk-throughs in the past.
The department has also
trained library staff to help

them recognize suspicious
activity.
Meanwhile, students
have also been encouraged
to practice their own safety
measures by keeping a
watchful eye on their belong
ings.
"I think it's definitely put
me a little bit more on
guard," said Mark Wieland
'l3 M.A. 'l4, who added that

he has taken new measures
to keep his laptop safe.
Larson said that laptops
and mobile devices tend to
be the biggest targets for
thefts, but library staff urge
students to remember not to
leave less valuable posses
sions unattended as well.

After four laptops were stolen, Green Library staff began a campaign to increase awareness of the risks by posting signs throughout the library and
placing notes on unsupervised laptops. Prior to the recent thefts, the last laptop reported to have been stolen from the library was in January 2010.
