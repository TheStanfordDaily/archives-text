# BROKEN RECORDS
## 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford's track and field teams
toppled four previous school
records as Cardinal athletes raced
to several eye-popping individual
performances at the Penn State Na

tional Invitational over the week
end.
A four-person team of sopho
mores Amy Weissenbach, Kristyn
Williams and Claudia Saunders
along with fifth-year senior Justine
Fedronic finished the women's dis
tance medley relay in 10:54.04 on

Friday a full four seconds faster
than the previous school record of
10:58.49 set in 2009. The time also
marks the fastest distance medley
relay time in the country so far this
year.
It was the second school-record
performance of the year for
Williams, who gave the relay team
good separation with her strong
400-meter leg of the relay on Friday
after having set a Stanford record
in the 400 at the UW Indoor Pre
view in January. She went on to add
a third school-record time on Satur
day.
In Saturday's races, the Cardi
nal continued to build off of its mo
mentum from Friday as Fedronic
and Williams claimed two more
school records in the women's 800-
meter and 500-meter invitationals,
respectively. In addition, sopho
more Steven Solomon contributed a
record-breaking performance for
the men's team in the men's 500-
meter invitational.
Fedronic led the Cardinal to a
sweep of the top three spots in the
800 with her time of 2:03.25, with
sophomores Amy Weissenbach and
Claudia Saunders clocking in at
2:05.50 and 2:07.17, respectively, to
claim second and third. Both Fe
dronic's and Weissenbach's times
topped the previous Stanford
record of 2:05.56, which was set by
Weissenbach last year. In addition,
Fedronic's time set a new meet
record and a new track record, both
of which previously stood at
2:03.51.
In the men's 500 invitational,
Solomon ran a 1:01.44 to beat the
previous school record of 1:03.40
that had stood since 1983, partly
due to the rarity of the 500 event.
Williams' time of 1:10.82 in the
women's 500 invitational will go
down as a school record despite the
lack of an official list for the event.
At the Razorback Invitational in
Fayetteville, Ark., freshman pole
vaulter Dylan Duvio tied a personal
record and won the men's pole vault
event with his vault of 17-4?, which
also marks the second-best fresh
man vault in Stanford history.
With the new school records be
ing set and several Cardinal ath
letes setting new personal records,
Stanford's teams look to be in excel
lent physical condition moving for
ward into the U.S. Indoor Champi
onships later this month.
