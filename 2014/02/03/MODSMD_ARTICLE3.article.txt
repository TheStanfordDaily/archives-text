### â€” Andrew Vogeley 
Hannah Valantine, senior associate
dean for diversity and leadership at
the School of Medicine, has been
named the National Institute of
Health's (NIH) first-ever chief officer
for scientific workforce diversity.
Valantine, who has held her posi
tion since 2005 and who also serves as
a professor of cardiovascular medi
cine, will oversee the NlH's attempts
to diversify its researching corps by
advancing strategies to increase mi
nority recruitment and retention
while simultaneously creating a cul
ture of inclusivity.
Under Valantine's leadership, the
School of Medicine reported an in
crease in the number of female faculty
members to levels above national av
erages. The number of faculty from
under-represented minority groups
has also increased, from 34 in 2004 to
96 in 2014.
"Recruiting and retaining the
brightest minds regardless of race,
ethnicity, gender, disability and so
cioeconomic status is critically impor
tant not only to NIH, but to the entire
U.S. scientific enterprise," said NIH
Director Francis Collins in a press re
lease. "Hannah possesses the experi
ence, dedication and tenacity needed
to move the NIH forward on this crit
ically important issue."
