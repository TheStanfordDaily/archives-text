# ASSU leadership reflects on term
## Ashton and Gallagher focus on student voice 
### ANDREW VOGELEY DESK EDITOR 
With three-quarters of their
term in office completed, this
year's ASSU Executives and mem
bers of the 15th Undergraduate
Senate sat down with The Daily to
discuss their accomplishments in
office to date and what remains to
be done.
Executives' focus on communi
cation
ASSU Co-Presidents Dan Ash
ton 'l4 and Billy Gallagher 'l4 sin
gled out their work in facilitating
more efficient communication be
tween University administrators
and the student body, as well as
within the ASSU.
"Something that was lacking
was the complementary support
from the structured student voice,
which is the ASSU," Gallagher
said. "We wanted to make ASSU
more accessible, more of that stu
dent voice."
Ashton cited the accelerated se

lection of this year's Nominations
Commission (NomCom) a
group of seven students charged
with selecting approximately 200
individuals to serve on University
committees as student representa
tives and a more extensive dia
logue between NomCom members
and the Executives as reflective of
efforts to ensure student voices are
properly heard.
"That is the highest impact we
have and all that is run through
NomCom," Ashton said.
Both Ashton and Gallagher also
described their positive relation
ship and increased communica
tions with the Senate as crucial to
the success of several of their pro
posals and initiatives. For example,
Ashton and Senator Ilya
Mouzykantskii 'l6 spearheaded
discussions with University admin
istrators over controversial pro
posed class scheduling changes.
"Bringing back the Executive
Committee has been really help
ful," Gallagher noted, referencing a
committee that brings together the

Executives and the leaderships of
the Senate, Graduate Student
Council and Stanford Student En
terprises.
Ashton and Gallagher also em
phasized other positive accomplish
ments from the first three-quar
ters of their term, such as the in
troduction of all-school tailgates
before football games and work
done with the Career Development
Center to develop resources to as
sist students pursuing "social im
pact" careers.
Senate's procedural improvements
The Senate has also focused on
ways to make the legislative
branch of the ASSU a more repre
sentative, efficient and effective or
ganization, recently passing bills
that reserve three Senate seats for
upperclassmen traditionally un
derrepresented in the body and
allow for senators to study abroad
while serving, a restriction that has
often been cited as further limiting
the number of upperclassmen on
Senate and increasing turnover

from year to year.
Beyond changes to the elections
process, much of the Senate's at
tention has been focused on fund
ing practices, with several senators
pointing to the passage of the Stu
dent Activities Fee (SAFE) Re
form as the biggest task left to ac
complish.
The SAFE Reform would fun
damentally restructure how stu
dent groups ask for and access
money while also making the
process by which the Senate can
distribute those funds more effi
cient. Ashton and Gallagher said
that they hope to have the SAFE
Reform approved by the Senate in
time for it to be voted on by the stu
dent body in the spring elections.
"There are a lot of non-existent,
defunct groups that still have mon
ey in then- accounts that can't be
touched," Ashton noted.
As their time in office nears an
end, however, several senators ex
pressed frustration with the bu-

reaucratic elements of both
the University and the AS
SU, and the ensuing difficul
ty of effecting substantive
change.
"It is incredibly hard to
get the status quo to
change," Mouzykantskii
said.
