## Di Suvero sculpture relocated 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
A 23-foot tall sculpture by Mark
di Suvero has been moved across
campus in recent weeks and is now
almost completely installed in its
new home.
The sculpture, titled "The Sieve
of Eratosthenes," was previously
located near Cantor Arts Center,
but the construction of the Ander
son Collection building forced Can
tor staff to relocate the sculpture to
the grassy area between the Es
condido turnaround and Meyer Li
brary.
According to Susan K. Roberts-
Manganelli, manager for collec
tions, exhibits and conservation at
Cantor, the new location was cho
sen because the open space will al
low passersby to appreciate the
scale of the work.
"This is a big piece and so you
need a lot of space," Roberts-Man
ganelli explained. "We never really
liked the installation over by the
museum. It was kind of hidden and
the artist wasn't pleased, so I think
he'll like this one a lot.
Because of its size, the sculp

ture had to be taken apart and re
assembled in order to move it.
Roberts-Manganelli said that the
University worked closely with a
fine arts handler and di Suvero
himself to protect the work during
transport.
"We always talk to the artist if
the artist is still alive, and so we
spoke with the artist and [the han
dlers] spoke with di Suvero,"
Roberts-Manganelli said. "They
talked about how best to take it

apart because you can't obviously
take this and lift it up on a crane
and put it on the back of a flatbed."
Cantor staff also discussed the
features of the new installment
with di Suvero, particularly the
square wooded-off areas where the
feet of the sculpture are placed.
"The footings for [the sculp
ture] over by the museum were
considered inappropriate for this
location, so we had to design some
new footings so it would be secure,"

Roberts-Manganelli said. 'Again,
we had to talk to the artist about
that and make sure that he agreed
that the footings were right."
"Sieve" is one of two di Suvero
pieces on campus —the other is
"Miwok," a stainless steel work lo
cated on the Dean's Lawn at the
School of Medicine. Roberts-Man
ganelli said that the experience of
moving that sculpture in August

Mark di Suvero's sculpture, "The Sieve of Eratosthenes," was relocated from Cantor Arts Center to the
Escondido turnaround in front of Meyer Library due to construction on the Anderson Collection Building.
2012 eased the planning
process this time around.
Despite the best efforts of
the handlers, the piece still
needs retouching after the
move, which Roberts-Man
ganelli said was normal pro
cedure.
"Where the welding oc
curred, they removed some
of the paint from the piece
with the welder and then
added new pieces of metal
as well," said Amanda
Lynn, who painted the piece
when it was first installed
and will perform the touch
up work. "I'm going to be
protecting the metal by us
ing primer and paint for
cosmetic sakes and also to
prevent rust."
Roberts-Manganelli em
phasized that everything is
done in accordance with the
artist's wishes.
"We always talk to the
artist and keep extensive
notes on what he says and
what he wants," Roberts-
Manganelli said. She added
the museum keeps detailed
records of interviews and
conversations so that even if
an artist is no longer alive,
the integrity of the piece is
maintained.
According to Roberts-
Manganelli, the piece will
be fully installed and the
fence surrounding it taken
down in about a month, after
the retouching work has
been completed and the sod
set. At that time, Cantor will
hold an event to introduce
the piece to the community.
"We'll be having an event
around it so that people
know what it's all about," she
said. "It's here in the middle
of a well-used lawn so we
want people to understand
what's going on."

Mark di Suvero's sculpture, "The Sieve of Eratosthenes," was relocated from Cantor Arts Center to the
Escondido turnaround in front of Meyer Library due to construction on the Anderson Collection Building.
2012 eased the planning
process this time around.
Despite the best efforts of
the handlers, the piece still
needs retouching after the
move, which Roberts-Man
ganelli said was normal pro
cedure.
"Where the welding oc
curred, they removed some
of the paint from the piece
with the welder and then
added new pieces of metal
as well," said Amanda
Lynn, who painted the piece
when it was first installed
and will perform the touch
up work. "I'm going to be
protecting the metal by us
ing primer and paint for
cosmetic sakes and also to
prevent rust."
Roberts-Manganelli em
phasized that everything is
done in accordance with the
artist's wishes.
"We always talk to the
artist and keep extensive
notes on what he says and
what he wants," Roberts-
Manganelli said. She added
the museum keeps detailed
records of interviews and
conversations so that even if
an artist is no longer alive,
the integrity of the piece is
maintained.
According to Roberts-
Manganelli, the piece will
be fully installed and the
fence surrounding it taken
down in about a month, after
the retouching work has
been completed and the sod
set. At that time, Cantor will
hold an event to introduce
the piece to the community.
"We'll be having an event
around it so that people
know what it's all about," she
said. "It's here in the middle
of a well-used lawn so we
want people to understand
what's going on."
