## Di Suvero sculpture relocated 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
A 23-foot tall sculpture by Mark
di Suvero has been moved across
campus in recent weeks and is now
almost completely installed in its
new home.
The sculpture, titled "The Sieve
of Eratosthenes," was previously
located near Cantor Arts Center,
but the construction of the Ander
son Collection building forced Can
tor staff to relocate the sculpture to
the grassy area between the Es
condido turnaround and Meyer Li
brary.
According to Susan K. Roberts-
Manganelli, manager for collec
tions, exhibits and conservation at
Cantor, the new location was cho
sen because the open space will al
low passersby to appreciate the
scale of the work.
"This is a big piece and so you
need a lot of space," Roberts-Man
ganelli explained. "We never really
liked the installation over by the
museum. It was kind of hidden and
the artist wasn't pleased, so I think
he'll like this one a lot.
Because of its size, the sculp

ture had to be taken apart and re
assembled in order to move it.
Roberts-Manganelli said that the
University worked closely with a
fine arts handler and di Suvero
himself to protect the work during
transport.
"We always talk to the artist if
the artist is still alive, and so we
spoke with the artist and [the han
dlers] spoke with di Suvero,"
Roberts-Manganelli said. "They
talked about how best to take it

apart because you can't obviously
take this and lift it up on a crane
and put it on the back of a flatbed."
Cantor staff also discussed the
features of the new installment
with di Suvero, particularly the
square wooded-off areas where the
feet of the sculpture are placed.
"The footings for [the sculp
ture] over by the museum were
considered inappropriate for this
location, so we had to design some
new footings so it would be secure,"

Roberts-Manganelli said. 'Again,
we had to talk to the artist about
that and make sure that he agreed
that the footings were right."
"Sieve" is one of two di Suvero
pieces on campus â€”the other is
"Miwok," a stainless steel work lo
cated on the Dean's Lawn at the
School of Medicine. Roberts-Man
ganelli said that the experience of
moving that sculpture in August
