# FROM THE OPINIONS DESK
## Forever new 
### Winston Shi 
The word new is the eternal
watchword of Silicon Valley. It
is both shifting and perma
nent; like fire, it simultaneously
represents destruction and rebirth.
Today, I am faced with newness as I
have never faced it before. I should
introduce myself my name is
Winston Shi, and I am the new
Managing Editor of Opinions at
The Stanford Daily.
My first act as head of the opin
ions desk, as with my final act at the
sports section, must be to thank and
acknowledge the man that came be
fore me. Our outgoing Opinions Ed
itor, Aaron Sekhri, helped me even
in those early days when I never ex
pected this opportunity to come. To
him I owe a debt of gratitude.
One of the things that Aaron
taught me was the unavoidability
and promise of the new. It is, to be
sure, a strange new world that we
face today at The Daily. It seems at
times that no industry faces more
change than ours.
In an age where newspapers
face steadily intensifying pressure
from every competitor under the
sun, newspapers need to redefine
themselves. This is not rocket sci
ence; in any case, my path has tak
en me well clear of Engineering
Quad. This is the dilemma that
every newspaper faces. It would not
be too much of an exaggeration to
say that the industry has been fac
ing this problem for over a decade.
What do we know, then? We
know that legitimacy is what we
have and need to maintain. We
know that in this new environment,
great writing will be rewarded
more than ever. Our edge, as al
ways, is threefold: our writers, our
tradition and the resources and tal
ent of the community we serve. Far
from choking off The Daily, the Web
revolution has expanded our reach
and our abilities. I know for a fact
that this newspaper extends be
yond Campus Drive.
That is, however, only true if we
can bring in quality.
What the last decade has taught
us is that our readers do not shy
away from complexity and nuance.
They demand it. You demand it.
The opinions section has the op
portunity to bring more perspec
tives than ever before. We are a
space for the entire Stanford com
munity to share its collective knowl
edge.
That's why we're introducing
the Op-Ed series, where many dif
ferent writers can bring their dif
ferent perspectives to bear on the
issues that typify our lives and our
society. If we will admit that life is
illustrated not in black and white
but in subtle shades of gray, this in
stitution is a necessary step to-

wards complementing the quality
that our columnists already pro
vide. That's also why we're trying to
expand our coverage to the gradu
ate schools and to current events.
And that's absolutely why we want
more independent op-eds than ever
before.
Quality generates legitimacy; le
gitimacy leads to interest; interest
brings in readers; and readers en
sure our future.
Volume 244 of the Stanford Dai
ly is over, and Volume 245 has just
begun. We have new faces. We have
new staff. We have new views, and
we certainly have new opportuni
ties.
I will be the first to admit that
change is terrifying. But change is
no curse. It is ultimately change
that brings us possibilities and
possibilities are the foundation of
the future.
For those of you who stalwartly
read Opinions every day, welcome
back. To those of you who know me
from the sports section, thank you
for your support. And to those of
you who are picking up The Daily
for the first time, keep on reading
we're glad to have you here.
Your interest has made my job
possible. Thank you very much.
