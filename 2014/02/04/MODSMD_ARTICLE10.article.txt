## SUPER TUESDAY The 						State of the Executive 
### Josh Jones 
The President's State of the
Union last Tuesday was
somewhat conventional with
its heartwarming accounts of
American industry and selective
use of statistics, but it definitely
provided a good snapshot of the
current role of the executive
branch in American politics.
The issue that has received the
most attention from media outlets
was President Obama's promise to
"take steps without legislation to
expand opportunity for more
American families," "wherever and
whenever" he could. Later in his
speech, the President promised to
use this asserted executive authori
ty to raise the minimum wage for
all federal contractors. This cava
lier attitude towards the separation
of powers set forth in the Constitu
tion is shocking: The executive and
legislative powers are set up pre
cisely to prevent the emergence of
a king-like protector who writes the
laws he will later enforce.
Ironically, the President seemed
very eager to pass the buck to Con
gress on challenging issues such as
immigration, Guantanamo Bay and
NSA surveillance programs. The
executive does in fact have a lot of
control over these issues, but un
fortunately Obama has proven
more eager to exercise his execu
tive prerogative to ignore laws he
disagrees with than to protect con
stitutional rights.
In the last year, Obama has
made liberal use of the executive
order to scale back the deporta
tions of illegal immigrants and to
routinely modify the Affordable
Care Act, most notably delaying
the employer mandate until 2015.
In contrast, Guantanamo Bay re
mains open, and surveillance activi
ties have only grown more intru
sive since the Bush years.
Despite calls to hand our chil
dren "a safer, more stable world"
and get serious about economic
growth, there was little mention of
the nation's out-of-control spending
or ballooning debt. The President
had few suggestions for reform, but
he made sure to point out that the
national deficit had been cut in half
in 2013. This is true, but so is the
fact that this deficit was over a tril
lion dollars each year for Obama's
entire first term. Under his watch,
the national debt has soared from
11 to 17 trillion dollars. So Obama's
goal to have immigration reform
save a trillion dollars over the next
ten years, while commendable, is
hardly enough to "[bring] down our
deficit in a balanced way."
Of course, there was the manda
tory shout-out to the Affordable
Care Act, which may well be the
lasting legacy of the Obama Admin
istration. The President chose his
words carefully as he declared that
"more than nine million Americans
have signed up for private health
insurance or Medicaid coverage."
He was careful because it's unclear
how many of those people had al
ready been covered by private in
surance or Medicaid. He also neg
lected to mention the estimated
four to five million Americans who
have received cancellation notices
from their private insurance com
panies because of the law's new re
quirements.

However, the speech certainly
had its merits. The President's fo
cus on immigration reform in
spired Republicans to release a
statement on the issue later that
week, and leaders of both parties

have shown interest in finding
common ground. Freedom and free
markets demand that people be
free to travel and trade, and it ap
pears that a path to citizenship
may finally be laid out for all those
who wish to claim the blessings
America has to offer.
Some of the President's foreign
policy remarks were also laudable.
Obama commented, "We must
fight the battles that need to be
fought, not those that terrorists
prefer from us large-scale de
ployments that drain our strength
and may ultimately feed extrem
ism," and he later declared, "Amer
ica must move off a permanent war
footing." This is not only important
for the sake of fiscal responsibility,
but also because war is often used
as an excuse to expand the govern
ment and infringe on civil liberties.
Unfortunately, the Obama Ad
ministration's policies over the past
five years in combination with oth
er comments in the State of the
Union suggest that all this may
have been little more than lip serv
ice. The President admitted that a
"small force of Americans" (10,000-
strong according to news reports)
could stay in Afghanistan after the
war officially ends this year, and
that we should "aggressively pur
sue terrorist networks" in Yemen,
Somalia, Iraq, Mali and Syria.
Though he claimed he wouldn't
send troops into harm's way unless
it were "truly necessary," we
should remember that the Presi
dent doesn't have full authority, at
least in theory to decide when to
send troops into battle. While the
War Powers Resolution of 1973 a
resolution that presidents have
long chafed at allows undeclared
military engagements of up to 60
days, only Congress can declare
war under the Constitution. Recent
debacles in the Middle East have
shown what happens when we dis
regard these safeguards.
Frankly, it's scary that a presi
dent is not only tolerated, but
cheered and applauded when he an
nounces intentions to bypass Con
gress, continue foreign wars and ig
nore Fourth Amendment protec
tions with the NSA's warrantless
mass data collection. If anything,
the State of the Union revealed just
how willing Americans are to ac
cept government overreach and
lawlessness if a proposed policy's
intentions or goals are deemed suf
ficiently 'good' or 'important' or
if the perpetrator happens to be
long to their party.
We cannot accept this. We may
not all agree on what laws ought to
be passed or repealed, but it is cru
cial to both liberty and order that
we abide by the ones we have. We
undermine the power of our laws
and the very legitimacy of our gov
ernment when we obey only at our
convenience.

mains open, and surveillance activi
ties have only grown more intru
sive since the Bush years.
Despite calls to hand our chil
dren "a safer, more stable world"
and get serious about economic
growth, there was little mention of
the nation's out-of-control spending
or ballooning debt. The President
had few suggestions for reform, but
he made sure to point out that the
national deficit had been cut in half
in 2013. This is true, but so is the
fact that this deficit was over a tril
lion dollars each year for Obama's
entire first term. Under his watch,
the national debt has soared from
11 to 17 trillion dollars. So Obama's
goal to have immigration reform
save a trillion dollars over the next
ten years, while commendable, is
hardly enough to "[bring] down our
deficit in a balanced way."
Of course, there was the manda
tory shout-out to the Affordable
Care Act, which may well be the
lasting legacy of the Obama Admin
istration. The President chose his
words carefully as he declared that
"more than nine million Americans
have signed up for private health
insurance or Medicaid coverage."
He was careful because it's unclear
how many of those people had al
ready been covered by private in
surance or Medicaid. He also neg
lected to mention the estimated
four to five million Americans who
have received cancellation notices
from their private insurance com
panies because of the law's new re
quirements.

However, the speech certainly
had its merits. The President's fo
cus on immigration reform in
spired Republicans to release a
statement on the issue later that
week, and leaders of both parties

have shown interest in finding
common ground. Freedom and free
markets demand that people be
free to travel and trade, and it ap
pears that a path to citizenship
may finally be laid out for all those
who wish to claim the blessings
America has to offer.
Some of the President's foreign
policy remarks were also laudable.
Obama commented, "We must
fight the battles that need to be
fought, not those that terrorists
prefer from us large-scale de
ployments that drain our strength
and may ultimately feed extrem
ism," and he later declared, "Amer
ica must move off a permanent war
footing." This is not only important
for the sake of fiscal responsibility,
but also because war is often used
as an excuse to expand the govern
ment and infringe on civil liberties.
Unfortunately, the Obama Ad
ministration's policies over the past
five years in combination with oth
er comments in the State of the
Union suggest that all this may
have been little more than lip serv
ice. The President admitted that a
"small force of Americans" (10,000-
strong according to news reports)
could stay in Afghanistan after the
war officially ends this year, and
that we should "aggressively pur
sue terrorist networks" in Yemen,
Somalia, Iraq, Mali and Syria.
Though he claimed he wouldn't
send troops into harm's way unless
it were "truly necessary," we
should remember that the Presi
dent doesn't have full authority, at
least in theory to decide when to
send troops into battle. While the
War Powers Resolution of 1973 a
resolution that presidents have
long chafed at allows undeclared
military engagements of up to 60
days, only Congress can declare
war under the Constitution. Recent
debacles in the Middle East have
shown what happens when we dis
regard these safeguards.
Frankly, it's scary that a presi
dent is not only tolerated, but
cheered and applauded when he an
nounces intentions to bypass Con
gress, continue foreign wars and ig
nore Fourth Amendment protec
tions with the NSA's warrantless
mass data collection. If anything,
the State of the Union revealed just
how willing Americans are to ac
cept government overreach and
lawlessness if a proposed policy's
intentions or goals are deemed suf
ficiently 'good' or 'important' or
if the perpetrator happens to be
long to their party.
We cannot accept this. We may
not all agree on what laws ought to
be passed or repealed, but it is cru
cial to both liberty and order that
we abide by the ones we have. We
undermine the power of our laws
and the very legitimacy of our gov
ernment when we obey only at our
convenience.

Under [Obama],
the national debt
has soared from 11
to 17 trillion dollars.
The President's State of the
Union last Tuesday was
somewhat conventional with
its heartwarming accounts of
American industry and selective
use of statistics, but it definitely
provided a good snapshot of the
current role of the executive
branch in American politics.
The issue that has received the
most attention from media outlets
was President Obama's promise to
"take steps without legislation to
expand opportunity for more
American families," "wherever and
whenever" he could. Later in his
speech, the President promised to
use this asserted executive authori
ty to raise the minimum wage for
all federal contractors. This cava
lier attitude towards the separation
of powers set forth in the Constitu
tion is shocking: The executive and
legislative powers are set up pre
cisely to prevent the emergence of
a king-like protector who writes the
laws he will later enforce.
Ironically, the President seemed
very eager to pass the buck to Con
gress on challenging issues such as
immigration, Guantanamo Bay and
NSA surveillance programs. The
executive does in fact have a lot of
control over these issues, but un
fortunately Obama has proven
more eager to exercise his execu
tive prerogative to ignore laws he
disagrees with than to protect con
stitutional rights.
In the last year, Obama has
made liberal use of the executive
order to scale back the deporta
tions of illegal immigrants and to
routinely modify the Affordable
Care Act, most notably delaying
the employer mandate until 2015.
In contrast, Guantanamo Bay re
mains open, and surveillance activi
ties have only grown more intru
sive since the Bush years.
Despite calls to hand our chil
