## The 						Drought and Our New Necessity 
### Amy Fritz 
As an active graduate student
in the Stanford community, I
am disappointed in Stan
ford's handling of the announce
ment of California's drought emer
gency. With the lowest rainfall in
the Bay Area in recorded history,
snow-pack at less than 20% of nor
mal in the Sierras and reservoirs in
Santa Clara County at 3%-capacity
as of the end of January, water
shortages are imminent. The gover
nor of California has asked resi
dents and businesses alike to curtail
water usage in an attempt to reduce
use by 20%.
As a leading university in the
United States, I believe it is Stan
ford's duty not only to academically
educate its students but also to
teach them to positively influence

their greater community. Stanford
should announce the drought emer
gency to its students and give advice
about how they can help conserve
water. It should set an example by
cutting water consumption, perhaps
through a reduced grass-watering
schedule. It should make students
aware and get them involved.
Here is an example of the cur
rent mental state of many Stanford
students: I was leaving the dining
hall one evening with friends after a
particularly stressful day, and I
asked them what I should do to re
lax. They told me to enjoy an hour
long shower. I commented that we
were in a drought, and I probably
shouldn't do that. They laughed and
replied that it didn't matter since I
was just one person and we weren't

paying for the water.
Stanford students are future
leaders of America. It takes more
than academic intelligence to be a
leader, and Stanford has the oppor
tunity to foster a responsible societal
attitude in these future leaders.
Stanford can start by promoting a
constructive response to the drought
emergency. It should make students
aware of how their water use affects
the Stanford community and the
greater California community. Be a
leader on water conservation.
