# SUPER TUESDAY
## SOTU in Three Words 
### Nick Ahamed 
Congress: Act Now was the
clear message of President
Obama's State of the Union
last Tuesday. It came with the corol
lary: If you don't, I will.
This scorn deviated from Oba
ma's typical style. Each of the Pres
ident's five previous SOTU ad
dresses was in response to a specif
ic event and focused on the associat
ed issue. In 2013, he called for gun
control legislation after the tragedy
at Sandy Hook. In 2012, he laid out
his reelection campaign platform;
one year earlier, he reacted to the
rise of the Tea Party the previous
November. And in his first, the new
President responded to a shrinking
economy and the fiscal collapse.
While 2013 was replete was sim
ilar events, perhaps the most signif
icant political event of that kind was
the government shutdown. Howev
er, in responding to the shutdown,
the President focused less on budg
etary policy and more on the poli
tics.
More than any other event, the
shutdown represented a Washing
ton that is literally paralyzed by
polarization. In fact, the shutdown
is only the ugly face of the actual is
sue at hand: gridlock. This affects
much more than budgetary politics
indeed, it has slowed nearly
every single item on the President's
six State of the Union agendas.
In focusing on gridlock rather

than advancing a new legislative
agenda, Obama not only recapped
the many challenges our country
faces, but also reminded Congress
that it has the power to (help) solve
them. Just three minutes into his
address, he declared: "The question
for everyone in this chamber, run
ning through every decision we
make this year, is whether we are
going to help or hinder this
progress."
Thus, in many ways, the policies
proposed were rehashed from pre
vious speeches. This was made ex
plicit frequently. "Last year, I asked
this Congress to help states make
high-quality pre-K available to
every four-year-old. As a parent as
well as a President, I repeat that re
quest tonight," Obama stated.
Likewise, on issues like unem
ployment insurance and transporta
tion, he reprimanded Congress and
especially the GOP-controlled
House for its inaction. On one of the
most prominent of these issues, the
President said: "Fix our broken im
migration system. Republicans and
Democrats in the Senate have act
ed. I know that members of both
parties in the House want to do the
same."
Yet, it took a year longer for the
House to release its immigration re
form plan, compared to the Senate.
If and when action will be taken re
mains unclear.
Going in a different direction,
President Obama rightly asked the
House of Representatives to stop
wasting days in session with mean
ingless votes to repeal the Afford
able Care Act. He added: "The first
forty were plenty. We got it. We all
owe it to the American people to say
what we're for, not just what we're
against."
This is emblematic of our do
nothing Congress. It passed only 56
laws in 2013, according to the LA
Times. Even Harry Truman's "do
nothing Congress" passed 906. In

deed, three-fourths of Americans
agree with the "do-nothing label," a
CNN poll demonstrates.
Even still, Republicans are trim
ming back their agenda. This com
plies with the GOP campaign slogan
that since any government is bad
government, fewer laws ensure a
freer America.
Thus, President Obama pledged
to do more on his own: "America
does not stand still and neither
will I. So wherever and whenever I
can take steps without legisla
tion to expand opportunity for
more American families, that's
what I'm going to do."
For example, Vice President
Biden was asked to review the na
tion's job-training programs and of
fer a set of recommendations for
improvement. Obama added: "And
if Congress wants to help, you can
concentrate funding on proven pro
grams that connect more ready-to
work Americans with ready-to-be
filled jobs."
In another instance, he told
"every mayor, governor and state
legislator in America" not to "wait
for Congress to act" on the mini
mum wage. Going further, he com
mitted to issuing an executive order
to increase federal employees' min
imum wage from $7.25 to $lO.lO.
Even that promise was a throw
back: increasing the minimum wage
was a policy laid out in the 2013
State of the Union.
The frequent promises of execu
tive orders or executive action led
some to label him a tyrant, or in the
case of one Republican congress
man, a "socialist dictator." However,
this simply is not supported by the
facts. Obama issues executive or
ders at a rate of 0.09 per day, which
is the lowest rate since Grover
Cleveland was president.
In the end, this State of the
Union seemed less substantive than
past addresses. However, I argue
that Obama's promise to take inde
pendent action on proposals he's al
ready offered to Congress actually
makes his speech more meaningful
and suggests that 2014 could be
more productive. Now we must
hope that a hostile Republican
House of Representatives will seek
influence by cooperating rather
than watch its power disappear to
an active executive.
As Obama said, "Let's see where
else we can make progress together.
Let's make this a year of action."

nothing Congress" passed 906. In

deed, three-fourths of Americans
agree with the "do-nothing label," a
CNN poll demonstrates.
Even still, Republicans are trim
ming back their agenda. This com
plies with the GOP campaign slogan
that since any government is bad
government, fewer laws ensure a
freer America.
Thus, President Obama pledged
to do more on his own: "America
does not stand still and neither
will I. So wherever and whenever I
can take steps without legisla
tion to expand opportunity for
more American families, that's
what I'm going to do."
For example, Vice President
Biden was asked to review the na
tion's job-training programs and of
fer a set of recommendations for
improvement. Obama added: "And
if Congress wants to help, you can
concentrate funding on proven pro
grams that connect more ready-to
work Americans with ready-to-be
filled jobs."
In another instance, he told
"every mayor, governor and state
legislator in America" not to "wait
for Congress to act" on the mini
mum wage. Going further, he com
mitted to issuing an executive order
to increase federal employees' min
imum wage from $7.25 to $lO.lO.
Even that promise was a throw
back: increasing the minimum wage
was a policy laid out in the 2013
State of the Union.
The frequent promises of execu
tive orders or executive action led
some to label him a tyrant, or in the
case of one Republican congress
man, a "socialist dictator." However,
this simply is not supported by the
facts. Obama issues executive or
ders at a rate of 0.09 per day, which
is the lowest rate since Grover
Cleveland was president.
In the end, this State of the
Union seemed less substantive than
past addresses. However, I argue
that Obama's promise to take inde
pendent action on proposals he's al
ready offered to Congress actually
makes his speech more meaningful
and suggests that 2014 could be
more productive. Now we must
hope that a hostile Republican
House of Representatives will seek
influence by cooperating rather
than watch its power disappear to
an active executive.
As Obama said, "Let's see where
else we can make progress together.
Let's make this a year of action."

Congress: Act Now was the
clear message of President
Obama's State of the Union
last Tuesday. It came with the corol
lary: If you don't, I will.
This scorn deviated from Oba
ma's typical style. Each of the Pres
ident's five previous SOTU ad
dresses was in response to a specif
ic event and focused on the associat
ed issue. In 2013, he called for gun
control legislation after the tragedy
at Sandy Hook. In 2012, he laid out
his reelection campaign platform;
one year earlier, he reacted to the
rise of the Tea Party the previous
November. And in his first, the new
President responded to a shrinking
economy and the fiscal collapse.
While 2013 was replete was sim
ilar events, perhaps the most signif
icant political event of that kind was
the government shutdown. Howev
er, in responding to the shutdown,
the President focused less on budg
etary policy and more on the poli
tics.
More than any other event, the
shutdown represented a Washing
ton that is literally paralyzed by
polarization. In fact, the shutdown
is only the ugly face of the actual is
sue at hand: gridlock. This affects
much more than budgetary politics
indeed, it has slowed nearly
every single item on the President's
six State of the Union agendas.
In focusing on gridlock rather

than advancing a new legislative
agenda, Obama not only recapped
the many challenges our country
faces, but also reminded Congress
that it has the power to (help) solve
them. Just three minutes into his
address, he declared: "The question
for everyone in this chamber, run
ning through every decision we
make this year, is whether we are
going to help or hinder this
progress."
Thus, in many ways, the policies
proposed were rehashed from pre
vious speeches. This was made ex
plicit frequently. "Last year, I asked
this Congress to help states make
high-quality pre-K available to
every four-year-old. As a parent as
well as a President, I repeat that re
quest tonight," Obama stated.
Likewise, on issues like unem
ployment insurance and transporta
tion, he reprimanded Congress and
especially the GOP-controlled
House for its inaction. On one of the
most prominent of these issues, the
President said: "Fix our broken im
migration system. Republicans and
Democrats in the Senate have act
ed. I know that members of both
parties in the House want to do the
same."
Yet, it took a year longer for the
House to release its immigration re
form plan, compared to the Senate.
If and when action will be taken re
mains unclear.
Going in a different direction,
President Obama rightly asked the
House of Representatives to stop
wasting days in session with mean
ingless votes to repeal the Afford
able Care Act. He added: "The first
forty were plenty. We got it. We all
owe it to the American people to say
what we're for, not just what we're
against."
This is emblematic of our do
nothing Congress. It passed only 56
laws in 2013, according to the LA
Times. Even Harry Truman's "do
nothing Congress" passed 906. In

deed, three-fourths of Americans
agree with the "do-nothing label," a
CNN poll demonstrates.
