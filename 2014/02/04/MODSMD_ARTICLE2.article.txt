# SPEAKERS & EVENTS
## "Cheers" writer on comedy Cheri Steinkellner won three Golden Globes, four Emmys 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Cheri SteinkeUner, winner of four
Emmys and three Golden Globes,
spoke at Meyer Library on Monday
evening, discussing her experiences as
the writer for the sitcom "Cheers" as
well as the intricacies of writing for tel
evision and her life and career as a
writer.
The event was put on by Tom
Kealey, a lecturer in the Creative Writ
ing Program, who framed his invita
tion to SteinkeUner as an opportunity
to students to come into contact with
an enthusiastic and knowledgeable
raconteur.
"Quite frankly, we want people who
are good storytellers, who can enter
tain and who are very approachable,"
Kealey said.
SteinkeUner began her story by ad
mitting that her career was not with
out obstacles.
"In late 1985, in the space of one
week, we [she and her husband] lost
our jobs, found out I was pregnant and
we didn't know how we would pay for
that house or that baby," SteinkeUner
said.
The couple would write "spec"
scripts, meaning they wrote specula
tively without an assignment or pay.
"We would write an episode of an
existing show and send it out to pro
ducers," she said. "After three years,
we were invited to come in and pitch
stories for 'The Jeffersons.' And we
ended up making five of six stories in
one of the seasons."
After the show ended, SteinkeUner
decided to take on the position of
writer for "Cheers." She noted that
"Cheers" was designed to play like a
play on a single-unit set, where the di
alogue was heavy and the character
voices very distinct.
"It was a joy for winters to be able
to work on this show," SteinkeUner
said. "We could play at the top of our
game and be as smart as we could be.
We had to learn in order to know how
to talk in the voice of our various char
acters. We were trying to cover all
comic possibilities."
During her talk, SteinkeUner also
described the three different stages
that a person goes through
when writing and producing:
the preproduction stage, in
which stories are being writ
ten or edited; the on-the
stage show of that week; and
finally post-production in
which episodes are edited
and prepared to go on air.
"The writing process
works a number of different
ways," Steinkellner said.
"Generally the writers will
get together a couple of
months before the actors
come in. We will design an
arc for the entire season and
start breaking stories."
Steinkellner also men
tioned that she believed one
of the greatest gifts in writ
ing sitcom is learning to
write fast and economically.
"I do like zooming
through a first draft so that
you can get all the way to the
end because often you get to
the end and it changes at the
beginning," she said. "But,
you can't know that until you

get to the end. Keeping that
perspective that none of this
is that precious and that it
can't be changed is really
helpful."
Over 20 students attend
ed the event, emerging
largely appreciative of the
experience. Lyric McHenry
'l4 was one of those highly
satisfied with Steinkellner's
presentation.
"She's one of the best
speakers I've heard in a long
time," McHenry said. "She
was really engaging and re
ally succinct, which is proba
bly due to the fact that she's
a really good writer. She was
funny, engaging and enter
taining all at the same time."
