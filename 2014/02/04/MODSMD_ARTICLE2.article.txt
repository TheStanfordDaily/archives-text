### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Cheri SteinkeUner, winner of four
Emmys and three Golden Globes,
spoke at Meyer Library on Monday
evening, discussing her experiences as
the writer for the sitcom "Cheers" as
well as the intricacies of writing for tel
evision and her life and career as a
writer.
The event was put on by Tom
Kealey, a lecturer in the Creative Writ
ing Program, who framed his invita
tion to SteinkeUner as an opportunity
to students to come into contact with
an enthusiastic and knowledgeable
raconteur.
"Quite frankly, we want people who
are good storytellers, who can enter
tain and who are very approachable,"
Kealey said.
SteinkeUner began her story by ad
mitting that her career was not with
out obstacles.
"In late 1985, in the space of one
week, we [she and her husband] lost
our jobs, found out I was pregnant and
we didn't know how we would pay for
that house or that baby," SteinkeUner
said.
The couple would write "spec"
scripts, meaning they wrote specula
tively without an assignment or pay.
"We would write an episode of an
existing show and send it out to pro
ducers," she said. "After three years,
we were invited to come in and pitch
stories for 'The Jeffersons.' And we
ended up making five of six stories in
one of the seasons."
After the show ended, SteinkeUner
decided to take on the position of
writer for "Cheers." She noted that
"Cheers" was designed to play like a
play on a single-unit set, where the di
alogue was heavy and the character
voices very distinct.
"It was a joy for winters to be able
to work on this show," SteinkeUner
said. "We could play at the top of our
game and be as smart as we could be.
We had to learn in order to know how
to talk in the voice of our various char
acters. We were trying to cover all
comic possibilities."
During her talk, SteinkeUner also
described the three different stages
