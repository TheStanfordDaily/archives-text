# SNOWCHELLA 2014
## Annual benefit concert raises more than $5,000 for charity 
### IRENE HSU DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Sigma Nu and Kappa Kappa
Gamma co-hosted the fifth annual
Snowchella benefit concert on Feb.
1, raising more than $5,000 to as
sist HIV/AIDS charity Support for
International Change (SIC).
This year's concert featured
performances by German elec
tronic music duo Digitalism, stu
dent musician Wiley Webb 'l6 and
eight-piece student band Paper
Void. Over 1,000 students attended
the event.

Snowchella's SIC roots
Snowchella's relationship with
SIC a Stanford-funded organi
zation dedicated to promoting

global health, especially in terms
of HIV/AIDS issues in Tanzania
has been sustained since the inau
gural concert in 2010, which was
created by former Sigma Nu com
munity chair Taylor Ray 'lO after
he spent two summers volunteer
ing for SIC in Tanzania..
"I really wanted to make com
munity service and philanthropy
more accessible to a college audi
ence," Ray said. "There weren't
many ways of combining the
worlds of doing good and having
fun at Stanford then."
The event's growing stature as
a campus tradition has led to a
smoother planning process, larger
budgets and attendance and more
prominent performers, according
to Snowchella Chair and Kappa

member Hannah Welch 'l6 and
Snowchella Producer and Sigma
Nu President James Honsa 'l4.
Welch and Honsa both noted, how
ever, that the linkage between
Snowchella and SIC despite an
announcement made at the con
cert's start that noted that pro
ceeds would go directly to SIC
has been somewhat overlooked.
"The fundraising element is
still disconnected from the concert
element," Honsa said. "It's the fi
nal piece of the puzzle that we
haven't been able to fit in."
Vita Salvioni Guttmann 'l7, an
event attendee, had no idea that
Snowchella was held to benefit
SIC, instead viewing it as more of
a typical fraternity party.
"[Snowchella] definitely exceed-

Ed my expectations," Salvioni
Guttmann said. "I thought it would
have a more fratty vibe than it ac
tually had, and it was nice that the
importance was more on the music
than on the grinding. I also liked
the concert setting, how people
have a direction and face the
stage."
The profits from the concert
are still being counted, but Honsa
said that they will definitely ex
ceed $5,000, producing a similar
result to recent years.
"Our main vision for Snowchel
la is making it the biggest music
event of the winter quarter," Hon
sa said. "We found a model that
works for this vision, and the scale

is the biggest we can go
while still keeping it on [Sig
ma Nu's] front lawn. Our
biggest push is to find ways
to expand the fundraising
model."
Funding for Snowchella
totaled around $15,000,
sourced principally from
Sigma Nu and Kappa as well
as from grants from the AS
SU, Stanford Concert Net
work and the Office of Alco
hol Education. Sigma Nu
and Kappa worked closely
with the latter two organiza
tions to put on the event.
The proceeds that go to
SIC come mainly from dona
tions from Kappa and Sigma
Nu members as well as their
friends and families. During
the concert, sorority and fra
ternity members also sold T
shirts and ice cream sand
wiches from Cream, which
agreed to donate 20 percent
of the profits to the cause.
This year also marked
the discontinuation of previ
ous fundraising efforts, such
as the inclusion of food
trucks at the event and the
implementation of text-to
donate campaigns. In the fu
ture, however, Welch and
other organizers said they
would consider putting up a
screen at the event that dis
plays the text donations live.
"Snowchella is about
raising money and aware
ness for a great organiza
tion," Ray said. "It's impor
tant to secure a baseline
amount for the fundraising
upfront, but we must never
lose sight of the fact that it's
about so much more
about building awareness,
about recruiting really great
and energetic volunteers."

about so much more
about building awareness,
about recruiting really great

Sigma Nu and Kappa Kappa
Gamma co-hosted the fifth annual
Snowchella benefit concert on Feb.
1, raising more than $5,000 to as
sist HIV/AIDS charity Support for
International Change (SIC).
This year's concert featured
performances by German elec
tronic music duo Digitalism, stu
dent musician Wiley Webb 'l6 and
eight-piece student band Paper
Void. Over 1,000 students attended
the event.

Snowchella's SIC roots
Snowchella's relationship with
SIC a Stanford-funded organi
zation dedicated to promoting

global health, especially in terms
of HIV/AIDS issues in Tanzania
has been sustained since the inau
gural concert in 2010, which was
created by former Sigma Nu com
munity chair Taylor Ray 'lO after
he spent two summers volunteer
ing for SIC in Tanzania..
"I really wanted to make com
munity service and philanthropy
more accessible to a college audi
ence," Ray said. "There weren't
many ways of combining the
worlds of doing good and having
fun at Stanford then."
The event's growing stature as
a campus tradition has led to a
smoother planning process, larger
budgets and attendance and more
prominent performers, according
to Snowchella Chair and Kappa

member Hannah Welch 'l6 and
Snowchella Producer and Sigma
Nu President James Honsa 'l4.
Welch and Honsa both noted, how
ever, that the linkage between
Snowchella and SIC despite an
announcement made at the con
cert's start that noted that pro
ceeds would go directly to SIC
has been somewhat overlooked.
"The fundraising element is
still disconnected from the concert
element," Honsa said. "It's the fi
nal piece of the puzzle that we
haven't been able to fit in."
Vita Salvioni Guttmann 'l7, an
event attendee, had no idea that
Snowchella was held to benefit
SIC, instead viewing it as more of
a typical fraternity party.
"[Snowchella] definitely exceed-

Ed my expectations," Salvioni
Guttmann said. "I thought it would
have a more fratty vibe than it ac
tually had, and it was nice that the
importance was more on the music
than on the grinding. I also liked
the concert setting, how people
have a direction and face the
stage."
The profits from the concert
are still being counted, but Honsa
said that they will definitely ex
ceed $5,000, producing a similar
result to recent years.
"Our main vision for Snowchel
la is making it the biggest music
event of the winter quarter," Hon
sa said. "We found a model that
works for this vision, and the scale

is the biggest we can go
while still keeping it on [Sig
ma Nu's] front lawn. Our
biggest push is to find ways
to expand the fundraising
model."
Funding for Snowchella
totaled around $15,000,
sourced principally from
Sigma Nu and Kappa as well
as from grants from the AS
SU, Stanford Concert Net
work and the Office of Alco
hol Education. Sigma Nu
and Kappa worked closely
with the latter two organiza
tions to put on the event.
The proceeds that go to
SIC come mainly from dona
tions from Kappa and Sigma
Nu members as well as their
friends and families. During
the concert, sorority and fra
ternity members also sold T
shirts and ice cream sand
wiches from Cream, which
agreed to donate 20 percent
of the profits to the cause.
This year also marked
the discontinuation of previ
ous fundraising efforts, such
as the inclusion of food
trucks at the event and the
implementation of text-to
donate campaigns. In the fu
ture, however, Welch and
other organizers said they
would consider putting up a
screen at the event that dis
plays the text donations live.
"Snowchella is about

tant to secure a baseline
