## Annual benefit concert raises more than $5,000 for charity

Sigma Nu and Kappa Kappa
Gamma co-hosted the fifth annual
Snowchella benefit concert on Feb.
1, raising more than $5,000 to as
sist HIV/AIDS charity Support for
International Change (SIC).
This year's concert featured
performances by German elec
tronic music duo Digitalism, stu
dent musician Wiley Webb 'l6 and
eight-piece student band Paper
Void. Over 1,000 students attended
the event.

Snowchella's SIC roots
Snowchella's relationship with
SIC a Stanford-funded organi
zation dedicated to promoting

global health, especially in terms
of HIV/AIDS issues in Tanzania
has been sustained since the inau
gural concert in 2010, which was
created by former Sigma Nu com
munity chair Taylor Ray 'lO after
he spent two summers volunteer
ing for SIC in Tanzania..
"I really wanted to make com
munity service and philanthropy
more accessible to a college audi
ence," Ray said. "There weren't
many ways of combining the
worlds of doing good and having
fun at Stanford then."
The event's growing stature as
a campus tradition has led to a
smoother planning process, larger
budgets and attendance and more
prominent performers, according
to Snowchella Chair and Kappa

member Hannah Welch 'l6 and
Snowchella Producer and Sigma
Nu President James Honsa 'l4.
Welch and Honsa both noted, how
ever, that the linkage between
Snowchella and SIC despite an
announcement made at the con
cert's start that noted that pro
ceeds would go directly to SIC
has been somewhat overlooked.
"The fundraising element is
still disconnected from the concert
element," Honsa said. "It's the fi
nal piece of the puzzle that we
haven't been able to fit in."
Vita Salvioni Guttmann 'l7, an
event attendee, had no idea that
Snowchella was held to benefit
SIC, instead viewing it as more of
a typical fraternity party.
"[Snowchella] definitely exceed-

Ed my expectations," Salvioni
Guttmann said. "I thought it would
have a more fratty vibe than it ac
tually had, and it was nice that the
importance was more on the music
than on the grinding. I also liked
the concert setting, how people
have a direction and face the
stage."
The profits from the concert
are still being counted, but Honsa
said that they will definitely ex
ceed $5,000, producing a similar
result to recent years.
"Our main vision for Snowchel
la is making it the biggest music
event of the winter quarter," Hon
sa said. "We found a model that
works for this vision, and the scale
