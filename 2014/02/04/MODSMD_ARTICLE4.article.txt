# O&A GENE SYKES
## NEWEST MEMBER OF THE STANFORD UNIVERSITY BOARD OF TRUSTEES 
### NITISH KULKARNI DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Gene Sykes MBA 'B4 is an investment
banker at Goldman Sachs and the newest
member of the Stanford University Board
of Trustees, having begun his five-year term
on Feb. 1. The Daily sat down with Sykes to
discuss his new role, his expectations and
his goals for the future.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How does it
feel to join the Board of Trustees and how
did it come about?
Gene Sykes (GS): I went to Harvard as
an undergraduate, then came to Stanford
for [the Graduate School of Business], and I
finished in 1984, and I had a fantastic time
at business school. It was a great experi
ence, I made really close friends, and I al
ways thought of it as one of the formative
experiences of my life.
It didn't take very long before I realized
that Stanford was so much easier to engage
with, and there were so many things you
could do at Stanford with people who actual
ly had influence. There was so much inter
est in... people who'd been to school here
and had lived their lives using the things
they'd learned here, the relationships
they'd developed and [how they had] used
their experience ... to guide the things they
did in their lives [and then] to come back
and participate with the University.

TSD: How did the process of joining the
Board take form?
GS: Over the past few months, a few peo
ple on the Board had approached me and
said, "We'd love to have you consider this."
At first, it was a great honor number one
—just to be considered to do this. The insti
tution is a fantastic place, and it was some
what intimidating, because you think about
the amount of time and effort and energy
that you give to something like this if you're
serious about it. I think that the expectation
for trustees of the University is that they
are really deeply engaged, and [that] they
take a lot of responsibilities. So, I had to
consider that and think about how much I
had to free up other things I was doing to
give myself enough time so I could give the
right kind of commitment.
TSD: What does being a trustee mean to
you?
GS: I am going to another level of attach
ment and responsibility for the institution
and [becoming] more educated about it,
better informed and taking the responsibili
ty to make sure that it operates to exploit all
of its advantages and be secure and contin
ue to be as effective and strong as it has
been in the past.

TSD: Where would you like to see the Uni
versity go in the next five years?
GS: An obligation for a trustee of an in

stitution like Stanford is to think pretty
deeply about, "What should the institution
do to live up to that responsibility?" It's
enormously well-endowed by lots of people,
and [it's] a franchise, really, with students of
the highest potential in the world. It's why
over 40,000 students apply to come to school
here as undergraduates, [and why] the qual
ity of the graduate students is exceedingly
high and when you have that many really
talented people around one place, you want
to get the most out of it. Being a trustee, to
my standpoint, is trying to understand that
and have as much constructive influence to
enhance it as possible.
