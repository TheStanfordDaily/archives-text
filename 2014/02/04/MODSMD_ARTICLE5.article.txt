## Genetic basis for allergies discovered 
### ISSA YOUSIF 
Researchers at the School of Medicine's
Nadeau Lab and the Lucile Packard Chil
dren's Hospital have found that peanut-al
lergic patients who have undergone desensi
tization treatment have altered DNA
methylation levels, offering the potential to
use those levels as markers for patients un
dergoing other allergy therapies.
Holden Maecker Ph.D. 'BB ED. 'BB ED.
'94, director of the Human Immune Moni
toring Center and a co-author of the paper,
explained that the fraction of children who
have peanut allergies has risen over time.
"Some of them have a severe peanut al
lergy, and it's life threatening for them,"
Maecker said. "It's an emerging medical
problem."
Similar to other food allergies, peanut al
lergies currently have no cure. Desensitiza
tion a method of treatment under which
patients are given increasing doses of
peanut powder every day over a two-year
period has allowed patients to tolerate
higher amounts of peanut after 24 months,
but the extent to which continued treatment
is necessary remains uncertain.
"One thing people ask when they finish
the study is, 'Does this mean I
have to take peanut butter at
four grams a day every day
for the rest of my life?"' said
Kari Nadeau, associate pro
fessor of pediatrics, immunol
ogy and allergy and the pa
per's senior author.

The researchers studied
patients who had ingested
peanut powder daily for 24
months, measuring their re
actions to peanuts three
months after the treatment
concluded. Of the 20 patients
who completed the program,
seven were no longer reactive
and were deemed "tolerant."
The remaining thirteen were
reactive only to higher levels
of peanut than patients who
had not gone through desen
sitization.
Researchers studied the
blood samples of the more tol
erant patients and found that
the DNA of their regulatory
T cells cells known to sup
press immune response
had fewer methyl groups at
tached to them. This change
in methylation was located at
a gene called FOXP3, which
plays a role in allergic re
sponses.
Researchers plan to next
undertake a larger phase-two
study involving about 120
people. By looking at differ
ent combinations of gene
markers and cells, they hope

to find a composite indicator
that may predict the effec
tiveness of immunotherapy in
a patient.
"In the new studies that
we're starting... we're going
to look for the same thing, but
we're also going to look for
other changes that accompa
ny it," Maecker said. "There's
certainly the possibility that,
in different people, tolerance
[to peanuts] is induced by dif
ferent mechanisms."
