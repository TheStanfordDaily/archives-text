## Genetic basis for allergies discovered 
### ISSA YOUSIF 
Researchers at the School of Medicine's
Nadeau Lab and the Lucile Packard Chil
dren's Hospital have found that peanut-al
lergic patients who have undergone desensi
tization treatment have altered DNA
methylation levels, offering the potential to
use those levels as markers for patients un
dergoing other allergy therapies.
Holden Maecker Ph.D. 'BB ED. 'BB ED.
'94, director of the Human Immune Moni
toring Center and a co-author of the paper,
explained that the fraction of children who
have peanut allergies has risen over time.
"Some of them have a severe peanut al
lergy, and it's life threatening for them,"
Maecker said. "It's an emerging medical
problem."
Similar to other food allergies, peanut al
lergies currently have no cure. Desensitiza
tion a method of treatment under which
patients are given increasing doses of
peanut powder every day over a two-year
period has allowed patients to tolerate
higher amounts of peanut after 24 months,
but the extent to which continued treatment
is necessary remains uncertain.
