## The 						power of motivation and self-belief 
### Ashley Westhem 
I don't think that this year's
Super Bowl warrants much
more attention than the col
umn that was written yester
day, so instead, I'm going to
quietly sidestep that typically mo
mentous sporting event and move
on to something else entirely.
I actually didn't watch the Super
Bowl because, by the time I got
back from the Stanford women's
basketball game in Berkeley, the
winner had already been decided
and I had missed the halftime show
so not really worth it for some
one who prefers college football
anyways.
Instead, I want to talk about an
inspiring story that I heard from
women's basketball head coach
Tara VanDerveer on the team bus
heading back from the game (I
broadcast them games for KZSU).
The team got to meet one of the
players that Tara coached for Team
USA during the 1996 Olympics.
The story of Ruthie Bolton is
one of perseverance and resilience
that can resonate with fans of all
sports and with any of you who were
told that you couldn't or wouldn't
succeed somewhere along the line.
This is the story that I got to hear
straight from Ruthie and Tara
themselves mixed with a little re
search of my own because I was cu
rious to find out more about this
player that Tara admires greatly.
Ruthie is one of 20 siblings from
McClain, Mississippi. She played
basketball in high school with her
older sister, Mae Ola Bolton, and
was only recruited to play at
Auburn University as part of a
package deal with her sister. She sat
down at Denny's with the coach and
was told that she probably wouldn't
get to see any action or be guaran
teed a scholarship or even a spot on
the team, so he offered to find her
another place to play or suggested
that she might want to play at a jun
ior college.
Ruthie decided to stick it out and
train harder than ever and actually
ended up not only making the team,
but starting during her freshman
year at Auburn. She led the Tigers to
back-to-back national championship
appearances, averaging 8.9 points
per game. She still had to pay her
own way to her first USA Women's
Basketball Olympic Trials despite
her strong collegiate play. After com
ing back from a knee injury, she was
able to make it to the final round of
try outs for the 1992 team before be
ing the last player cut.
Ruthie came back with determi
nation and confidence and made the
1996 Olympic team, in which she
aided Tara in winning a gold medal
for Team USA. She started every
game in the Olympics, averaging
12.8 points per game and hit consec
utive 3-point shots late in the gold
medal game to snatch the victory
away from Russia. She also won an
other gold medal with the 2000
United States basketball team.
The Olympics star then went on
to join the Monarchs in the WNBA's
fledgling years and in 1997 was
named the league's first Player of
the Week. After that season, she fin
ished as the second-leading scorer
in the WNBA and made the All-
League first team.
Now, though, she needed her re
silience and perseverance yet again
as she tore her ACL and lost her fa
ther. She overcame the hardships
and came back for the 1999-2000
season, during which she averaged
13 points per game, returning just
in time to be a defensive beast in the
2000 Olympics as well.
Finishing her career with two
NCAA National Championship ap
pearances, two Olympic gold
medals and eight years in the WN
BA, you would never have thought
that Ruthie was told by her future
coach at Auburn that she wasn't
good enough to play there and was
less desirable than her older sister.
Sometimes, it's that added shove in
to the ground that motivates you
even more to not only stand up, but
to soar above the opposition to
prove to yourself that you are good
enough. This is something to re
member in life and in sports.
I am so lucky that I get to be a
small part of Stanford women's bas
ketball and to hear great stories like
this one from one of the most cele
brated coaches in the game of col
lege basketball and beyond.
