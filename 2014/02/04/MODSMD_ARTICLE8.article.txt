# STANFORD IN THE NFL
## SUPER SEAHAWKS SHERMAN, BALDWIN CAPTURE SUPER BOWL TITLE 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN DESK EDITOR 
As he mentioned in an interview with The Dai
ly earlier this season, former Cardinal wide re
ceiver Doug Baldwin 'll decided, in large part, to
sign with the Seattle Seahawks as an undrafted
free agent due to the influence of his close friend,
Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman 'lO.
On Sunday in Super Bowl XLVIII, the reunion
of Sherman and Baldwin in the NFL reached its
pinnacle as both contributed heavily in the Sea
hawks' 43-8 rout of the Denver Broncos to clinch
both players' first Super Bowl title.
Continuing his torrid run throughout the play
offs, Baldwin led all Seattle receivers with five re
ceptions for 66 yards, including a 10-yard touch
down reception in the fourth quarter. As he has
done throughout his NFL career, Baldwin made

the most of every opportunity that came his way
by converting every time he was targeted. In ad
dition, all five of Baldwin's receptions, including
his touchdown catch, came on scoring drives and
played crucial parts in the blowout win.
Sherman, on the other side of the ball, had a
relatively quiet night statistically as he was
rarely targeted by Broncos quarterback Peyton
Manning. In particular, Sherman helped limit
Broncos wide receiver Eric Decker, whom he
covered for most of the game, to just one catch
for 6 yards. Overall, Sherman finished with
three tackles and one pass deflection before he
was carted off the field after suffering an ankle
injury in the fourth quarter.

The Broncos' defeat, tied for the third-largest
loss in Super Bowl history, also created one of
the most intriguing storylines of the night. Cur

rent Broncos executive vice president of football
operations and former Stanford and Denver
quarterback John Elway 'B3 also took part in the
biggest Super Bowl blowout of all time, a 55-10
slaughtering at the hands of the San Francisco
49ers in Super Bowl XXIV As he did in his play
ing career, Elway will now look to rebound from
the crushing defeat and have his team prepared
for success in future Super Bowls.
The Cardinal was also represented on the
Broncos' sideline in Super Bowl XLVIII by de
fensive tackle Sione Fua 'll.

Apart from the Stanford alums directly in
volved in the grandest spectacle in American
sports, several others were involved with cover
ing the game in the media.
