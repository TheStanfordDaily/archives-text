### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
The fourth-ranked women's

taking down No. 17 UCLA 180-120
on Friday and No. 5 USC 170-130
on Saturday to improve to 9-0 in
dual meets.
In Friday's televised meet, the
Cardinal swam to victory thanks to
the performances of senior Felicia
Lee, senior Andie Taylor and junior
Katie Olsen, who each won two or
more events during the meet.

Taylor captured the two dis
tance events with a time of 9:50.44
in the 1000-yard freestyle and a
time of 4:50.62 in the 500-yard
freestyle. She finished three sec
onds faster than any other competi
tor in her victory in the latter race.
"It's just about executing the
race plan," said Taylor to GoStan
ford.com. "I think I swam pretty
well. I felt like I was able to have
something at the end to finish off,
so I'm happy with it."
Lee dominated the shorter-dis
tance swims, winning the 100-yard
backstroke with a time of 53.35,
the 200-yard backstroke with a
time of 1:56.75 and 200-yard indi
vidual medley (IM) with a time of
2:00.42. She also swam a strong
butterfly leg in the Cardinal's vic
torious effort in the 200-yard med
ley relay.

Olsen again won both the 100-
yard breaststroke and the 200-
yard breaststroke for her third
straight meet with times of 1:01.19
and 2:12.61, respectively.
Stanford fielded a young group
for the 400-yard freestyle relay,
with freshman Lia Neal, sopho
more Julia Ama, sophomore Julia

Anderson and junior Maddy
Schaefer. The team won the relay
by only seven-hundredths of a sec
ond to end the meet in dramatic
fashion for the Cardinal.
With the victory, Stanford now
possesses an all-time record of 30-3
against UCLA.

meet between two of the country's

"Having four meets in
nine days certainly presents
some challenges," said head
coach Greg Meehan to

pleased with the intensity
with which we raced at all
four meets no matter what
the score was."

200-yard butterfly and the

200-yard backstroke with
times of 1:57.98 and 1:56.98,
