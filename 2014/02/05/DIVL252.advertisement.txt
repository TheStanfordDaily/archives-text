Morally Permissible: The Killing of Osama bin Laden
â€”Revenge, Assassination, or Justified Defense?
Thursday, February 6

Free and open to public
Was the killing of Osama bin Laden morally permissible?
Many people, including the President of the United States,
say "yes," and "justice was done." Others claim that it was
an unjustifiable act of vengeance, analogous to a Mafia
style "hit."Once the moral questions surrounding the killing
are examined with proper philosophical scrutiny, however,
we find that the matter is more complex and nuanced than
it may at first appear.
Employing a rights-based liability account of justified
defensive killing, Bradley Strawser, Assistant Professor
of the Department of Defense Analysis, US Naval
Postgraduate School, mounts an ethical argument that
aims to address concerns raised by all the conflicting
positions above. His conclusion is nuanced, complex,
morally discriminating, and will be of interest to everyone
who witnessed this event and pondered its meaning.
