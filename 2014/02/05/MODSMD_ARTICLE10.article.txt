# CALIFORNIA CLASH
## CARDINAL LOOKS FOR STATEMENT WIN AT CAL 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
Recent performances by
the Stanford men's basketball
team have provided a basis
for cautious optimism
amongst Cardinal faithful and
a possible winning blueprint
moving forward. Was the
near-miss performance
against No. 1 Arizona a sign of
good things to come? Does
dispatching Arizona State, an
other hungry bubble team,
mean the Cardinal has turned
the corner? Is the stingy de
fense and physical rebound
ing sustainable?
A win today over archrival
Cal (15-7, 6-3 Pac-12) would
provide some more evidence
in the affirmative, and in turn,
create a few more believers
out of the legion of naysayers.
More importantly, Stanford's
(14-7, 5-4) NCAA tournament
resume could certainly use
the boost.
The Cardinal will travel to
Berkeley tonight in an at
tempt to exact revenge on its
archrivals after having suf
fered a 69-62 defeat at the
hands of the Bears on Jan. 2
at Maples Pavilion. Cal is also
riding high after having ac
complished what Stanford
could not: an upset of Arizona.
Behind the big-time play
of fifth-year senior point
guard Justin Cobbs, who hit
the game-winning jumper as
time wound down, the Bears
pulled off the stunner in a
game that had a lot of similar
ities to the one the Cardinal
had played against the Wild
cats just a few nights earlier.
It was a low-scoring, physical
battle down to the wire, but as

opposed to Stanford's offen
sive struggles down the
stretch, Cal made just enough
plays to come away with the
victory. Cobbs was particular
ly terrific, scoring 16 of his 19
points in the second half, in
cluding all 12 of the Bears'
points over the final 11:30 of
the game.
The last time Stanford and
Cal met, Cobbs was effective,
scoring 18 points and tallying
five assists in the Bears' victo
ry. Stanford will certainly fo
cus its defensive game plan on
stopping Cobbs, the key cog
in an otherwise balanced of
fensive attack. The Bears fea
ture four starters who aver
age double-digits in points,
much like the Cardinal. Un
like Stanford, however, Cal's
bench can pack a punch,
thanks to highly touted fresh
man Jabari Bird and senior
Ricky Kreklow. Neither
played the last time these two
squads met, meaning Stan
ford will have to deal with a
plethora of offensive weapons
that it didn't see the last time
out.
If the Cardinal bench can
step up and make some sub
stantial contributions similar
to those in each of Stanford's
two most recent victories,
things could be different this
time around. Cal's bench
outscored Stanford's 7-0 in
the earlier meeting between
the two teams this season, and
those seven points proved to
be the final difference in the
game.
"We're going to trust our
bench through the remainder
of the season, because they've

thing I've seen for us is that
they've defended for us
every night."

to be a close affair thanks to
the implications of the out
come for each team. The
winner emerges as a sure
fire contender for a top-four
finish in the Pac-12 as the
second half of the confer
ence season begins, while
the loser moves back to
wards the league's large
middle class.
Stanford will seek to con
trol the paint like it did
against Arizona and ASU. If
it can outrebound the Bears
and outscore them in the
paint, Stanford's chances for
victory will be greatly im
proved. Cal won the re
bounding battle the last
time out and scored more
second-chance points, two
factors that helped offset
Stanford's 30-20 advantage
on points scored in the
paint.
The Cardinal must do a
better job of capitalizing on
all of its scoring opportuni
ties. Blown layups cost
Stanford the win against
Arizona, and a 10-for-20 per
formance from the free
throw line against the Bears
the last time out was a huge
contributing factor, if not
the difference, in the final
outcome.
As always, the Cardinal
will look to its senior lead
ers, forwards Dwight Pow
ell and Josh Huestis, to set
the tone for this game and
convert the opportunities
Stanford is given. There is
reason to believe that the
duo will perform, consider
ing Powell is coming off of a
28-point outburst against
ASU, his best individual
performance of the season,
while Huestis averaged a
double-double in the two
games last week.
Tipoff tonight is at 6
p.m. in Berkeley, with the
game televised on ESPN2.

the tone for this game and
convert the opportunities
Stanford is given. There is
reason to believe that the
duo will perform, consider

28-point outburst against
ASU, his best individual
performance of the season,

double-double in the two
games last week.

Recent performances by
the Stanford men's basketball
team have provided a basis
for cautious optimism
amongst Cardinal faithful and
a possible winning blueprint
moving forward. Was the
near-miss performance
against No. 1 Arizona a sign of
good things to come? Does
dispatching Arizona State, an
other hungry bubble team,
mean the Cardinal has turned
the corner? Is the stingy de
fense and physical rebound
ing sustainable?
A win today over archrival
Cal (15-7, 6-3 Pac-12) would
provide some more evidence
in the affirmative, and in turn,
create a few more believers
out of the legion of naysayers.
More importantly, Stanford's
(14-7, 5-4) NCAA tournament
resume could certainly use
the boost.
The Cardinal will travel to
Berkeley tonight in an at
tempt to exact revenge on its
archrivals after having suf
fered a 69-62 defeat at the
hands of the Bears on Jan. 2
at Maples Pavilion. Cal is also
riding high after having ac
complished what Stanford
could not: an upset of Arizona.
Behind the big-time play
of fifth-year senior point
guard Justin Cobbs, who hit
the game-winning jumper as
time wound down, the Bears
pulled off the stunner in a
game that had a lot of similar
ities to the one the Cardinal
had played against the Wild
cats just a few nights earlier.
It was a low-scoring, physical
battle down to the wire, but as

opposed to Stanford's offen
sive struggles down the
stretch, Cal made just enough
plays to come away with the
victory. Cobbs was particular
ly terrific, scoring 16 of his 19
points in the second half, in
cluding all 12 of the Bears'
points over the final 11:30 of
the game.
The last time Stanford and
Cal met, Cobbs was effective,
scoring 18 points and tallying
five assists in the Bears' victo
ry. Stanford will certainly fo
cus its defensive game plan on
stopping Cobbs, the key cog
in an otherwise balanced of
fensive attack. The Bears fea
ture four starters who aver
age double-digits in points,
much like the Cardinal. Un
like Stanford, however, Cal's
bench can pack a punch,
thanks to highly touted fresh
man Jabari Bird and senior
Ricky Kreklow. Neither
played the last time these two
squads met, meaning Stan
ford will have to deal with a
plethora of offensive weapons
that it didn't see the last time
out.
If the Cardinal bench can
step up and make some sub
stantial contributions similar
to those in each of Stanford's
two most recent victories,
things could be different this
time around. Cal's bench
outscored Stanford's 7-0 in
the earlier meeting between
the two teams this season, and
those seven points proved to
be the final difference in the
game.
"We're going to trust our
bench through the remainder
of the season, because they've

the implications of the out

time out and scored more
second-chance points, two
factors that helped offset
Stanford's 30-20 advantage

The Cardinal must do a
better job of capitalizing on
all of its scoring opportuni

Stanford the win against
Arizona, and a 10-for-20 per

contributing factor, if not
