# CALIFORNIA CLASH
## CARDINAL LOOKS FOR STATEMENT WIN AT CAL 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
Recent performances by
the Stanford men's basketball
team have provided a basis
for cautious optimism
amongst Cardinal faithful and
a possible winning blueprint
moving forward. Was the
near-miss performance
against No. 1 Arizona a sign of
good things to come? Does
dispatching Arizona State, an
other hungry bubble team,
mean the Cardinal has turned
the corner? Is the stingy de
fense and physical rebound
ing sustainable?
A win today over archrival
Cal (15-7, 6-3 Pac-12) would
provide some more evidence
in the affirmative, and in turn,
create a few more believers
out of the legion of naysayers.
More importantly, Stanford's
(14-7, 5-4) NCAA tournament
resume could certainly use
the boost.
The Cardinal will travel to
Berkeley tonight in an at
tempt to exact revenge on its
archrivals after having suf
fered a 69-62 defeat at the
hands of the Bears on Jan. 2
at Maples Pavilion. Cal is also
riding high after having ac
complished what Stanford
could not: an upset of Arizona.
Behind the big-time play
of fifth-year senior point
guard Justin Cobbs, who hit
the game-winning jumper as
time wound down, the Bears
pulled off the stunner in a
game that had a lot of similar
ities to the one the Cardinal
had played against the Wild
cats just a few nights earlier.
It was a low-scoring, physical
battle down to the wire, but as

opposed to Stanford's offen
sive struggles down the
stretch, Cal made just enough
plays to come away with the
victory. Cobbs was particular
ly terrific, scoring 16 of his 19
points in the second half, in
cluding all 12 of the Bears'
points over the final 11:30 of
the game.
The last time Stanford and
Cal met, Cobbs was effective,
scoring 18 points and tallying
five assists in the Bears' victo
ry. Stanford will certainly fo
cus its defensive game plan on
stopping Cobbs, the key cog
in an otherwise balanced of
fensive attack. The Bears fea
ture four starters who aver
age double-digits in points,
much like the Cardinal. Un
like Stanford, however, Cal's
bench can pack a punch,
thanks to highly touted fresh
man Jabari Bird and senior
Ricky Kreklow. Neither
played the last time these two
squads met, meaning Stan
ford will have to deal with a
plethora of offensive weapons
that it didn't see the last time
out.
If the Cardinal bench can
step up and make some sub
stantial contributions similar
to those in each of Stanford's
two most recent victories,
things could be different this
time around. Cal's bench
outscored Stanford's 7-0 in
the earlier meeting between
the two teams this season, and
those seven points proved to
be the final difference in the
game.
"We're going to trust our
bench through the remainder
of the season, because they've

Senior forward Josh Huestis (right) is averaging 13 points and 8.8 rebounds
over his last six games. He'll look to carry the Cardinal to a victory against Cal,
which would put the team in prime position for a top-four conference finish.
