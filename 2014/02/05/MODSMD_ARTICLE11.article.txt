# HIATUS ENDS IN HAWAII
## 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
Offseasons for athletes have
their ups and downs. Sure, there's
the relaxation time, the opportuni
ty to pursue other endeavors and
improve on one's game. On the
other hand, extended time away
from competition can be boring
and tedious for an athlete. For the

No. 9 Stanford men's golf team,
the long wait between the fall and
spring seasons is finally over, as
the Card is scheduled to compete
at the Amer Ari Invitational in
Kona, Hawaii starting Thursday.
"We were excited about our
offseason, and our training is
something we've placed a lot of fo
cus on over the last month or two,"
said head coach Conrad Ray '97.

"The guys all had very productive
winter breaks, and the scores re
flected that in our qualifying
event. We shot some really solid
scores on some tough golf courses.
And the weather's been very co
operative in our prep, so that's
been nice."

solid play may not follow the
Cardinal across the Pacific.
While the temperatures are
forecasted to be in the low
eighties, there is a signifi
cant chance of rain through
out the week, which could af
fect the squad's preparation
time on the Waikoloa Kings'
Course. As with nearly all
golf tournaments on the Big
Island, wind will also play a
key role in the scoring, with
Ray calling it "always an un
predictable factor."
Senior Cameron Wilson
knows all too well the chal
lenges on the picturesque
Kings' Course. He has never
scored under par at the tour
nament in each of the last
three years. However, the
seasoned and confident vet
eran doesn't believe that he
has to adjust too much to be
successful this week.

"Last year, I played nice
ly, save for one to two bad
holes each day," Wilson said.

"My game plan [this week]
won't be any different but I
need to keep my concentra
tion better to avoid a few
slip-ups."

Wilson, who had a solid
offseason capped by a
fourth-place finish at the
prestigious Master of the
Amateurs event in Australia,
will be joined in Stanford's
five-man lineup by sopho
more David Boote, junior
Patrick Rodgers and fresh
men Maverick McNealy and
Viraat Badhwar. Boote will
play in the No. 1 slot this
week by virtue of his win at
the team's intrasquad quali
fying event a few weekends
ago in Monterrey, and the
sophomore from England
will certainly be looking to
improve upon his even-par
performance at Amer Ari
last year. Ray will also bring
along junior Patrick Grimes
and freshman Jim Liu to
play as individuals.
While the weather may
or may not give the Card a
break, the field will undoubt
edly not. No. 2 Georgia Tech
and No. 4 Oklahoma State
headline Stanford's oppo

nents, with No. 14 Washing
ton and No. 15 UCLA also
making appearances. The
20-team field also contains
eight Pac-12 schools, which
will give the Cardinal an ex
cellent feel for how it stacks
up within the conference.
"The field at the Amer
Ari is the strongest, if not
one of the strongest, events
we'll see all year," Ray said.
"We'll have to be on top of
our games."
Not only will this tourna
ment give Stanford a good
test against quality oppo
nents, it could be the spring
board the Cardinal needs for
a successful spring cam
paign.
"Starting the spring on
the right foot is huge," Wil
son said. "Winning in the
postseason will be tough un
less it becomes a habit and
we are used to being in con
tention. These next few tour
naments are perfect oppor
tunities to contend and make
it something we are used to
come springtime."

scored under par at the tour
nament in each of the last
three years. However, the
seasoned and confident vet
eran doesn't believe that he
has to adjust too much to be
successful this week.

"Last year, I played nice
ly, save for one to two bad
holes each day," Wilson said.

"My game plan [this week]
won't be any different but I
need to keep my concentra
tion better to avoid a few
slip-ups."

Wilson, who had a solid
offseason capped by a
fourth-place finish at the
prestigious Master of the
Amateurs event in Australia,
will be joined in Stanford's
five-man lineup by sopho
more David Boote, junior
Patrick Rodgers and fresh
men Maverick McNealy and
Viraat Badhwar. Boote will
play in the No. 1 slot this
week by virtue of his win at
the team's intrasquad quali
fying event a few weekends
ago in Monterrey, and the
sophomore from England
will certainly be looking to
improve upon his even-par
performance at Amer Ari
last year. Ray will also bring
along junior Patrick Grimes
and freshman Jim Liu to
play as individuals.
While the weather may
or may not give the Card a
break, the field will undoubt
edly not. No. 2 Georgia Tech
and No. 4 Oklahoma State
headline Stanford's oppo

nents, with No. 14 Washing
ton and No. 15 UCLA also
making appearances. The
20-team field also contains
eight Pac-12 schools, which
will give the Cardinal an ex
cellent feel for how it stacks
up within the conference.
"The field at the Amer
Ari is the strongest, if not
one of the strongest, events
we'll see all year," Ray said.
"We'll have to be on top of
our games."
Not only will this tourna
ment give Stanford a good
test against quality oppo
nents, it could be the spring
board the Cardinal needs for
a successful spring cam
paign.
"Starting the spring on
the right foot is huge," Wil
son said. "Winning in the
postseason will be tough un
less it becomes a habit and
we are used to being in con
tention. These next few tour
naments are perfect oppor
tunities to contend and make
it something we are used to
come springtime."
