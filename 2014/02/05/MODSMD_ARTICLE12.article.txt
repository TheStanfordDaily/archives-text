## Stanford suffers first defeat 
### NITISH KULKARNI DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Despite personal collegiate-best
showings for senior Kristina Vacu
lik on vault and for freshman Nico
lette McNair on bars, Stanford's
women's gymnastics team fell just
short of a win against defending
Pac-12 champion No. 16 Oregon
State (3-1,1-1 Pac-12) in Corvallis,
Ore., on Monday night. The No. 12
Cardinal (10-1,2-1), which suffered
its first loss of the season, had ear

ly gains in the meet, but was ulti
mately edged 197.100 to 195.750.

Stanford performed well ini
tially, with a start on bars that had
the first three gymnasts each
scoring 9.750 or higher, including
two scores of 9.875 from Vaculik
and McNair. However, a missed

routine and two falls by gymnasts
on the back end of the rotation al
lowed the Beavers to recover
from their deficit to take a 49.075-
48.500 lead.
"There were great individual
performances, but as a team we
came up short," Stanford head
coach Kristen Smyth told GoStan
ford.com. "We have to be able to
put a complete performance to
gether."

STANFORD 195.750
OREGON STATE 197.100
2/3, Corvatlis, Ore.
With strong performances
on vault by Vaculik and Mc-
Nair, who both posted scores
of 9.900, Stanford pulled closer
to Oregon State ahead of the
floor routines. Strong second
rotation floor performances
by freshman Rachel Daum,

Vaculik and junior Pauline
Hanset helped pull Stanford
closer with scores of 9.850,
9.925 and 9.700 respectively.
Vaculik's 9.925 matched her
previous collegiate best in the
event. This was offset, howev
er, by the first three gym
nasts on the floor, who each
scored 9.650 or lower.
Stanford started the final
rotation on the beam trailing
by 1.075, and although five
team members marked high

er than 9.775, Oregon State
scored a total of 49.475 in its
final rotation, edging past
Stanford's final rotation
score of 49.200.
The Cardinal will try to
bounce back from its first de
feat of the season on Satur
day, when it stays on the road
to take on No. 24 Washington
in Seattle at 4 p.m.
