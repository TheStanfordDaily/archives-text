## Stanford suffers first defeat 
### NITISH KULKARNI DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Despite personal collegiate-best
showings for senior Kristina Vacu
lik on vault and for freshman Nico
lette McNair on bars, Stanford's
women's gymnastics team fell just
short of a win against defending
Pac-12 champion No. 16 Oregon
State (3-1,1-1 Pac-12) in Corvallis,
Ore., on Monday night. The No. 12
Cardinal (10-1,2-1), which suffered
its first loss of the season, had ear

ly gains in the meet, but was ulti
mately edged 197.100 to 195.750.

Stanford performed well ini
tially, with a start on bars that had
the first three gymnasts each
scoring 9.750 or higher, including
two scores of 9.875 from Vaculik
and McNair. However, a missed

routine and two falls by gymnasts
on the back end of the rotation al
lowed the Beavers to recover
from their deficit to take a 49.075-
48.500 lead.
"There were great individual
performances, but as a team we
came up short," Stanford head
coach Kristen Smyth told GoStan
ford.com. "We have to be able to
put a complete performance to
gether."
