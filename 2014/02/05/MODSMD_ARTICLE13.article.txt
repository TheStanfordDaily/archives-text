## New faces ready for new year Pitching recruits highlight rotation 
### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With the calendar turning from
January to February, a new season
of Stanford softball has arrived on
The Farm. The No. 20/22 Cardinal
will attempt to build off of a suc
cessful 2013 campaign in which it
finished with a 39-21 overall record,

her high school senior season with a
16-4 record and a nearly unfath

Hoover hit .500 at the plate while
leading her high school to a South
Carolina state championship.
Schreyer, a Woodinville, Wash,
native, was Washington's Gatorade
Player of the Year in 2012, as she
capped her junior season with a
perfect 21-0 record and a paltry
0.28 ERA in leading Woodinville
High School to a state champi
onship.
In the field, the Cardinal will re
turn six starters from last year's
squad, including sophomore Kayla
Bonstrom, who was recently
