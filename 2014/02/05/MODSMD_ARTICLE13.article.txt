## New faces ready for new year Pitching recruits highlight rotation 
### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With the calendar turning from
January to February, a new season
of Stanford softball has arrived on
The Farm. The No. 20/22 Cardinal
will attempt to build off of a suc
cessful 2013 campaign in which it
finished with a 39-21 overall record,
Stanford's first winning mark in
Pac-12 play since 2009. While the
team aims to clinch its 17th consec
utive NCAA tournament berth, the
Card has its sights set on more
than just a trip to the regionals.
This year's team is filled with
young talent, as the Cardinal has
only two seniors on the roster: out
fielder Corey Hanewich and desig
nated player/catcher Danielle
Miller. In particular, the Card will
look to rely on its underclassmen in
the circle with the graduation of
star pitcher Teagan Gerhart.
Freshmen Carley Hoover and Madi
Schreyer, two members of Stan
ford's highly touted recruiting class
of 2013, will join junior Nyree
White in anchoring the pitching
staff this season.
Hoover, a Clemson, S.C. prod
uct, was the 2013 Gatorade Nation
al Player of the Year, as she finished
her high school senior season with a
16-4 record and a nearly unfath
omable 0.15 ERA. In addition,
Hoover hit .500 at the plate while
leading her high school to a South
Carolina state championship.
Schreyer, a Woodinville, Wash,
native, was Washington's Gatorade
Player of the Year in 2012, as she
capped her junior season with a
perfect 21-0 record and a paltry
0.28 ERA in leading Woodinville
High School to a state champi
onship.
In the field, the Cardinal will re
turn six starters from last year's
squad, including sophomore Kayla
Bonstrom, who was recently
named to USA Softball's Top
50 Watch List for the Nation
al Collegiate Player of the
Year award. Bonstrom, a Tuc
son, Ariz, native, earned the
distinction after a standout
freshman season, in which
she led the Card in each
triple slash category, in addi
tion to runs batted in (RBI).
In turn, Bonstrom was
named Pac-12 Freshman of
the Year and a Pac-12 First
Team All-Conference player.
Stanford will also lean on
contributions from its size
able junior class, as juniors
Hanna Winter, Leah White,
Cassandra Roulund and Erin
Ashby will all have big im
pacts again this year. Winter,
a Camarillo, Calif, product,
had another outstanding sea
son in 2013 after earning Pac
-12 First Team honors as a
freshman. She hit .346 with
19 RBIs while making some
tremendous plays on defense
at third base.
White, a 2013 NFCA All-
West Region Second Team
selection, will once again fig
ure to be an important con
tributor in the outfield for the
Card after a 2013 season that
saw her start 58 games in left
field while batting .324 and
driving in 27 runs. Roulund, a
Trabuco Canyon, Calif, na
tive, led the Pac-12 in triples
with six three-baggers while
blasting eight homers and
slugging .552, both good for
third on the team.
Finally, Ashby, who had
nine multi-RBI games and
six home runs last season,
will look to carry on her per
formance from the end of
2013. The La Crescenta,
Calif, native hit .333 in the
Lincoln Regional of the
NCAA tournament, which in
cluded a 2-for-4 day with two
RBl's against then-No. 16
Nebraska.
Stanford will play in its
first non-conference tourna
ment of the season this
Thursday through Sunday, as
the Cardinal heads to the Ari
zona desert to participate in
the Kajikawa Classic. The
Card's toughest game in this
tournament will perhaps be
its opener on Thursday night

against North Carolina State.
The Wolfpack, the defending
ACC Tournament Champi
ons, are currently sitting on
the fringe of the Top 25 in
both the USA Today/NFCA
Coaches Poll and the ES
PN/USA Softball Poll.
While in Tempe, Ariz.,
Stanford will also face two
Big Ten programs the
Northwestern Wildcats on

Friday and the Indiana
Hoosiers on Saturday. The
Cardinal and Hoosiers are
certainly familiar with each
other's programs, as the two
teams faced off twice last sea
son once in last year's Ka
jikawa Classic, an 8-2 victory
for Stanford. The Cardinal al
so knocked off Indiana in the
2013 Easton Invitational,
with the Card blanking the

Hoosiers 7-0 in Fullerton,
Calif.
The Cardinal also played
the Wildcats in last year's
Easton Invitational, with
Stanford coming out on top 5-
2. In total, Stanford owns an
11-6 record all-time against
Indiana and Northwestern.
Contests against San
Diego State, Western Michi
gan and Seattle round out the

Card's slate of games in
Tempe. Sunday's game be
tween Stanford and Seattle
will mark the first meeting
between the two programs,
while the Cardinal owns an
11-4 record all-time against
SDSU, as well as a 3-1 mark
against WMU.

named to USA Softball's Top
50 Watch List for the Nation
al Collegiate Player of the
Year award. Bonstrom, a Tuc
son, Ariz, native, earned the
distinction after a standout
freshman season, in which
she led the Card in each
triple slash category, in addi
tion to runs batted in (RBI).
In turn, Bonstrom was
named Pac-12 Freshman of
the Year and a Pac-12 First
Team All-Conference player.
Stanford will also lean on
contributions from its size
able junior class, as juniors
Hanna Winter, Leah White,
Cassandra Roulund and Erin
Ashby will all have big im
pacts again this year. Winter,
a Camarillo, Calif, product,
had another outstanding sea
son in 2013 after earning Pac
-12 First Team honors as a
freshman. She hit .346 with
19 RBIs while making some
tremendous plays on defense
at third base.
White, a 2013 NFCA All-
West Region Second Team
selection, will once again fig
ure to be an important con
tributor in the outfield for the
Card after a 2013 season that
saw her start 58 games in left
field while batting .324 and
driving in 27 runs. Roulund, a
Trabuco Canyon, Calif, na
tive, led the Pac-12 in triples
with six three-baggers while
blasting eight homers and
slugging .552, both good for
third on the team.
Finally, Ashby, who had
nine multi-RBI games and
six home runs last season,
will look to carry on her per
formance from the end of
2013. The La Crescenta,
Calif, native hit .333 in the
Lincoln Regional of the
NCAA tournament, which in
cluded a 2-for-4 day with two
RBl's against then-No. 16
Nebraska.
Stanford will play in its
first non-conference tourna
ment of the season this
Thursday through Sunday, as
the Cardinal heads to the Ari
zona desert to participate in
the Kajikawa Classic. The
Card's toughest game in this
tournament will perhaps be
its opener on Thursday night

against North Carolina State.
The Wolfpack, the defending
ACC Tournament Champi
ons, are currently sitting on
the fringe of the Top 25 in
both the USA Today/NFCA
Coaches Poll and the ES
PN/USA Softball Poll.
While in Tempe, Ariz.,
Stanford will also face two
Big Ten programs the
Northwestern Wildcats on

Friday and the Indiana
Hoosiers on Saturday. The
Cardinal and Hoosiers are
certainly familiar with each
other's programs, as the two
teams faced off twice last sea
son once in last year's Ka
jikawa Classic, an 8-2 victory
for Stanford. The Cardinal al
so knocked off Indiana in the
2013 Easton Invitational,
with the Card blanking the

Hoosiers 7-0 in Fullerton,
Calif.
The Cardinal also played
the Wildcats in last year's
Easton Invitational, with
Stanford coming out on top 5-
2. In total, Stanford owns an
11-6 record all-time against
Indiana and Northwestern.
Contests against San
Diego State, Western Michi
gan and Seattle round out the

Card's slate of games in
Tempe. Sunday's game be
tween Stanford and Seattle
will mark the first meeting
between the two programs,
while the Cardinal owns an
11-4 record all-time against
SDSU, as well as a 3-1 mark
against WMU.

Sophomore Kayla Bonstrom (above) was recently named to USA Softball's Watch List for the National Collegiate
Player of the Year award. Last season, her .404/.483/.643 triple-slash line and 55 RBI led all Cardinal players.
With the calendar turning from
January to February, a new season
of Stanford softball has arrived on
The Farm. The No. 20/22 Cardinal
will attempt to build off of a suc
cessful 2013 campaign in which it
finished with a 39-21 overall record,
Stanford's first winning mark in
Pac-12 play since 2009. While the
team aims to clinch its 17th consec
utive NCAA tournament berth, the
Card has its sights set on more
than just a trip to the regionals.
This year's team is filled with
young talent, as the Cardinal has
only two seniors on the roster: out
fielder Corey Hanewich and desig
nated player/catcher Danielle
Miller. In particular, the Card will
look to rely on its underclassmen in
the circle with the graduation of
star pitcher Teagan Gerhart.
Freshmen Carley Hoover and Madi
Schreyer, two members of Stan
ford's highly touted recruiting class
of 2013, will join junior Nyree
White in anchoring the pitching
staff this season.
Hoover, a Clemson, S.C. prod
uct, was the 2013 Gatorade Nation
al Player of the Year, as she finished
her high school senior season with a
16-4 record and a nearly unfath
omable 0.15 ERA. In addition,
Hoover hit .500 at the plate while
leading her high school to a South
Carolina state championship.
Schreyer, a Woodinville, Wash,
native, was Washington's Gatorade
Player of the Year in 2012, as she
capped her junior season with a
perfect 21-0 record and a paltry
0.28 ERA in leading Woodinville
High School to a state champi
onship.
In the field, the Cardinal will re
turn six starters from last year's
squad, including sophomore Kayla
