## SEEING GREEN A 						train car named Disaster 
### Holly Moeller 
I once saw a train on fire. Or
rather, it had been on fire quite
recently and was now charred
black and still smoking, making its
way at a good clip down the tracks
next to the Montana highway on
which Dad and I were driving. Two
men leaned over the rails of the
rear caboose, using massive hoses
to spray water on the vegetation
beside the tracks, evidently to snuff
out any sparks left in the train's
wake. It seemed like a risky strate
gy-
It was a sight I'd never expect
ed, and one I didn't figure on seeing
again until late last year, when
stories of flaming, even exploding
trains seemed to suddenly fill the
news.
What changed to make such a
seemingly safe transportation
method so dramatically hazardous?
The cargo.
Chivvied by calls for energy se
curity (loosely translated as "Drill,
baby, drill on American soil" by
our politicians), the rail system has
been shouldering more and more of
the crude oil burden as domestic
production has increased.
Usually, when I think of over
land oil transportation, I think of
pipelines, like the 800-mile-long
Trans-Alaska, a 4-foot-wide snake
linking Prudhoe Bay to the ship
ping port of Valdez; or the Key
stone-XL, winding its way through
a mire of environmental risk as
sessments and political battles.
But recently, as domestic oil
production has climbed to almost
6.5 million barrels per day, pipeline
construction hasn't kept up.
Pipelines cost money, time and
political willpower to build. Train
tracks, on the other hand, are al
ready there. It's easy to adjust the
number of payloads according to
supply and demand. And, since
America's industrial centers are al
ready linked by railroad tracks, it's
easy to adjust routes as some oil
fields are exhausted and other de
posits are found.
Sounds like a pipe-less dream
come true.
But not if you talk to Aliceville,
Ala., locals who had to wait out a
multi-day blaze after a fiery derail
ment last November. Or to the citi
zens of Casselton, North Dakota,
who got a 400,000-gallon spill and
1,400-person evacuation for Christ
mas just seven weeks later.
Perhaps the worst accident oc
curred in Quebec last July, when an
explosive derailment killed 47. And
in a near miss last month, a train
derailed, but didn't leak, in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
In 2013 alone, railroad accidents
spilled 1.15 million gallons of crude
oil. That's enough to fill two
Olympic-sized swimming pools
and more than the total amount
spilled in the 37-year span between
1975 and 2012.
In part, we're spilling more be
cause we're transporting more.
Last year, railroads transported
10% of U.S. oil field production in
400,000 railroad carloads. That's al
most double the number transport
ed in 2012, itself staggering in com
parison to just 9,500 carloads in
2008.
But we're also taking unaccept
able risks. Crude oil is carried in
flimsy cars of outdated design. And
crude oil from the booming Bakken
fields under Montana, N.D., and

parts of Canada seems to be partic
ularly flammable. So a derailment
is more likely to cause a spill, and
that spill is more likely to burst in
to flame.
What are we doing about these
risks? Hand waving, mostly.
A joint recommendation from
the United States National Trans
portation Safety Board and its
Canadian equivalent called for
tighter regulations and routes that
avoid population centers. The two
boards are virtually powerless,
though, so railroad moguls have po
litely said, "Yes, of course, we're al
ready working on it," and carried
on without the expensive retro
fitting required. The Federal Rail
road Administration, charged with
fining non-compliant companies in
to submission, appears to be set
tling for a shrug and slap on the
wrist.
The U.S. government seems to
have accepted these hazards as the
"cost of doing business" for fossil
fuel-based energy security. In a
way, it isn't an incorrect appraisal
of the situation. As we vertically in
tegrate oil extraction, refinement
and use within our own borders,
we'll face more of the environmen
tal hazards and safety conse
quences. And there will always be
consequences: the Exxon Valdez,
Deep-water Horizon, tracking
pollution, and now railroad spills
are neither the first nor the last.
Last year, two of the biggest
pipeline leaks (Arkansas in May
and North Dakota in September)
spilled almost as much oil as the
railroads did.
I, however, am not willing to ac
cept these consequences. Railroads
already transport hazardous mate
rials safely: They should extend use
of these cars and techniques to
crude oil. We should charge steep
fines for accidents, using some of
the money for railroad upgrades if
we must, but primarily to fund re
newable energy infrastructure.
Wind farms and solar panel banks
have their limitations, but at least
they won't go "boom" in my back
yard.

ularly flammable. So a derailment
is more likely to cause a spill, and
that spill is more likely to burst in
to flame.
What are we doing about these
risks? Hand waving, mostly.
A joint recommendation from
the United States National Trans
portation Safety Board and its
Canadian equivalent called for
tighter regulations and routes that
avoid population centers. The two
boards are virtually powerless,
though, so railroad moguls have po
litely said, "Yes, of course, we're al
ready working on it," and carried
on without the expensive retro
fitting required. The Federal Rail
road Administration, charged with
fining non-compliant companies in
to submission, appears to be set
tling for a shrug and slap on the
wrist.
The U.S. government seems to
have accepted these hazards as the
"cost of doing business" for fossil
fuel-based energy security. In a
way, it isn't an incorrect appraisal
of the situation. As we vertically in
tegrate oil extraction, refinement
and use within our own borders,
we'll face more of the environmen
tal hazards and safety conse
quences. And there will always be
consequences: the Exxon Valdez,
Deep-water Horizon, tracking
pollution, and now railroad spills
are neither the first nor the last.
Last year, two of the biggest
pipeline leaks (Arkansas in May
and North Dakota in September)
spilled almost as much oil as the
railroads did.
I, however, am not willing to ac
cept these consequences. Railroads
already transport hazardous mate
rials safely: They should extend use
of these cars and techniques to
crude oil. We should charge steep
fines for accidents, using some of
the money for railroad upgrades if
we must, but primarily to fund re
newable energy infrastructure.
Wind farms and solar panel banks
have their limitations, but at least
they won't go "boom" in my back
yard.

Crude oil is

design.


I once saw a train on fire. Or
rather, it had been on fire quite
recently and was now charred
black and still smoking, making its
way at a good clip down the tracks
next to the Montana highway on
which Dad and I were driving. Two
men leaned over the rails of the
rear caboose, using massive hoses
to spray water on the vegetation
beside the tracks, evidently to snuff
out any sparks left in the train's
wake. It seemed like a risky strate
gy-
It was a sight I'd never expect
ed, and one I didn't figure on seeing
again until late last year, when
stories of flaming, even exploding
trains seemed to suddenly fill the
news.
What changed to make such a
seemingly safe transportation
method so dramatically hazardous?
The cargo.
Chivvied by calls for energy se
curity (loosely translated as "Drill,
baby, drill on American soil" by
our politicians), the rail system has
been shouldering more and more of
the crude oil burden as domestic
production has increased.
Usually, when I think of over
land oil transportation, I think of
pipelines, like the 800-mile-long
Trans-Alaska, a 4-foot-wide snake
linking Prudhoe Bay to the ship
ping port of Valdez; or the Key
stone-XL, winding its way through
a mire of environmental risk as
sessments and political battles.
But recently, as domestic oil
production has climbed to almost
6.5 million barrels per day, pipeline
construction hasn't kept up.
Pipelines cost money, time and
political willpower to build. Train
tracks, on the other hand, are al
ready there. It's easy to adjust the
number of payloads according to
supply and demand. And, since
America's industrial centers are al
ready linked by railroad tracks, it's
easy to adjust routes as some oil
fields are exhausted and other de
posits are found.
Sounds like a pipe-less dream
come true.
But not if you talk to Aliceville,
Ala., locals who had to wait out a
multi-day blaze after a fiery derail
ment last November. Or to the citi
zens of Casselton, North Dakota,
who got a 400,000-gallon spill and
1,400-person evacuation for Christ
mas just seven weeks later.
Perhaps the worst accident oc
curred in Quebec last July, when an
explosive derailment killed 47. And
in a near miss last month, a train
derailed, but didn't leak, in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
In 2013 alone, railroad accidents
spilled 1.15 million gallons of crude
oil. That's enough to fill two
Olympic-sized swimming pools
and more than the total amount
spilled in the 37-year span between
1975 and 2012.
In part, we're spilling more be
cause we're transporting more.
Last year, railroads transported
10% of U.S. oil field production in
400,000 railroad carloads. That's al
most double the number transport
ed in 2012, itself staggering in com
parison to just 9,500 carloads in
2008.
But we're also taking unaccept
able risks. Crude oil is carried in
flimsy cars of outdated design. And
crude oil from the booming Bakken
fields under Montana, N.D., and

parts of Canada seems to be partic
ularly flammable. So a derailment
is more likely to cause a spill, and
that spill is more likely to burst in
to flame.
