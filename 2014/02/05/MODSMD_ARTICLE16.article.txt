# ANDREWS ASSESSMENT
## Coming to college; falling from faith 
### McKenzie Andrews 
In high school, my family went to
church every Sunday.
I went to a Christian elementary
school, and we had a Bible class with
New and Old Testament sing-a
longs. As I got a bit older, my youth
group went on church ski trips and
fundraised for Heifer Ranch
(hunger relief) and Invisible Chil
dren (Uganda). We went on mission
trips to places that weren't
Nashville, Tenn., and I had my first
kiss (on the cheek) with a boy I met
at church camp. By high school, I
helped teach a Sunday school class,
volunteered at Vacation Bible School
and played basketball in the church
league.
When I moved abroad, I found a
bilingual church and befriended the
Texan preacher who'd traveled there
to convert the locals. To be honest, I
don't think moving to a foreign coun
try where you don't speak the lan
guage is the best way to spread the
gospel, but it was nice to meet anoth
er American.
In summary: Church was a big
part of my pre-collegiate experience,
and I was quite involved in my faith
community.
Fast forward to Stanford. I
thought about going to church, but

church sort of fell to the wayside giv
en other weekend revelries. I was in
vited to a nearby church once in fall
quarter, and the new church scared
me. My home church has an organ
and hymnals, and the average age of
parishioners is about fifty-five.
Rather than seeing faces I had
known since I was born, I was at a
contemporary church with a rock
band, flat-screen TVs and a light
show filled with young people from
Palo Alto. I didn't connect with any
one, and I didn't go back that year.
During freshman year, I was
scared to get deeply involved with
campus religious groups because I
wanted to experience college. I was
unsure if I'd make a truly diverse
group of friends if I got really in
volved in a ministry group with a
large social component.
I was also lazy. It takes work to
develop a connection to a church in
college. I didn't put that work in.
When I got to church, it was uncom
fortable to be in a new scene sur
rounded by people I didn't know, and
I didn't stick it out. My senior year of
high school, I gave the sermon at
Youth Sunday. My freshman year, I
was intimidated by stepping into a
new church.
Falling away from church while

starting college is a common story.
I've met so many Stanford students
who used to be Catholic and stopped
at some point in their life. As a
Methodist, I've been guilty too. It's
not even that I don't want to go to
church; it's just that my Sunday
morning starts around when brunch
opens. By the time it's close to 4 EM.
or 10 EM. for services at MemChu,
I'm at the gym or working on an as
signment. Commitment is hard, and
finding a new faith community is
daunting.
At Stanford and in life, I've found
that if someone says they're too busy
to be doing something, it's because
they aren't prioritizing it. If I had
made a real effort to spend two
hours a week going to a church since
freshman year, I would have found
the time.
Across the United States, the re
tention rate for young people stay
ing in faith communities as they
transition to college is low. According
to a Life Way Research study, two
thirds of young adults who attend a
church in high school will stop at
tending church regularly for at least
a year between the age of 18 and 22.
In my home church, the big draw
was "fellowship" a Christian term
for socializing, but more importantly,
generally caring and staying up to
date with those in your community.
Fellowship, whether it's in your
dorm or in your faith community, has
to be built, and that isn't going to
happen if you don't put in the time.
There are great faith communi
ties on campus. Hillel hosts 6 p.m.
Friday Shabbat services followed by
dinners. There are Christian groups
such as Intervarsity, Cardinal Life
and Chi Alpha. Every Friday at 1:15
p.m., the Islamic Society of Stanford
University holds Jummah, or com
munity prayers, on the third floor of
Old Union. There are also Sikh, Hin
du and Baha'i options. I recently
went back to Sanctuary, the contem
porary Christian Sunday night serv
ice; pick-up at the Escondido turn
around is around 6:50 p.m.
If you're interested, these com
munities exist and bring students to
gether. If you want to reconnect with
your faith or are interested in ex
ploring it, there are choices on Stan
ford campus. Though conversations
around religion aren't as prevalent
here as they are at BYU or Yeshiva
University, Stanford has religious
options.

don't think moving to a foreign coun
try where you don't speak the lan
guage is the best way to spread the
gospel, but it was nice to meet anoth
er American.
In summary: Church was a big
part of my pre-collegiate experience,
and I was quite involved in my faith
community.
Fast forward to Stanford. I
thought about going to church, but

church sort of fell to the wayside giv
en other weekend revelries. I was in
vited to a nearby church once in fall
quarter, and the new church scared
me. My home church has an organ
and hymnals, and the average age of
parishioners is about fifty-five.
Rather than seeing faces I had
known since I was born, I was at a
contemporary church with a rock
band, flat-screen TVs and a light
show filled with young people from
Palo Alto. I didn't connect with any
one, and I didn't go back that year.
During freshman year, I was
scared to get deeply involved with
campus religious groups because I
wanted to experience college. I was
unsure if I'd make a truly diverse
group of friends if I got really in
volved in a ministry group with a
large social component.
I was also lazy. It takes work to
develop a connection to a church in
college. I didn't put that work in.
When I got to church, it was uncom
fortable to be in a new scene sur
rounded by people I didn't know, and
I didn't stick it out. My senior year of
high school, I gave the sermon at
Youth Sunday. My freshman year, I
was intimidated by stepping into a
new church.
Falling away from church while

starting college is a common story.
I've met so many Stanford students
who used to be Catholic and stopped
at some point in their life. As a
Methodist, I've been guilty too. It's
not even that I don't want to go to
church; it's just that my Sunday
morning starts around when brunch
opens. By the time it's close to 4 EM.
or 10 EM. for services at MemChu,
I'm at the gym or working on an as
signment. Commitment is hard, and
finding a new faith community is
daunting.
At Stanford and in life, I've found
that if someone says they're too busy
to be doing something, it's because
they aren't prioritizing it. If I had
made a real effort to spend two
hours a week going to a church since
freshman year, I would have found
the time.
Across the United States, the re
tention rate for young people stay
ing in faith communities as they
transition to college is low. According
to a Life Way Research study, two
thirds of young adults who attend a
church in high school will stop at
tending church regularly for at least
a year between the age of 18 and 22.
In my home church, the big draw
was "fellowship" a Christian term
for socializing, but more importantly,
generally caring and staying up to
date with those in your community.
Fellowship, whether it's in your
dorm or in your faith community, has
to be built, and that isn't going to
happen if you don't put in the time.
There are great faith communi
ties on campus. Hillel hosts 6 p.m.
Friday Shabbat services followed by
dinners. There are Christian groups
such as Intervarsity, Cardinal Life
and Chi Alpha. Every Friday at 1:15
p.m., the Islamic Society of Stanford
University holds Jummah, or com
munity prayers, on the third floor of
Old Union. There are also Sikh, Hin
du and Baha'i options. I recently
went back to Sanctuary, the contem
porary Christian Sunday night serv
ice; pick-up at the Escondido turn
around is around 6:50 p.m.
If you're interested, these com
munities exist and bring students to
gether. If you want to reconnect with
your faith or are interested in ex
ploring it, there are choices on Stan
ford campus. Though conversations
around religion aren't as prevalent
here as they are at BYU or Yeshiva
University, Stanford has religious
options.

In high school, my family went to
church every Sunday.
I went to a Christian elementary
school, and we had a Bible class with
New and Old Testament sing-a
longs. As I got a bit older, my youth
group went on church ski trips and
fundraised for Heifer Ranch
(hunger relief) and Invisible Chil
dren (Uganda). We went on mission
trips to places that weren't
Nashville, Tenn., and I had my first
kiss (on the cheek) with a boy I met
at church camp. By high school, I
helped teach a Sunday school class,
volunteered at Vacation Bible School
and played basketball in the church
league.
When I moved abroad, I found a
bilingual church and befriended the
Texan preacher who'd traveled there
to convert the locals. To be honest, I
don't think moving to a foreign coun
try where you don't speak the lan
guage is the best way to spread the
gospel, but it was nice to meet anoth
