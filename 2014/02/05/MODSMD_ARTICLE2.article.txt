### MARSHALL WATKINS EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael
McFaul 'B6 M.A. 'B6 will step down from his
current position and return to Stanford at
the end of the month following the conclu
sion of the Winter Olympics in Sochi, ac
cording to an announcement made Tuesday
morning.
McFaul, who worked at Stanford as a
professor of political science and as a senior
fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for
International Studies (FSI) before assum
ing his post in Moscow in 2012, cited a de
sire to reunite with his family who re
turned to California last summer as the
principal reason for his departure.
"We tried to make a 9,000 kilometer
commute work for our family," McFaul
wrote in a blog post. "But after seven
months of separation, I simply need to be
with my family again ... It's time for us to
be reunited."
