## Ambassador to Russia set to rejoin faculty Michael McFaul will step down at the conclusion of the Sochi Olympics 
### MARSHALL WATKINS EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael
McFaul 'B6 M.A. 'B6 will step down from his
current position and return to Stanford at
the end of the month following the conclu
sion of the Winter Olympics in Sochi, ac
cording to an announcement made Tuesday
morning.
McFaul, who worked at Stanford as a
professor of political science and as a senior
fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for
International Studies (FSI) before assum
ing his post in Moscow in 2012, cited a de
sire to reunite with his family who re
turned to California last summer as the
principal reason for his departure.
"We tried to make a 9,000 kilometer
commute work for our family," McFaul
wrote in a blog post. "But after seven
months of separation, I simply need to be
with my family again ... It's time for us to
be reunited."
McFaul added that Stan
ford would be his "base of
operations" for "the immedi
ate future," though he plans
to remain involved with

some specific Obama admin
istration projects as well. Ac
cording to FSI spokesman
Adam Gorlick, McFaul will
continue as an FSI senior
fellow.
"Ambassador McFaul's
return is a sterling opportu
nity for Stanford and FSI,"
said FSI Director Mariano-
Florentino Cuellar M.A.'96

Ph.D.'OO in a statement. "We
hope to engage him in the
Institute's work on gover
nance, technology and secu
rity. His unique experience
as a diplomat and a leading
scholar are enormous assets
to our centers and educa
tional programs, and to the
entire university."
McFaul's tenure in
Moscow, which continued an
affiliation with the Obama
administration dating back
to the 2008 presidential cam
paign, has been a tumul
tuous one. His meetings with
opposition politicians during
a cycle of anti-government
protests shortly after his ar
rival elicited extensive criti
cism from the Kremlin, and
U.S.-Russia relations
reached a nadir last year
with Russia's granting of
asylum to Edward Snowden
and the subsequent cancella
tion of a summit meeting be
tween the two country's
leaders.
Nevertheless, McFaul
often credited as the archi
tect of the "reset" in rela
tions between Washington
and Moscow also played
an integral role in major
achievements by the Obama
administration with regards
to Russia, such as the New
START Treaty, Russia's ac
cession to the World Trade
Organization, negotiations
with Iran and efforts to facil
itate the resupply of troops
in Afghanistan.
"President Obama is
deeply grateful for Ambas
sador McFaul's extraordi
nary service over the last
five years," said Deputy Na
tional Security Adviser Ben
Rhodes in a statement.
"Mike has been tireless in
advocating for the universal
values that America stands
for around the world, reach
ing out to civil society and
recognizing the right of
every voice to be heard."
