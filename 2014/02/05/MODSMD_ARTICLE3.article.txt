# Grilled cheese hits dorms
## Google employee gives sandwiches to students 
### TIFFANY LAM 
A new late night dining option
is the talk of the town, with fresh
ly made grilled cheese sandwich
es being handed out preceded
only by announcements from the
Twitter handle @gcGrillaz
every Thursday evening this
quarter in a series of dorms.
Michael Rennaker, the man
behind GC Grillaz, is a Google
employee and a member of C 3
Silicon Valley Church. Having
met a number of current Stan
ford students through the latter
affiliation, he leveraged those re
lationships to bring GC Grillaz to
Crothers and Kimball. As word
of the service spread however,
other Stanford students ex
pressed interest in bringing Ren
naker â€” who said that he funds
GC Grillaz in its entirety through
his own means to their resi
dences.
"It's just cool to see how hap
py people are," Rennaker, who
visited Branner last Thursday,
said. "I want to spread love and

happiness that's what it's all
about. I want everyone to know
that people care."
Rennaker framed the ser
vice's creation as stemming from
memories of his brother a for
mer Wilbur resident assistant
(RA) making grilled cheese
sandwiches for his residents.
Rennaker said that he recalls
"seeing the strong community"
fostered by his brother, particu
larly amongst students that were
visibly stressed out through
"working so hard and focused on
their studies."
"At Stanford, there's so much
pressure in such a competitive
environment, but there's some
thing special about bringing peo
ple together to just hang out," he
said.
Students in attendance in
Branner on Thursday expressed
gratitude for the service.
"I thought it was pretty cool
everyone likes sandwiches,"
said Osama El-Gabalawy 'l5, a

Branner RA. "I think most
people were there for the
food, so it was a noble effort
to build community."
Marathon coders and
late-night thesis writers ex
pressed particular apprecia
tion, with one Branner resi
dent approaching Rennaker
and yelling, "What is this
unprovoked benevolence?"
Meanwhile, an unusually

crowded Branner lounge
seemed to validate Ren
naker's efforts on its own.
"I gave sandwiches to
two people who lived two
doors away from each other
and had just met!" he said
proudly.
Rennaker said that he
plans to visit West Lag this
week and wants to continue
delivering grilled cheese
sandwiches and bringing
students together for the
rest of the year.
