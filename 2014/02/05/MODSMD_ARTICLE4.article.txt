# STUDENT LIFE
## Student-run sitcom to launch 
### SKYLAR COHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A Stanford-centric comedy series may be coming
soon to a Youlbbe channel near you, with "The Slump"
an online sitcom by newly established student organ
ization The Stanford Sitcom Project—planned for re
lease in the first week of spring quarter.
Participating students are currently in the writing
phase for their show, according to Project president
Magellan Pfluke'l6, but they expect to begin filming in
three weeks. The 10-episode series will mainly focus on
a group of five Stanford sophomores, with a different

sixth actor featured each week. Each episode will
be approximately 10 minutes, using a single cam
era setup (like "The Office" or "Scrubs"). The
group hopes to create two series per year.
Pfluke, who is also a staff writer for the Stan
ford Flipside, said that he was inspired to start the
project by a desire to counterbalance his humor
wilting with more physical comedy. He invited a
group of friends from freshman year to form an
executive board that would oversee the project.

the project, noted that the ex
ecutive board was made up of
a diverse range of students,
providing a wide representa
tion of Stanford life.
"It just fell together so
perfectly because we all
somehow had this connection
to this project," Bane said.
Pfluke also noted that
each episode has a distinct
character, allowing different
writers to draw on different
sources for inspiration but al
so presenting the challenge
of identifying a unifying sto
ryline.
"I think the main difficul
ty at this point is creating an
idea for the show that is
broad enough that we can
have a lot of different
episodes in it but also narrow
enough that when a writer
sits down to write characters
they know who they're writ
ing," Pfluke said.
Participants framed the
project's meetings as con
ducive to lively discussion be
tween members and as allow
ing every participant to influ
ence the final product.
"It's veiy fun and fast
paced, [with] quick wit, and
it's easy to get a word in,"
said Tom Colton 'l4, one of
the organization's twenty
members. "But at the same
time it's also just a lot of ban
ter and a lot of great ideas be
ing thrown around by a lot of
people with similar and dif
ferent senses of humor."
Although writing teams
for the show have already
been assigned, the Sitcom
Project is also holding script
workshop sessions so that in
terested students can partici
pate. Pfluke emphasized the
need to be as inclusive as pos
sible in the project.
"I think our vision for this
group is that it's going to be a
diverse showcase of student
talent," Pfluke said. "I just
want to get as many talented,
artistic people involved in this
as possible."
