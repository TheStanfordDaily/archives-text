## Student-run sitcom to launch 
### SKYLAR COHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A Stanford-centric comedy series may be coming
soon to a Youlbbe channel near you, with "The Slump"
an online sitcom by newly established student organ
ization The Stanford Sitcom Projectâ€”planned for re
lease in the first week of spring quarter.
Participating students are currently in the writing
phase for their show, according to Project president
Magellan Pfluke'l6, but they expect to begin filming in
three weeks. The 10-episode series will mainly focus on
a group of five Stanford sophomores, with a different

sixth actor featured each week. Each episode will
be approximately 10 minutes, using a single cam
era setup (like "The Office" or "Scrubs"). The
group hopes to create two series per year.
Pfluke, who is also a staff writer for the Stan
ford Flipside, said that he was inspired to start the
project by a desire to counterbalance his humor
wilting with more physical comedy. He invited a
group of friends from freshman year to form an
executive board that would oversee the project.
