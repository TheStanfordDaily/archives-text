# Martin texts revealed
## Stanford referenced in text exchange with Richie Incognito 
### GEORGE CHEN EDITOR IN CHIEF 
A transcript containing more
than 1,000 text messages report
edly exchanged between former
Miami Dolphins offensive line
men Jonathan Martin 'l2 and
Richie Incognito from October
2012 to November 2013 was pub
lished by The Big Lead on Mon
day, just a few days before the
NFL plans to release its findings
on the controversial bullying
scandal surrounding the two ex
teammates.
Most of the reported conver
sations between Martin and In
cognito revolved around parties,
nightclubs and sex, but Martin
who returned to Stanford for
winter quarter to finish his de
gree also made multiple refer
ences to Stanford in his text mes
sages to Incognito.
The first of these texts refer
encing Stanford came on Nov. 30,
2012, when in response to an ex
plicit remark by Incognito re
garding the small crowd at Pac
-12 Championship Game between
Stanford and UCLA, Martin
texted Incognito "Stanford fans
are weak... It'll be full at game
time [though]." Following that
conversation, Martin bantered
with Incognito about the 2013
Rose Bowl Game and then told
Incognito in February that he
was training at Stanford in the
offseason.
The messages obtained by
The Big Lead are reportedly
from a league source, but Incog
nito's attorney, Mark Schamel,
also provided a transcript to

CBS4 News in Miami last week.
The text message transcript
is the latest development in the
heavily debated bullying inci
dent. Three months ago, ESPN
reported that Incognito used
racial slurs and profanity in his
cellular communications with
Martin on multiple occasions.
Martin left the Dolphins to seek
help in dealing with emotional is
sues, drawing criticisms from
some NFL players for the way
he handled the situation. He was
placed on the non-football illness
list on Nov. 30, while Dolphins
owner Stephen Ross offered his
public support for Martin and
cut ties with Incognito.
But last week, Incognito's at
torney claimed that Martin's
texts to Incognito had been
equally vulgar and derogatory,
reigniting the debate surround
ing the NFEs locker room cul
ture and bringing to question
whether Martin had played a
role in fueling the exchange of in

suiting epithets between the two
players.
The NFL expects that its in
vestigation will be completed this
week.
Throughout the process,
many of Martin's former Stan
ford teammates and coaches, in
cluding David DeCastro 'l2, An
drew Luck 'l2, Coby Fleener
'll, Zach Ertz 'l3 and head
coach David Shaw, rallied
around him. Martin was seen at
a Stanford tailgate party before
the USC game in mid-Novem
ber and also watched the game
from the Stanford sideline.
"We're talking about some
thing that, as more comes out,
we're finding out this is not just
Jon being oversensitive," Shaw
told the San Jose Mercury News
in early November. "This is
Jonathan being the first person
to speak about what's been go
ing on."
A two-time Ail-American left
tackle at Stanford, Martin was
selected by the Dolphins in the
second round of the 2012 NFL
Draft. Martin started at right
tackle during the first 12 games
of his rookie season before mov
ing to left tackle at the start of
the 2013 season.
