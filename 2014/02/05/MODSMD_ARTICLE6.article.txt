# STUDENT GROUPS
## Haas awards first social impact grants Two students receive $1,000 for community projects 
### CLARISSE PERALTA DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
The Haas Center for Public Serv
ice has selected two recipients for its
Social Impact Grant, a newly created
award that offers undergraduates
and co-terms up to $l,OOO to execute
projects with the "potential to make
a significant impact."
"We're funding either individual
students or groups of students who
have an innovation idea to address
existing community problems," said
Lucia Constantine, public service
leadership and postgraduate pro
grams coordinator.
This year's winners, Nishant Ja
cob 'l3 and Haque Ishfaq 'l5, were
selected from 40 applicants in the
grant's pilot round.
Jacob had proposed the creation
of a crowd-funding app that would
raise funds on behalf of non-profits in
India, while Ishfaq will use the grant
to start a math camp for girls in
Bangladesh.
"We were impressed by the scope
of the projects and the different is
sues that they were addressing,"
Constantine said of all submitted
proposals.
According to George Wang Ph.D.
'O9 ED. 'lO, who served on the selec
tion committee, the proposals were
chosen through a group deliberation
process.
"We were looking for students
that were really trying to do some
thing relatively new, something cre
ative," Wang said.
The committee considered the
novelty and utility of the idea, in ad
dition to feasibility and likelihood of
project completion.
Measuring Impact
Prior to the creation of the Social
Impact Grant, the Haas Center only
offered programs for internships and
summer projects, not for smaller scale
projects.
"We're continuously looking for
ways to expand those opportunities
and make them more accessible to
students," Constantine said.
The new grant came about with
the support of the Westly Founda
tion, a group that backs young Cali
fornian innovators. Constantine de
scribed the Social Impact Grant as a
"mini-Westly" prize for Stan
ford students.

"It's a really great oppor
tunity for students to push
themselves to come up with
quick, innovative ideas
throughout the year," Con
stantine said of the grant's
learning component.
In addition to attending an
orientation workshop, recipi
ents of the grant are required
to submit a final report of
their experience, which will
serve as a measure of the pro
ject's impact.
"It's hard to quantify and
measure impact, but our hope
is to put a little bit of money
on a new idea that has the po
tential to do something
great," Wang said. "The
amount of money per project
is not a lot. It's not the next
thing that will cure cancer, but
it is a little kick start to test

out an idea."
Challenges
Both Constantine and
Wang acknowledged the chal
lenges implicit in introducing
the grant and determining
awardees.
"Coming up with the right
criteria for what we were
looking for is one [challenge],"
Wang said. "It was something
that hadn't existed before, so
we weren't sure what types of
projects would surface."
In addition to determining
how to attract the right appli
cants, the selection committee
also had to determine which
projects would have the most
impact, best fit the grant's in
tention and best use the
funds.
"Social impact can be hard
to determine and it's difficult
to compare projects that have
different metrics of impact,"
Constantine explained.
However, marketing the
opportunity to students
proved to not be a problem, as
the pilot application round for

this grant received many ap
plications.
"There were a lot of really
good projects that we wanted
to fund, but couldn't because
of limitations," Constantine
said.
For subsequent rounds,
Wang said they would add
more specificity to the ques
tions. There will also be some
more restrictions on student
groups applying for grants.
"We had some student
groups apply that hadn't ex
hausted their- ASSU funding,
which they didn't tap into [ful
ly]," Constantine said.
According to Wang, the
first round served as a learn
ing experience that will help
them to further establish the
grant.
"We're essentially taking
what Stanford does really
well, which is starting really
cool companies and channel
ing that towards the public
service sector," Wang said.
