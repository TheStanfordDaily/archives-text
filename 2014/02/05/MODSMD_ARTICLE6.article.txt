### CLARISSE PERALTA DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
The Haas Center for Public Serv
ice has selected two recipients for its
Social Impact Grant, a newly created
award that offers undergraduates
and co-terms up to $l,OOO to execute
projects with the "potential to make
a significant impact."
"We're funding either individual
students or groups of students who

India, while Ishfaq will use the grant
to start a math camp for girls in
Bangladesh.
"We were impressed by the scope
of the projects and the different is

Constantine said of all submitted
proposals.

chosen through a group deliberation
process.
"We were looking for students
that were really trying to do some
thing relatively new, something cre

The committee considered the
novelty and utility of the idea, in ad

project completion.

ways to expand those opportunities
and make them more accessible to
students," Constantine said.
The new grant came about with
the support of the Westly Founda

fornian innovators. Constantine de
