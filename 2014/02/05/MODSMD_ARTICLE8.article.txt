## Senate removes ban on members studying abroad 
### ANDREW VOGELEY DESK EDITOR 
In a short meeting Tuesday
night, the 15th ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate voted to remove the re
striction banning senators from
studying abroad during their term,
in an attempt to make the Senate
more attractive to upperclassmen
and current senators.
"I think this policy creates many
avenues for more experienced peo
ple to serve on Senate," said Senator
John-Lancaster Finley 'l6.
The bill limits the number of sen
ators abroad at any time to three
and allows first-time senators to
study abroad only during the spring
quarter at the end of their term. Re
turning senators will be allowed to
study abroad during any quarter.
"I'm optimistic that [the change]
is going to encourage upperclass
men to run," said Senate Chair Ben
Holston 'l5.
If a senator wants to study
abroad, he or she must submit an
application to the Senate chair, who
will choose up to three senators

whose eligibility to study abroad
will be considered by the rest of the
Senate. The bill outlined sugges
tions that seniority be considered
when evaluating study abroad re
quests.
"It'll be the same as admissions
policies—just because you are a
senior and you fill out a bad applica
tion doesn't mean they will get [the
study abroad] spot because you are
a senior," Finley said. "That might
weigh into the decision, but there
are a lot of things that go into [the
decision]."
Before going abroad, senators
must appoint a proxy to represent
them. Proxies will be allowed to
vote and with the exception of
serving as officers or committee
chairs, from which positions sena
tors going abroad must resign
otherwise act as a full representa
tive of senators who are abroad.
"It is encouraged that the proxy
be in regular communication with
the Senator," Finley said. "The ac
countability is still on the senator
who is abroad. For things that are
done by the proxy, the responsibility

ultimately falls on the senator."
"I think Senate will function well
with this proxy system," Holston
said.
The Senate also heard an update
from the student leaders of SAFE
Reform, with a tentative plan to in
troduce a bill during week seven of
the quarter. Uncertainty remains,
however, over the fate of student
group reserves that have ballooned
under the current system.
Following the precedent set by
their funding of the Robber Barons
trip to a national comedy festival,
the Senate also voted to fund the
Quidditch team's trip to the World
Cup in Myrtle Beach, South Caroli
na with fees from the General Fees
Reserve.
"It's a really cool thing for a
group of Stanford students to do
and I think it helps promote Stan
ford in new fields nationally," Hol
ston said.
In addition, the Senate passed
$16,107.40 in funding bills.
