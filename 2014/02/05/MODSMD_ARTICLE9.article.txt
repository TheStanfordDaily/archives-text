## Reflecting on Manning's NFL legacy 
### Vignesh Venkataraman 
Let's take a moment and
talk about Peyton Man
ning's legacy. I know, I
know, you've all heard this
narrative before. But hu
mor me for a second, because I'm go
ing to take this age-old conversation
in a very different direction.
Even the world's biggest Man
ning fan would have to admit that
Sunday evening was not his finest
performance. Handed, hustled and
under siege for the entirety of the Su
per Bowl, he threw two interceptions
(both of which, though arguably not
his fault, still looked darn ugly) and
seemed unable to drive the ball down
the field.
Peyton Manning, owner of nearly
every single-season passing record
and leader of the most vaunted of
fense in history, was reduced to
Captain Cheekdown.
To put it bluntly, even on a day
on which everything did not go
right for Seattle and everything did
not go wrong for Denver, it would
still have taken a near-perfect per
formance to unlock Seattle's
swarming and ferocious defense.
Scoring eight points in garbage
time just isn't going to cut it.
So what does this tell us? Man
ning's career postseason record
drops to 11-12, giving him the most
postseason losses in NFL history
(hardee har). He is now 1-2 in Su
per Bowls, with a win over the
Bears in a sloppy performance in
2007, a game-clinching interception
against the Saints in a 2010 loss and
last Sunday's debacle. Oxymoroni
cally he is without question the
most respected quarterback alive, a
man who has owned, enhanced and
refined the quarterback position as
we know it today.
The angry mob will argue that
Manning chokes in the clutch, that
he cannot handle the pressure of
the playoffs and the Super Bowl
and that the blame for the 43-8 an
nihilation at the hands of the Sea
hawks rests solely on his shoulders.
The apologists will say that it was
all on the Broncos defense; that if
only Manning had more weapons,
the Broncos would have been able
to compete; that the offensive line
didn't come to play and that Man
ning remains blameless.
In reality, the truth lies some
where in the middle. The Broncos
were outgunned from the start, but
Manning's play certainly didn't
help their cause in any way. To sep
arate one factor from another is im
possible because football is a team
sport. One of the glories (and ago
nies) of team sports is that a team is
only as strong as its weakest link.
From such naturally noisy data,
how can we hope to glean any accu
rate or meaningful insights?
The list of truly once-in-a-life
time quarterbacks is fairly agreed
upon: Unitas, Montana, Elway,
Marino and more that I am hesitant
to list for fear of omitting someone
in my haste to get this article done
on time.
From the current generation,
the guaranteed inductees to this
club seem to be Brady and Man
ning. But it is not enough to be a
part of this group these days; for
whatever reason, we are the gener
ation of absolute rankings, certain
ty, hard facts desirous of some
undeniable logic that proclaims one
person as truly better than another.
Part of that mentality is why, for
the last decade, we've pit Manning
and Brady against each other so
venomously. The dudes are actually
pretty close friends who stay in
touch and genuinely wish each oth
er well. Still, every failure for
Brady is a victory for Manning, and
every success of Manning's coun
termands some achievement from
Brady. In answering the question of
legacy, we seem to lose sight of the
fact that there are 21 guys on the
field who don't have the (mis)for
tune of playing quarterback.
Frankly, I don't think that there
is any way to absolutely rank the
quarterbacks who belong to the
"elite" clique. Do we ding Montana
for being on loaded teams, as we
seem to do to Brady when compar
ing him to Manning? Do we up
grade Marino for being saddled
with poor teams, as we seem to do
to Manning when comparing him to
Brady? What do we do with poor
Jim Kelly, who came up just short
in four Super Bowls? What about
Elway, who lost two Super Bowls at
