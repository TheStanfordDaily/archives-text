## STANFORD NETS IMPORTANT PAC- 12 ROAD WIN 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
In the words of the great Bill Wal
ton: "Every time the Bears tried to
climb back up, the tree just shook off
another layer."

From start to finish, the Stanford
men's basketball team dominated
the archrival California Golden
Bears (15-8,6-4 Pac-12), picking up a
pivotal 80-69 road victory to start the
second half of the conference season
on a winning note.
Fresh off of an upset victory over
then-No. 1 Arizona, Cal simply had
no answer for Stanford's attacking
offense and stingy defense. With the
win, the Cardinal (15-7, 6-4) moved
into a tie with its cross-bay foe for
third place in the Pac-12, as Stanford
tries to ascend its way out of the mid

half of the conference season. The
win avenged Stanford's 69-62 defeat
to Cal at home earlier this season.
Senior forward Dwight Powell
had another banner night for the
Cardinal following a 28-point effort
on Saturday against Arizona State.
Despite shooting just 5-of-17 from
the floor, the all-conference per
former from a season ago finished
with 22 points, 11 rebounds and six
assists, tying his career-high in the
final category for the fifth time. It
was Powell's seventh double-double
of the season, which is best on the
team.
"Dwight didn't shoot the ball as
well as he does, but he provided us
with a presence out on the floor.
Whether he is on the perimeter or
the post, people have to pay so much
attention to what he does," said head
coach Johnny Dawkins." He is capa
ble of scoring himself, but he has
shown that and he is one of the best
players in this conference and I
