## STANFORD NETS IMPORTANT PAC- 12 ROAD WIN 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
In the words of the great Bill Wal
ton: "Every time the Bears tried to
climb back up, the tree just shook off
another layer."

From start to finish, the Stanford
men's basketball team dominated
the archrival California Golden
Bears (15-8,6-4 Pac-12), picking up a
pivotal 80-69 road victory to start the
second half of the conference season
on a winning note.
Fresh off of an upset victory over
then-No. 1 Arizona, Cal simply had
no answer for Stanford's attacking
offense and stingy defense. With the
win, the Cardinal (15-7, 6-4) moved
into a tie with its cross-bay foe for
third place in the Pac-12, as Stanford
tries to ascend its way out of the mid
dle of the pack during the second
half of the conference season. The
win avenged Stanford's 69-62 defeat
to Cal at home earlier this season.
Senior forward Dwight Powell
had another banner night for the
Cardinal following a 28-point effort
on Saturday against Arizona State.
Despite shooting just 5-of-17 from
the floor, the all-conference per
former from a season ago finished
with 22 points, 11 rebounds and six
assists, tying his career-high in the
final category for the fifth time. It
was Powell's seventh double-double
of the season, which is best on the
team.
"Dwight didn't shoot the ball as
well as he does, but he provided us
with a presence out on the floor.
Whether he is on the perimeter or
the post, people have to pay so much
attention to what he does," said head
coach Johnny Dawkins." He is capa
ble of scoring himself, but he has
shown that and he is one of the best
players in this conference and I

think he showed that again
tonight."
Powell certainly wasn't
alone on a night that saw the
Cardinal put forth a com
plete team effort. Junior
guard and birthday boy
Chasson Randle, the second
leading scorer in the Pac-12,
finished with 19 points on 6-
of-10 shooting, while fellow
senior guard Anthony
Brown played a terrific sec
ond half that saw him score
11 of his 16 points.
In defeat, Justin Cobbs
was again outstanding for
Cal, which has now dropped
four of its last five games.
The senior point guard
scored 24 points while
adding five rebounds and
four assists. Aside from a
strong second half by Cobbs'
backcourt mate Tyrone Wal
lace, who tallied 21 points on
8-of-16 shooting, Cal failed
to receive meaningful contri
butions from most of the rest
of its roster. The other nine
Golden Bears who entered
the game combined to shoot
an abysmal 10-of-34 from the
floor, a brutal 29.4 percent
clip that did not get the job
done in a rivalry game of this
magnitude.
While much of Cal's
struggles can be attributed
to poor shooting, credit is
due to the Cardinal, which

played intense, stingy de
fense for large stretches of
the game. Stanford held Cal
to just 41.3 percent shooting
overall, making it the fourth
straight game in which the
Cardinal held a team to 42.1
percent shooting or worse.
On the strength of its de
fense, Stanford raced out to
an early lead thanks to
strong play from Powell and
Randle, who combined to
outscore Cal 22-20 over the
first 14:30 of the game. Stan
ford's lead was at its largest
â€”lB points when Randle
knocked down a 3-pointer to
give the Cardinal a 38-20 ad
vantage with 6:36 remaining
in the first half.
The Bears made things
interesting by dominating
the rest of the first half, most
ly thanks to a 12-point explo
sion by Cobbs over the final
5:15 of the period to draw Cal
within six at the midway
point. His back-to-back 3-
pointers on the final two pos
sessions of the half made it
seem as if the Bears had
awoken from their hiberna
tion, but it was not to be for
California on this night.
Stanford's lead remained
in single digits for the first
10 minutes of the second
half, until the Cardinal held
the Bears scoreless for a
four-minute stretch to push
its lead to 13. Cal would nev
er again get closer than 11
points, and Brown's heady
play down the stretch for
Stanford ensured that the
Cardinal would be able to

coast to victory.
"They closed the half
with two 3-pointers and cut
the lead to six," Dawkins
said. "I was like 'where is my
team,' and I found out a lot
about us. I found out that
our guys have a lot of sub
stance to weather that
storm, come out and re
group. That says a lot about
their character."
It was Stanford's second
consecutive win in Berkeley
following an 83-70 triumph
in Haas Pavilion last March
6. The win pushed head
coach Johnny Dawkins' ca
reer record on the road in
conference play to just 15-
34, but Stanford has been
much tougher away from
Maples this season. The Car
dinal now stands at 3-2 on
the road in the Pac-12 during
its current campaign moving
into road games at Washing
ton and Washington State
next week.
Most importantly, the win
over Cal gives Stanford its
fourth victory over a team
ranked in the top 50 of the
Ratings Percentage Index
(RPI), a pivotal statistic
used to determine which
teams will make the NCAA
tournament. Coach Johnny
Dawkins, now in his sixth
season at the helm of Cardi
nal basketball, is still seek
ing to lead Stanford to the
tournament for first time in
his career as head coach.
