## UCSD, UCI visit Maples 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 7 Stanford men's vol
leyball team will be looking to use
its decisive win last Saturday
against Cal State Northridge to
try and improve its home record to
5-1 when it hosts unranked UC-
San Diego on Friday d No. 9 UC-
Irvine on Saturday. After Stan
ford's recently tough road trips
that saw the squad lose to No. 1
UCLA and No. 4 BYU in close
matches, the Cardinal returned
home last week and split a week
end homestand with a disappoint
ing loss to No. 6 Long Beach State.
This weekend, with the Cardinal
facing two lower-ranked oppo
nents, there will be a critical oppor
tunity for Stanford to improve its
record in conference play.
Stanford will face UC-San
Diego on Friday, and the match is a
must-win for Stanford if it wishes
to be competitive in postseason
play. UC-San Diego has yet to win
a game, with a 0-9 record overall
and a 0-8 record in the MPSF.
UCSD has faced very tough oppo
nents and has played all but two
matches on the road, which could
be significant factors in explaining
why the team has only won two
sets so far this season.
The Cardinal leads the series
with UCSD 41-3 and holds a five
game winning streak against the
Tritons. Last time UCSD won at
Maples was in the 2011 season, in
an upset against the defending na
tional champion Cardinal. UCSD's
offense is not as strong as the Car
dinal's and its hitting power is lim
ited to a few players. Senior out
side hitter Nick Lorfino leads the
team in kills along with senior op
posite Johi Awerkamp. While Aw
erkamp had a season-high 18 kills
against Cal Baptist to demonstrate
that UCSD can hit against top of
fenses, the team has not yet been
able to overcome the hitting power
