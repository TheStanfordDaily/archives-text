## Card looks to stay perfect in Pac- 12 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
With two consecutive wins over
then-No. 19 Cal last week, the
Stanford women's basketball team
(21-1,10-0 Pac-12) was finally able
to move past the No. 4 spot it had

held throughout Pac-12 play and
advanced to No. 3 in the nation by
jumping Duke, who lost to No. 2
Notre Dame on Sunday.
The Card will head to Washing
ton this weekend with a new rank
ing, but the same Pac-12 Player of
the Week. Senior forward Chiney
Ogwumike was again honored with
the award for her aggressive play
on both the offensive and defensive
sides of the ball against the Golden
Bears. This marks the seventh

time this year and the 16th time in
her career that Ogwumike has re
ceived the award.
Ogwumike is the only player in
the nation to rank in the top 10 na
tionally in field-goal percentage
(63.3 percent), scoring (27 points
per game), rebounding (12 re
bounds per game) and double-dou
bles (16). Junior point guard Am
ber Orrange joins Ogwumike in
the national rankings as she sits at
sixth in assist-to-turnover ratio
(3.25).
The Card will first take on
Washington State (12-10, 6-4) on
Friday, which is currently in a tie
with Cal for fourth place in the
Pac-12. The Cougars had a sur
prisingly stellar start to their Pac
-12 campaign, as they went 5-0 in
the conference before losing soph
omore point guard sensation Lia
Galdeira to injury for a game
against Utah. Even with her re
turn the Cougars have lost four
out of their last five conference
games since the perfect start to
the season.
The Cougars are led by junior
guard Tia Presley, who is sixth in
the Pac-12 in scoring with her av
erage of 18.2 ppg. Galdeira is on
her heels with 18.0 ppg, including
18.2 ppg in conference play. The
two have each recorded seven 20-
point games so far this season and
carried the Cougars' offensive ef
forts on their shoulders. The last
time the Card and Cougars met
was in the 2013 Pac-12 Tourna
ment, when Galdeira scored 16
points in the Card's quarterfinal
win.
The Cougars play the 15th
toughest schedule in the nation
and have done fairly well, notching
wins over three top-25 schools:
then-No. 10 Nebraska, then-No.
21 Colorado and then-No. 24 Ari
zona State. After splitting a series
in Los Angeles, the Cougars will
now hope to channel its level of
play from the beginning of the con
ference slate in order to win a top
four spot in the Pac-12 and receive
a bye for the first round of the Pac
-12 Tournament in March.
On Sunday, the Cardinal will
take on Washington (12-9, 5-5) in
Seattle. The Huskies are coming

Junior guard Amber Orrange (33) will not only be asked to continue
her excellent offensive play but also to shutdown the talented backcourts
of both Washington and Washington State this weekend.
off of their first sweep of the
Los Angeles schools since
2002 and, after a disappoint
ing start to the season, will
try to crawl past the logjam
of teams trailing Stanford
and Arizona State in the
Pac-12 to fight for a bye in
the Pac-12 Tournament as
well.
The Huskies are led by
junior point guard Jazmine
Davis (19.4 ppg, 4 rpg, 3.3

assists per game) and fresh
man guard Kelsey Plum
(19.8 ppg, 4.3 rpg). Plum
won gold with Team USA at
the 2013 U-19 World Cham
pionships and had a career
high 35 points against Col
orado this season. Plum and
Davis combine for 54 per
cent of the Huskies' offen
sive output and make up the
nation's second-highest
scoring backcourt duo at
39.2 ppg. Plum is also the
nation's second-leading
freshman in scoring. Davis

Lieberman Watch List for

The Cardinal will need to
play target defense and shut
down the duo of Galdeira
and Presley against Wash
ington State on Friday and
the backcourt team of Plum
and Davis against Washing
ton, and also have someone
step up to complement the
scoring of Ogwumike.
Tipoff at Washington
State on Friday is set for 6
p.m. with game time at
Washington set for 12:30
p.m. on Sunday.
