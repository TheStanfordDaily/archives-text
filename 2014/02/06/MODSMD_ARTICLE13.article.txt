# OPINIONS
## OP-ED The 						Year of the Arts 
### JEREMY HSU Ph.D. candidate in biology, President of the Stanford Symphony Orchestra 
It takes a lot for something to
catch my attention when I'm
biking, and it takes an especial
ly striking scene to cause me to pull
over and dismount. Both of those
were accomplished last week,
though, when I was biking on Es
condido Road towards Meyer Li
brary. A huge red steel structure
which most certainly hadn't been
there before winter break arose
out of the foggy mist, intriguing me
with its weaving lines, all seeming
ly converging at a singular space.
It turned out that the aforemen
tioned structure ( The Sieve of
Eratosthenes, a sign informed
me) was a sculpture, a part of the
University's outdoor art collection.
Yet despite its mysterious appear
ance, the sculpture had accom
plished its goal it had caused me
to stop, ponder its meaning and ad
mire its gleaming outline in the set
ting sun.
For me, that one ephemeral mo
ment was poignant, a tribute to the
power of the arts. How else could
an assembly of steel beams, which
was in all practical senses useless,
trigger such a wave of emotion?
This is the magic of the arts: no
matter the art form sculpture,
music, dance, film, painting, the
ater, poetry and the countless other
forms that I can't possibly list here
—we have always turned to the
arts to inspire, to comfort, to heal,
to entertain and to reflect.
Yet in our pressure-packed soci
ety (and the hecticness of the quar
ter system), it's easy to get over
whelmed and forget about the arts.
But look around you, and you'll see
that Stanford is in the middle of an
arts transformation. The stunning
new Bing Concert Hall opened last
year, celebrating its first birthday
earlier this month. The Anderson
Collection at Cantor Arts Center
will be opening later this year, with
a new home for the Art and Art
History department coming soon
after. New arts-intensive programs
for undergraduates (ITALIC, I'm
looking at you) are thriving.
Every day, there are countless
performances by world-class
artists and Stanford students, and
the two categories not mutually ex
clusive. All around campus, there is
a resurgence in the arts, with The
Economist even going so far as to
call Stanford "a Florence for the
21st century" in an article earlier
this month.
Despite this rebirth, paradoxi
cally, the arts at Stanford remain
latent at times, often overshadowed
and overlooked by a populace that
is seemingly perpetually over
whelmed and inundated with aca
demics, athletics, work and ex
tracurriculars. I, too, fall in that
category even as someone who's

actively involved in the music scene
here, playing in the Stanford Sym
phony Orchestra, I have to perpet
ually remind myself to make time
to explore and appreciate the diver
sity of artistic performances and
showcases at Stanford from across
the breadth of the arts.
While disparate, these fields of
the arts are united by their explo
ration and evocation of emotions
through various mediums, and I've
been surprised at what I've discov
ered, even in artistic genres that I
normally wouldn't attend. I've
found myself intellectually stimu
lated by contemporary art at Can
tor, captivated by dance perform
ances out in White Plaza and im
mersed in a full audiovisual produc
tion with 3-D images and electronic
music at Bing. Of course, I've also
attended (and performed in) count
less performances in my "home"
genre of classical music, always en
joying the amazing musical experi
ences that these performances pro
vide.
Hopefully my experiences with
the arts at Stanford are not unique.
However, if you haven't had a
chance to indulge your artistic side
yet, now is an opportune time to do
so.
Go to an orchestra concert,
where you might be moved by the
lush melodies of Mahler, or stroll
the galleries at Cantor and discover
some unexpected art. Watch a
friend perform in a musical or en
tertain yourself by watching a stu
dent-produced film. Explore and
dive into various genres of the arts
and see if anything catches your
eye (and ear). Perhaps staring at gi
gantic red steel beams won't elicit
the same emotions for you as it did
for me, but in the middle of this
artistic renaissance at Stanford,
let's all really take a moment to
stop and appreciate the arts. Let's
make 2014 the year of the arts at
Stanford.

Go to an orchestra concert,
where you might be moved by the
lush melodies of Mahler, or stroll
the galleries at Cantor and discover
some unexpected art. Watch a
friend perform in a musical or en
tertain yourself by watching a stu

dive into various genres of the arts
and see if anything catches your
eye (and ear). Perhaps staring at gi

the same emotions for you as it did
for me, but in the middle of this

It takes a lot for something to
catch my attention when I'm
biking, and it takes an especial
ly striking scene to cause me to pull
over and dismount. Both of those
were accomplished last week,
though, when I was biking on Es
condido Road towards Meyer Li
brary. A huge red steel structure
which most certainly hadn't been
there before winter break arose
out of the foggy mist, intriguing me
with its weaving lines, all seeming
ly converging at a singular space.
It turned out that the aforemen
tioned structure ( The Sieve of
Eratosthenes, a sign informed
me) was a sculpture, a part of the
University's outdoor art collection.
Yet despite its mysterious appear
ance, the sculpture had accom
plished its goal it had caused me
to stop, ponder its meaning and ad
mire its gleaming outline in the set
ting sun.
For me, that one ephemeral mo
ment was poignant, a tribute to the
power of the arts. How else could
an assembly of steel beams, which
was in all practical senses useless,
trigger such a wave of emotion?
This is the magic of the arts: no
matter the art form sculpture,
music, dance, film, painting, the
ater, poetry and the countless other
forms that I can't possibly list here
—we have always turned to the
arts to inspire, to comfort, to heal,
to entertain and to reflect.
Yet in our pressure-packed soci
ety (and the hecticness of the quar
ter system), it's easy to get over
whelmed and forget about the arts.
But look around you, and you'll see
that Stanford is in the middle of an
arts transformation. The stunning
new Bing Concert Hall opened last
year, celebrating its first birthday
earlier this month. The Anderson
Collection at Cantor Arts Center
will be opening later this year, with
a new home for the Art and Art
History department coming soon
after. New arts-intensive programs
for undergraduates (ITALIC, I'm
looking at you) are thriving.
Every day, there are countless
performances by world-class
artists and Stanford students, and
the two categories not mutually ex
clusive. All around campus, there is
a resurgence in the arts, with The
Economist even going so far as to
call Stanford "a Florence for the
21st century" in an article earlier
this month.
Despite this rebirth, paradoxi
cally, the arts at Stanford remain
latent at times, often overshadowed
and overlooked by a populace that
is seemingly perpetually over
whelmed and inundated with aca
demics, athletics, work and ex
tracurriculars. I, too, fall in that
category even as someone who's

actively involved in the music scene
here, playing in the Stanford Sym
phony Orchestra, I have to perpet
ually remind myself to make time
to explore and appreciate the diver
sity of artistic performances and
showcases at Stanford from across
the breadth of the arts.
While disparate, these fields of
the arts are united by their explo
ration and evocation of emotions
through various mediums, and I've
been surprised at what I've discov
ered, even in artistic genres that I
normally wouldn't attend. I've
found myself intellectually stimu
lated by contemporary art at Can
tor, captivated by dance perform
ances out in White Plaza and im
mersed in a full audiovisual produc
tion with 3-D images and electronic
music at Bing. Of course, I've also
attended (and performed in) count
less performances in my "home"
genre of classical music, always en
joying the amazing musical experi
ences that these performances pro
vide.
Hopefully my experiences with
the arts at Stanford are not unique.
However, if you haven't had a
chance to indulge your artistic side
yet, now is an opportune time to do
so.
