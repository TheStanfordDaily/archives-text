# LETTER TO THE EDITOR
## 
### 
Last week, we were invited to
participate in a first-of-its
kind collaboration focused on
making college athletics more in
clusive and welcoming for LGBT
athletes and coaches. What made
this series of events, called "We
A.R.E. (Athletes Reaching Equali
ty) Pride" unique is that it was a
joint effort between Stanford and
Cal's Athletic Departments.
Specifically, Mikayla Lyles, a
senior on the Cal women's basket
ball team, and Toni Kokenis, a sen
ior on the Stanford women's bas
ketball team, came together to plan
a series of events during Rivals
Week when the two team play each
other twice. Having these events
occur during Rivals Week high
lights the power of rivals joining
forces to help educate players,
coaches, administrators and fans
about the importance of creating
welcoming and inclusive environ
ments in sports.
The program included our panel
at both the Cal and Stanford cam
puses, where more than 100 audi
ence members attended each panel.
In addition to the panel, we de
buted several video montages and
films highlighting the importance
of LGBT athletes being fully ac
cepted and celebrated by their
teams, coaches and schools, while
expressing how equally important
the deleterious impact of silence for
such athletes can be.
One particularly moving ele
ment of the program was the photo
exhibit, which displayed photos of
Cal and Stanford athletes together
that embodied the spirit of inclu
sion. Stanford also hosted a High
School Inclusion workshop and a
Youth Teamwork Clinic, recogniz
ing the importance of getting to
morrow's college athletes, coaches
and fans involved in these efforts
before they get to college.

Athletes and coaches often de
scribe their teammates as a second
family one in which team mem
bers and coaches have each other's
backs on and off the court or play
ing field. In an impressive display
of this value, the entire Cal
women's basketball team and
coaching staff attended the panel at
Cal to support their teammate
Mikayla wbo, with Toni, spoke as
part of panels on both campuses. In
addition, Cal Athletic Director,
Sandy Barbour, attended the Cal
panel. The presence of the entire
Cal women's team, coaching staff,
athletic director and other athletic
staff was a tangible expression of
Cal Athletics' commitment to inclu
sion, as well as an expression of
personal support for Mikayla. It
was teamwork at its best.
Thank you to Mikayla and Toni
for inviting us to participate in this
collaborative effort. Each of us
speaks at schools across the country
on LGBT inclusion in athletics. This
unique collaborative series of events
and the support of the Cal athletic
community, in particular, give us
hope for the future and the ways
that the current generation of stu
dent-athletes is changing sports to
create more inclusive climates for
athletes and coaches of all sexual
orientations and gender identities.
