# Wanted: A Foreign Policy
## 
### James Bradbury 
A decade ago, as the initial cam
paign of "shock and awe" in
Iraq drew to a close and
Afghanistan prepared for its first
post-invasion elections, President
George W Bush used a speech at the
National Endowment for Democra
cy to lay out a radical new American
foreign policy. He announced that
"the United States has adopted... a
forward strategy of freedom in the
Middle East" and that "the advance
of freedom...is the calling of our
country."
After the speech, support for
what Bush called "the global wave of
democracy" was now national policy,
even in parts of the world where
America had long supported dicta
tors in the interests of Cold War
strategic advantage or regional po
litical stability. But after featuring in
a few more years of speeches, this
so-called "freedom agenda" faded
from view, remaining in the Ameri
can political consciousness only as a
target of derision, as its most promi
nent manifestations the "nation
building" projects in Afghanistan
and Iraq were condemned do
mestically and internationally as im
perialist, misguided or simply as
failures.
But we've never quite walked it
back (though Bush himself stopped
trumpeting it when the Palestinian
election he held up as the best hope
for peace ended up bringing Hamas
to power in Gaza). Indeed, the free
dom agenda is now taken for grant
ed by most observers of American
foreign policy, and it's hard to imag
ine it any other way: Whenever and
wherever a political dispute pits
democracy against its opponents,
the United States stands with the
democrats.
George Bush's world was close
enough to the Cold War that he
could import from it a prepackaged

conception of freedom, that which
once separated the "free world"
from the Soviet bloc. It seemed rea
sonable at the time to enumerate
those differences, as Bush did in his
speech, and call it a day: limited
state and military authority, inde
pendent judiciary and rule of law,
religious freedom and freedom of
press and assembly and of course
a capitalist economy, all within a
framework of electoral democracy.
But with Cold War blinders
mostly lifted, it has become clear
that the distinctions Bush drew
weren't subtle enough.
Instead, it's obvious from events
of the past three years that these in
complete conceptions of freedom
and democracy simply don't get us
very far when it comes to choosing a
side in all but the most clear-cut of
political disputes.
So we vacillated for weeks in
January and February 2011 over
whether to call for Hosni Mubarak
to step down. Mubarak himself was
unlikely to run for president again
(though his son probably would) and
Egypt's multiparty politics, if not
fully open, were more than just a
fagade but the protesters, after
all, were chanting for democracy
and calling for just the freedoms we
wanted to promote.
We quickly accepted the victory
of the Muslim Brotherhood's Mo
hamed Morsi in the 2012 presiden
tial elections, but were never quite
sure what to make of the wide
spread view, now held by most
Egyptians, that the freely and fairly
elected President Morsi had be
trayed democracy and deserved to
be ousted a year later by the mili
tary, acting at the behest of nation
wide street protests.
Thus we are left to plead the case
of the small minority of Egyptians
who oppose both the Muslim Broth

erhood and the coup that ousted its
president.
We stand tentatively with
Ukrainian protesters, some of
whom are extreme nationalists,
even anti-Semites; if President Vik
tor Yanukovych were to change his
mind and accept a Western rather
than Russian bailout we would like
ly stand with him instead after
all, he, too, was democratically elect
ed.
In Thailand we support the gov
ernment of caretaker Prime Minis
ter Yingluck Shinawatra, rather
than a pro-Western and pro-busi
ness protest movement (led by for
mer Democrat Party politician
Suthep Thaugsuban) that argues
that PM Yingluck has betrayed
democracy.
I strongly support all three of
these stances. I think that in each
case our country's foreign policy ap
paratus has come to the right deci
sion based on a deep understanding
of political and historical context
and an unarticulated but real sense
of American values that follows
through where Bush left off.
But it is absolutely vital that our
government find away to articulate
that sense, because the right foreign
policy will never be enough if its mo
tivations are opaque. While the
transparency of the original free
dom agenda was overshadowed by a
flawed and incomplete policy, it has
still transformed the world: If all
goes well, this spring may see the
first peaceful and democratic trans
fers of power in both Afghanistan
and Iraq. A foreign policy of values
over interests is here to stay. We
lack only a leadership that will stand
up to articulate, clarify and defend
it.

from the Soviet bloc. It seemed rea
sonable at the time to enumerate
those differences, as Bush did in his
speech, and call it a day: limited
state and military authority, inde
pendent judiciary and rule of law,
religious freedom and freedom of
press and assembly and of course
a capitalist economy, all within a
framework of electoral democracy.
But with Cold War blinders
mostly lifted, it has become clear
that the distinctions Bush drew
weren't subtle enough.
Instead, it's obvious from events
of the past three years that these in
complete conceptions of freedom
and democracy simply don't get us
very far when it comes to choosing a
side in all but the most clear-cut of
political disputes.
So we vacillated for weeks in
January and February 2011 over
whether to call for Hosni Mubarak
to step down. Mubarak himself was
unlikely to run for president again
(though his son probably would) and
Egypt's multiparty politics, if not
fully open, were more than just a
fagade but the protesters, after
all, were chanting for democracy
and calling for just the freedoms we
wanted to promote.
We quickly accepted the victory
of the Muslim Brotherhood's Mo
hamed Morsi in the 2012 presiden
tial elections, but were never quite
sure what to make of the wide
spread view, now held by most
Egyptians, that the freely and fairly
elected President Morsi had be
trayed democracy and deserved to
be ousted a year later by the mili
tary, acting at the behest of nation
wide street protests.
Thus we are left to plead the case
of the small minority of Egyptians
who oppose both the Muslim Broth

erhood and the coup that ousted its
president.
We stand tentatively with
Ukrainian protesters, some of
whom are extreme nationalists,
even anti-Semites; if President Vik
tor Yanukovych were to change his
mind and accept a Western rather
than Russian bailout we would like
ly stand with him instead after
all, he, too, was democratically elect
ed.
In Thailand we support the gov
ernment of caretaker Prime Minis
ter Yingluck Shinawatra, rather
than a pro-Western and pro-busi
ness protest movement (led by for
mer Democrat Party politician
Suthep Thaugsuban) that argues
that PM Yingluck has betrayed
democracy.
I strongly support all three of
these stances. I think that in each
case our country's foreign policy ap
paratus has come to the right deci
sion based on a deep understanding
of political and historical context
and an unarticulated but real sense
of American values that follows
through where Bush left off.
But it is absolutely vital that our
government find away to articulate
that sense, because the right foreign
policy will never be enough if its mo
tivations are opaque. While the
transparency of the original free
dom agenda was overshadowed by a
flawed and incomplete policy, it has
still transformed the world: If all
goes well, this spring may see the
first peaceful and democratic trans
fers of power in both Afghanistan
and Iraq. A foreign policy of values
over interests is here to stay. We
lack only a leadership that will stand
up to articulate, clarify and defend
it.

A decade ago, as the initial cam
paign of "shock and awe" in
Iraq drew to a close and
Afghanistan prepared for its first
post-invasion elections, President
George W Bush used a speech at the
National Endowment for Democra
cy to lay out a radical new American
foreign policy. He announced that
"the United States has adopted... a
forward strategy of freedom in the
Middle East" and that "the advance
of freedom...is the calling of our
country."
After the speech, support for
what Bush called "the global wave of
democracy" was now national policy,
even in parts of the world where
America had long supported dicta
tors in the interests of Cold War
strategic advantage or regional po
litical stability. But after featuring in
a few more years of speeches, this
so-called "freedom agenda" faded
from view, remaining in the Ameri
can political consciousness only as a
target of derision, as its most promi
nent manifestations the "nation
building" projects in Afghanistan
and Iraq were condemned do
mestically and internationally as im
perialist, misguided or simply as
failures.
But we've never quite walked it
back (though Bush himself stopped
trumpeting it when the Palestinian
election he held up as the best hope
for peace ended up bringing Hamas
to power in Gaza). Indeed, the free
dom agenda is now taken for grant
ed by most observers of American
foreign policy, and it's hard to imag
ine it any other way: Whenever and
wherever a political dispute pits
democracy against its opponents,
the United States stands with the
democrats.
George Bush's world was close
enough to the Cold War that he
could import from it a prepackaged

conception of freedom, that which
once separated the "free world"
from the Soviet bloc. It seemed rea
sonable at the time to enumerate
those differences, as Bush did in his
speech, and call it a day: limited
state and military authority, inde
pendent judiciary and rule of law,
religious freedom and freedom of
press and assembly and of course
a capitalist economy, all within a
