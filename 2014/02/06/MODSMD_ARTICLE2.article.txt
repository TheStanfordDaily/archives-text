## FLIP tackles issues of class identity Second annual "Class Confessions" event aims to feature Stanford's socio-economic diversity 
### VANESSA OCHAVILLO DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Since 2004, the First-Generation Low Income Partner
ship (FLIP), a student-led organization on campus, has
sought to tackle one of the most sensitive issues facing the
minority of students coming from low-income back
grounds and entering Stanford as the first in their families
to get a college education socio-economic class.
The group has recently launched efforts, however, to
bring the discussion of class identity to the majority of stu
dents that do not identify as either first-generation or low
income. Erica McDowell 'l6, FLIP'S external community
coordinator, said that she considers herself to be neither
first-generation nor low-income and noted that discussing
class issues can be hard for many students from a similar

year, reflecting the group's efforts to encourage students
to discuss complex socio-economic issues.
background.
"Everyone has a complex
story about class," McDowell
said. "There are people who
want to 'engage in the con
versation' about class but
feel uncomfortable doing so.
I think wealthy people tend
to be afraid to come out as
wealthy or to identify that
way because there's so much
stigma against wealthy peo
ple in this nation and the
power they have wielded
with their wealth."
Holly Fetter 'l3 M.A. 'l4,
who identifies as coming
from an affluent background,
said that she started to be
come more aware of her class
privilege in her junior year
and joined the FLIP leader
ship team as an external
community coordinator.
"I was becoming cog
nizant 0f... how I could use
my unique perspective to
speak out about classism and
economic inequality," Fetter
said, adding that she wanted
to enhance FLIP'S communi

ty by facilitating the creation
of opportunities for cross
class conversations.
That awareness led to the
production of a "Class Con
fessions" event last year, to
which participants were able
to anonymously submit a sit
uation where they kept then*
socio-economic status a se
cret. The submissions, which
were posted on a Tumblr
page, varied widely.
"I laughed along with the
group when someone men
tioned how crazy it is that
they are paying $50,000 a
year to get a good educa
tion," one read. "For me and
my family, paying a tenth of
that a year is hard."
"I use my knowledge
about financial aid to pretend
that I receive it when talking
to friends and acquaintanc
es," another stated.
While FLIP initially wor
ried about event attendance
as well as potential backlash,
according to Fetter, "Class
Confessions" proved to be a
success and also drew the at
tention of universities
around the country, including
Northwestern and the Uni
versity of Chicago.
Though FLIP's leaders

are proud of the community
they've fostered, mitigating
class issues for anyone be
longing to any socio-econom
ic background is a continuous
process, said Najla Gomez
'l4, FLIP's co-president.
"I think Stanford does a
very good job at sort of shad
owing over class differ
ences," Gomez said. "The
housing situation, the dining
hall situation everything
gets sort of established in
away that you can't tell who
is who and what [one's] class
background [is], which
makes it sometimes alienat
ing and isolating for stu
dents."
According to McDowell,
the second "Class Confes
sions" event will aim to be
more inclusive and by ac
knowledging middle-class
perspectives in addition to
those of affluent or low-in
come individuals less bi
nary.
"This year we're trying to
make it a more open space
for people who lie in all parts
of the class identity spec
trum," McDowell said.
