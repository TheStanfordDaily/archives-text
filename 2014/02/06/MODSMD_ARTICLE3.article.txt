## Bloomberg News' Winkler talks data 
### EDWARD NGAI DESK EDITOR 
In a presentation on Wednesday afternoon, Bloomberg
News co-founder and editor-in-chief Matthew Winkler re
peatedly emphasized the foundation of the financial news gi
ant's success: data. The hour-long talk, part of a weekly
speaker series for Communications graduate students, was
also live-streamed on the class's website.
Before "data-driven" anything was a übiquitous buz
zphrase all the way back in 1990, according to Winkler
Bloomberg came to use data in what were then groundbreak
ing ways. At that time, bankers who wanted to compare the
relative worth of securities had to sift through stacks of news
papers or call a personal source. An early version of
Bloomberg simply collected a database of securities over
time and packaged it neatly for bankers.
Winkler, who was then a reporter for the Wall Street Jour
nal, immediately saw value in the product.
"Even though Bloomberg was just data points, it was at
least three or four weeks ahead of my columns," he said.
Earlier forms of Bloomberg bridged a number of prac
tices, according to Winkler, including operating as a software
company, a hardware company, a utility and a content compa
ny all at the same time.
"Eight years after it was born, we decided it would be
come a news company," he continued, referencing his collab
oration with Michael Bloomberg on the creation of
Bloomberg News.
In a brief question and answer period, Winkler touched
briefly on some of the press
ing issues facing business
journalism and the industry
as a whole. Asked about the
way Western media should
respond to the expulsion of
journalists from China, includ
ing those from Bloomberg,
Winkler demurred from an
swering directly but acknowl
edged that media organiza
tions sometimes have to work
in inhospitable political cir
cumstances.

"We're not, in any location,
going in with the sole purpose
of challenging the govern
ment or authority," he said.
"We're not going to be the
ones to change the world that
way. We're going to change
the world by illuminating
events and reporting on is
sues."
That style of journalism
paid dividends for Bloomberg
News just this past week,
with old-school journalism
leading to the firm breaking
and then leading coverage of
Satya Nadella's rise to Mi
crosoft CEO.
Winkler noted, however,
that there is more to
Bloomberg journalism than
diligence and accuracy
"[lt] comes back to some
one who is very familiar, very
prepared, used to using data,"
he said.
