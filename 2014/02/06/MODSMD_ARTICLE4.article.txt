# Wilbur alcohol transports rise
## Six freshmen residents transported during fall quarter 
### CALEB SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Wilbur Hall experienced its highest
number of alcohol transports during a
quarter in over a year this past fall, ac
cording to University figures.
Six Wilbur residents were transport
ed due to alcohol consumption last quar
ter, according to Office of Alcohol Policy
and Education (OAPE) director Ralph
Castro. The complex experienced zero,
two and two transports during fall, win
ter and spring quarters, respectively, of
the 2012-13 academic year.
Castro and Dean of Residential Edu
cation (ResEd) Deborah Golder framed
the uptick as potentially reflecting a
greater willingness by students to re
port problems and ask for help, a per
spective echoed by some Wilbur student
staff members.
Castro also noted that more incoming
freshmen reported having drunk in high
school and having high-risk drinking
patterns before arriving at Stanford.
The rise in transports from Wilbur
which Castro described as predominant
ly involving hard liquor wasn't echoed
elsewhere on campus, however, with
Stern Hall another freshman resi
dence experiencing a constant five al
cohol transports in fall quarter of both
2012 and 2013.

According to multiple Wilbur staff
members, OAPE and Wilbur resident
assistants (RAs) met at the end of last
quarter to discuss the increase.
"We were all a little shocked by the
numbers this year," said one Wilbur staff
member who asked to remain anony
mous.

However, Castro and Golder cau
tioned against drawing excessive signifi
cance from one quarter's figures.
"Zero transports in the fall [of 2012]
was an anomaly more than anything,"
Golder said.
