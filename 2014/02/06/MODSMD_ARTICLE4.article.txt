# Wilbur alcohol transports rise
## Six freshmen residents transported during fall quarter 
### CALEB SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Wilbur Hall experienced its highest
number of alcohol transports during a
quarter in over a year this past fall, ac
cording to University figures.
Six Wilbur residents were transport
ed due to alcohol consumption last quar
ter, according to Office of Alcohol Policy
and Education (OAPE) director Ralph
Castro. The complex experienced zero,
two and two transports during fall, win
ter and spring quarters, respectively, of
the 2012-13 academic year.
Castro and Dean of Residential Edu
cation (ResEd) Deborah Golder framed
the uptick as potentially reflecting a
greater willingness by students to re
port problems and ask for help, a per
spective echoed by some Wilbur student
staff members.
Castro also noted that more incoming
freshmen reported having drunk in high
school and having high-risk drinking
patterns before arriving at Stanford.
The rise in transports from Wilbur
which Castro described as predominant
ly involving hard liquor wasn't echoed
elsewhere on campus, however, with
Stern Hall another freshman resi
dence experiencing a constant five al
cohol transports in fall quarter of both
2012 and 2013.

According to multiple Wilbur staff
members, OAPE and Wilbur resident
assistants (RAs) met at the end of last
quarter to discuss the increase.
"We were all a little shocked by the
numbers this year," said one Wilbur staff
member who asked to remain anony
mous.

However, Castro and Golder cau
tioned against drawing excessive signifi
cance from one quarter's figures.
"Zero transports in the fall [of 2012]
was an anomaly more than anything,"
Golder said.

Golder framed her objective re
garding alcohol transports as re
ducing the need for alcohol trans
ports, not the actual number of
transports reported. She cited the
importance of dorm-level efforts to
stop unsafe drinking.
"If it's around alcohol, we want
it to be happening locally," Golder
said of efforts to prevent dangerous
alcohol consumption.
Golder also emphasized that
ResEd was most interested in stu
dent safety.
"We're not vilifying alcohol, we

just want people to be safe in their
choices," Golder said.
OAPE and ResEd have contin
ued earlier efforts to discourage un
safe drinking habits, including an
initiative started last year to stan
dardize alcohol policies across the
eight houses in Wilbur Hall.
While several Wilbur staff mem
bers said that they felt well-sup
ported by ResEd in terms of foster
ing safe drinking environments,
some expressed concern with
OAPE's efforts to promote safe
drinking and claimed that OAPE's
"social zone" outreach talk, which
was intended to promote safe
drinking habits, had backfired.
"All of our residents who had
chosen not to drink before decided
to drink," said one Wilbur student

staff member who also chose to re
main anonymous.
Another Wilbur staff member,
who did not want to be named, crit
icized OAPE's "cookie-cutter" ap
proach to dealing with drinking, cit
ing the social zone talk as an exam
ple.
Wilbur staff members, for their
part, said they have taken various
measures to prevent future drink
ing problems, including simple
measures like fostering community
bonding by getting the dorms to eat
meals together and even practicing
a system whereby the entire dor
m's staff was on call each night,
rather than a single RA.
