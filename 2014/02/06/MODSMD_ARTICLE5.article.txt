## Hack culture at Stanford lags behind 
### NATHANIEL OKUN 
Despite Stanford's technological pedi
gree, hacking culture on campus has
struggled to keep pace with the constant
output of coders and startups, according
to students active in the scene.
"Stanford is much more focused on
entrepreneurship," said Karthik
Viswanathan 'l5, president of the Stan
ford Association for Computing Machin
ery (ACM). "A lot of people are just inter
ested in building products that will make
a lot of money."
Contrary to popular belief, hacking
a sometimes-misleading label that belies

the activity's creative implications is
actually the general term for building
software or hardware outside a class
room environment.
"Hacking is building something be
cause you love to build," Viswanathan ex
plained.
Viswanathan framed hacking as es
sential to the process of becoming a truly
effective programmer, given the inherent
opportunity for participants to learn
about the tools currently used in the
computer science industry.
Mike Swift, the founder of Hacker
League and commissioner of Major
League Hacks, echoed Viswanathan's

sentiments. While he acknowledged the
value of academic coursework, Swift ar
gued that learning must also happen out
side the classroom.
"[Computer science] is not the one
size-fits-all answer for being a program
mer," Swift said. "We have all these re
sources out there like hackathons and
hacker spaces and learn-to-code pro
grams that can supplement what you're
learning... Hacking may not even touch
on computer science."

scribed hackathons as one of
the best places for program
mers to begin to explore the
full potential of programming.
Hackathons are typically 24-
or 36-houi' marathon coding
events with attendance rang
ing from a few dozen coders to
over a thousand.
"Hackathons are all about
taking a cool idea or technol
ogy and learning how to
build it," said Rahul Gupta-
Iwasaki 'l4, a computer sci
ence major and ACM officer.
"All it takes is [that] you want
to do something and your
creativity."
Hackathons are hosted on
many college campuses
across the nation. This year,
three students from the Cali
fornia Institute of Technology
(Caltech) inaugurated hack-
TECH, which attracted over
1,500 hackers en route to be
coming the largest hackathon
on the west coast yet.

Shubji Jain, one of the co
founders of hackTECH, ex
plained his enthusiasm for
the marathon coding ses
sions by emphasizing both
the learning and social as
pects.
"I learned so much. I met
awesome people," Jain said.
"And although the thing that
I created didn't end up work
ing perfectly, at the end of
the day what I took away as
an experience was phenome
nal."
Back on campus, Stan
ford ACM has made the de
velopment of a hacking com
munity one of the associa
tion's main goals. The club
currently hosts bi-annual
hackathons, and the spring
competition, "The Big
Hack," pits Stanford against
its perennial rival, UC
Berkeley. In addition, ACM
holds frequent workshops
designed to bridge the gap
between industry and the
classroom.
Viswanathan noted an in
creasing interest in hacking
at Stanford compared to ear
lier years.

"I remember back in
freshman year when I joined
[ACM], we would get very
low turnouts to everything,"
Viswanathan explained.
"Nowadays we're getting a
constant 50 [students] at
everything we hold."
However, the group still
faces considerable obstacles.
According to Gupta-Iwasaki,
students often shy away
from hacking, ruling them
selves out due to a perceived
lack of experience even as
that deficit makes participat
ing in hacker culture even
more important.
"When I went to my first
hackathon, I also had very
little web experience, very
little mobile experience,"
Gupta-Iwasaki said. "But
that was where I learned."
He acknowledged that
making the leap from class to
the unknown is difficult.
"We need to do a better
job of making people feel
comfortable with that uncer
tainty," Gupta-Iwasaki said.
