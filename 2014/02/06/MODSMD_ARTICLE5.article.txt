## Hack culture at Stanford lags behind 
### NATHANIEL OKUN 
Despite Stanford's technological pedi
gree, hacking culture on campus has
struggled to keep pace with the constant
output of coders and startups, according
to students active in the scene.
"Stanford is much more focused on
entrepreneurship," said Karthik
Viswanathan 'l5, president of the Stan
ford Association for Computing Machin
ery (ACM). "A lot of people are just inter
ested in building products that will make
a lot of money."
Contrary to popular belief, hacking
a sometimes-misleading label that belies

the activity's creative implications is
actually the general term for building
software or hardware outside a class
room environment.
"Hacking is building something be
cause you love to build," Viswanathan ex
plained.
Viswanathan framed hacking as es
sential to the process of becoming a truly
effective programmer, given the inherent
opportunity for participants to learn
about the tools currently used in the
computer science industry.
Mike Swift, the founder of Hacker
League and commissioner of Major
League Hacks, echoed Viswanathan's

sentiments. While he acknowledged the
value of academic coursework, Swift ar
gued that learning must also happen out
side the classroom.
"[Computer science] is not the one
size-fits-all answer for being a program
mer," Swift said. "We have all these re
sources out there like hackathons and
hacker spaces and learn-to-code pro
grams that can supplement what you're
learning... Hacking may not even touch
on computer science."
Both Swift and Yiswanathan de
scribed hackathons as one of the best

Rift to create a video game for hackTECH, the largest West Coast hackathon to date. Over 1,500 hackers attended.
