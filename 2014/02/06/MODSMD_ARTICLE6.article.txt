# Signing Day Success
## Stanford adds 20 players in 2014 recruiting class 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Wednesday was a good day to
be a Cardinal fan.
Stanford football finalized its
2014 recruiting class by securing
the commitments of 20 high
school football players on Nation
al Signing Day, including two top
recruits who were previously un
decided before announcing their
intentions on Signing Day. Stan
ford's recruiting class now ranks
14th in the nation and second in
the Pac-12 to USC according to
Rivals.com, which makes it Stan

ford's second-best recruiting
class since former head coach Jim
Harbaugh arrived in 2007 be
hind only the class of 2012.
"As usual, the 2014 Stanford
class starts up front," said Stan
ford head coach David Shaw. "We
added four big, physical and ath
letic offensive linemen, the best
all-around tight end in the nation,
two penetrating defensive line
men and one of the most athletic
and versatile linebacker classes in
the country. This year's class of
defensive backs is also compara
ble to the most athletic groups in
the nation. Our skill positions on

offense have both toughness and
game-changing speed, and it also
helps to add the number-one
quarterback in the class."
Scout.com five-star defensive
end Solomon Thomas, the No. 20
overall prospect, committed to
Stanford live on ESPNU around
5:10 a.m. PST to begin an event
ful day for the Cardinal. Thomas
is the highest-ranked Cardinal
recruit from Texas since Stanford
signed Andrew Luck 'l2 in 2008,

Twenty high school seniors signed National Letters of Intent to the Stanford
football program on Wednesday. Highlighted by quarterback Keller Chryst
and defensive end Solomon Thomas, the group is ranked 14th in the nation.
Tex., chose Stanford over
Arkansas, where his sister
goes to school, and UCLA.
"He's a complete player, a
guy that likes to be a techni
cian," said defensive line
coach Randy Hart about
Thomas. "He has a great mo
tor and has the ability to be a
great football player."
Later in the day,
Scout.com three-star corner
back Terrence Alexander also
announced his intentions to
sign with Stanford on ESP
NU around 7:30 a.m. Pacific
Time. Alexander picked Stan
ford over Notre Dame.
"We were amazed at how
much of a natural cover cor
ner he is, but at the same time
he is a tough, physical kid,"
said defensive coordinator
Lance Anderson about
Alexander.
Some of the other key re
cruits who officially signed
their letters of intent on
Wednesday after having pre
viously committed to Stan
ford included four-star quar
terback Keller Chryst, five
star offensive tackle Casey
Tucker and four-star tight
end Dalton Schultz, who
each ranked in the top-five
recruits at their respective
positions, according to
Scout.com.
Chryst, a product of Palo
Alto High School, announced
his intentions to sign with
Stanford back in June.
Chryst is the highest-ranked
quarterback to commit to
Stanford since Andrew Luck
in 2008. Alabama and USC,
among other schools, re
cruited Chryst before he de
cided to commit to Stanford.
Tucker could become
Stanford's most prized re
cruit from this recruiting
class for several reasons.
The 6-foot-6, 290-pound
tackle from Chandler, Ariz.,

ranks 22nd in Scout.com's
prospect rankings and origi
nally committed to USC be
fore de-committing in April.
He then declared his inten
tion to sign with the Cardinal
in January.
Stanford's tradition of
producing talented tight
ends should continue with
the commitment of the na
tion's top tight end, Dalton
Schultz. Schultz, who hails
from Bingham, Utah, brings
his 6-foot-5,230-pound frame
to the Cardinal and could po
tentially see playing time as
early as his freshman year.
"Dalton is a kid that all
the recruiting services had
as the number-one tight end
in America," said offensive
coordinator Mike Bloom
gren. "When we evaluate
kids and put them on our
board, sometimes we are go
ing to agree with them and
sometimes we are not. In
Dalton's case, we absolutely
did."
The offensive line re
ceived added depth with
Stanford signing Scout.com
three-star tackle Reilly Gib
bons, three-star guard Jesse
Burkett and three-star guard
Austin Hall in addition to
Tucker. Gibbons, a native of
St. Petersburg, Fla., had pre
viously verbally committed to
Miami (FL) before he
changed his mind and com
mitted to Stanford earlier
this week.
The defensive front seven
should be greatly strength
ened by the numerous play
ers on the defensive line and
the linebacking corps in the
new recruiting class.
Scout.com four-star line
backer Joey Alfieri, four-star
linebacker Bobby Okereke
and three-star linebacker
Jordan Perez all signed their
letters of intent to play for

the Cardinal and will boost a
group that is losing stars in
fifth-year seniors Shayne
Skov and Trent Murphy.
Three-star defensive ends
Harrison Phillips and Lane
Veach pair with Thomas to
form a dynamic defensive
line class as well.
Stanford's backfield
gained three new contribu
tors in four-star running
back Christian McCaffrey,
three-star running back Isa
iah Brandt-Sims and three
star fullback Daniel Marx.
McCaffrey, the 16th-ranked
running back according to
Scout.com and son of former
Cardinal wide receiver Ed
McCaffrey '9l, was also re
cruited by Florida State,
Ohio State and Oregon and
brings his quickness and
agility to the Cardinal. Marx
also played linebacker and
tight end in high school and
elicits comparisons to former
Stanford fullback and line
backer Owen Marecic 'll.
The secondary also im
proved significantly with
Stanford's class of 2014, as
Scout.com four-star safety
Brandon Simmons, three
star safety Denzel Franklin
and three-star cornerbacks
Alijah Holder and Alameen
Murphy signed their letters
of intent to play for Stanford
in addition to Alexander.
Simmons, an Arlington, Tex.
native and the 15th-ranked
safety in the nation, was the
first recruit to announce his
intention to sign with the
Cardinal back in April 2013.
Overall, Stanford's re
cruiting class consists of
players from every position
group other than wide receiv
er and from 12 different
states across the nation.
