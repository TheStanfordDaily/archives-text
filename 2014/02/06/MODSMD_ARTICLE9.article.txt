## Loving the sport and being a fan 
### Do-Hyoung Park 
The first-ever sports game
that I attended was a Ko
rea Baseball Organiza
tion game in Seoul as a
one-year-old child. Leg
end has it that infant me enjoyed the
game in the only way that I knew
how: in the great depths of a pro
found slumber. According to my
mom, she and my dad (along with
maybe 10 other people around
them) had to cheer for their beloved
LG Twins with greatly subdued vo
cal support, lest they risk inciting
the wrath of a developmental Do
torn away from his dreams prema
turely.
Needless to say, my sports fan
dom has come a long way since those
early days. That being said, my path
to fandom diverged significantly
from those of others around the
world. I've always had friends that
have ridden the highest of highs and
sunk to the deepest abysses with the
teams that they support. But I never
really bought into that frenzied,
committed following of a team in the
way that others have, without having
sacrificed my love for sports in the
process. (Granted, when your home
town teams are the Twins, Timber
wolves and Vikings, motivation can
admittedly be tough to find.)
It takes an important quality to
be a diehard fan of a team: You need
to be willing to (irrationally, at
times) buy into the idea that a group
of people on a field playing a game
has the ability to fundamentally
sway your feelings and actions
through competition with another
group of people competition
that ultimately doesn't affect your
everyday life. And enough people
around the world have feverishly
bought into that idea to the point
that the inherent entertainment
value of watching organized
games between two teams has
evolved into something much,
much more transcending the
everyday world in which we live in
the process.
That's why contests like the
Super Bowl draw tens of millions
of viewers every year and sports
icons like Joe DiMaggio, Wayne
Gretzky, Michael Jordan and
Johnny Unitas are adored, glori
fied and forever preserved in his
tory. They compete on a stage that,
to most, is outside of the realm of
fans like them. They're not just
any people, they're professional
athletes. That's why fans strive to
identify with them by wearing
their jerseys and mimicking their
most memorable moments. On the
highest of stages, plastering tele
vision screens around the nation,
they swing the hopes, frustrations
and dreams of people with every
swing of the bat, every punt and
every bicycle kick.
And I think that's where I went
wrong. I never became a true fan
of any team. Instead of giving in to
the dramatic ecstasies and sor
rows that define diehard fans of
teams, I became a fan of the
sports themselves. Instead of ap
plauding the fact that Joe Mauer
doubled to right field and put the
Twins in scoring position, I ap
plauded the idea that the Twins
and Tigers would play a 163 rd
game to decide the final wild-card
spot. I didn't cheer for a brand; I
cheered for moments that I would
remember and skills that I would
respect. Because of that, I was
never as emotionally invested in
the outcomes of games or the suc
cesses of teams, and I feel that
I've been missing out on a critical
element that really defines the ex
perience of a sports fan.
When I first came to Stanford,
I came to the brink of experienc
ing those emotions for the first
time. The Stanford Cardinal stood
for something that defined part of
who I was as a person and stu
dent, and I thought that I could
use the fact that my existence for
four years would intrinsically be
tied to the Stanford brand to elicit
those highs and lows.
And indeed, when Stanford
football upset No. 2 USC last sea
son, I was screaming and jumping
for joy in front of my computer.
When Stanford played Arizona at
home and eked out a 54-48 over
time victory, I experienced the all
consuming dread of, "Oh god,
we're going to lose to Arizona,"
before being overwhelmed by joy
