Cubberley Hall, Stanford University
Free and open to the public
"Myth," says acclaimed storyteller Martin
Shaw, "is not about a long time ago." Created
communally, over time, in full contact with the
natural world, myth is instead a particular
way of understanding ourselves and our world
that offers new routes through the binds of
the modern world. "Poetry," says acclaimed
poet Tony Hoagland, "offers a clarifying force
through its similar use of polymorphic and
enduring images." Together, myth and poetry
understand us in an uncommon way.
In this special evening, Shaw and Hoagland
will weave myth and poetry to reveal how the
deep shapes of their stories give us surprising
ways for meeting the challenges of
contemporary culture. Alongside select
stories and poems, they will talk about the
mysterious wisdom retained in these forms
and how they can help us overcome the
constraints that our culture imposes on our
imaginations. Shaw and Hoagland will also
read and discuss some of the translations of
old Celtic poetry they have been collaborating
on over the last two years.
