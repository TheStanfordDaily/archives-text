Free and open to public
In early 2013, Rob Dunbar, W.M. Keck Professor
of Earth Science, embarked on his latest research
voyage to Antarctica's Southern Ocean, his first
ever as summer turned to an icy and turbulent fall.
He was exploring what happens to the carbon-rich
base of the food chain when seasonal ice forms,
including how much might return to the atmosphere
as carbon dioxide. His earlier research trips focused
on the continent's climate history, explored by
capturing sediment cores from unprecedented depths.
In this special event, Dunbar will discuss his wide
body of research in Antarctica and what it can tell
us about our warming world based on studies of
climates past, present, and future. He traveled with
cameras in hand, and will share exquisite photos
and video that bring his research environments and
processes vividly to life.
