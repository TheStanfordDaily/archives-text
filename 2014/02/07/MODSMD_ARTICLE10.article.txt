# REINVENTING HENRY HIGGINS
## AAIP production of 'My Fair Lady' sells out Bing Concert Hall 
### KATIE STRAUB 
Say the words "My Fair Lady," and one is more
likely to recall images of Audrey Hepburn than ques
tions of race.

The Stanford Asian American Theater Project's
recent production of "My Fair Lady" boldly re-envi
sions the musical, however, by creating an Asian-in
spired version of the show, infusing the musical with
the politics of racial identity. As Ken Savage ' 14's sen
ior project for the Theater and Performance Studies
major, the show deftly transforms the story of "My
Fair Lady" from a quaint tale of maneuvering vowel
sounds to a compelling story of Asian identity forma
tion in the Western world by exploring the cultural
expectations surrounding speech, dress and behavior
and questions of assimilation.
The show, which sold out twice as the first stu
dent production to be shown in Bing Concert Hall,
follows an Asian Henry Higgins and an Asian Eliza
Doolittle in early 20th century London. The charac
ter of Henry Higgins represents the upper-class Eng
lish elite in the traditional version of "My Fair Lady,"
yet in this Asian-inspired production, Henry Higgins

(played by the capable Max Savage 'l6 Ken's
younger brother) is a more complex being. Savage
embodies an Asian man with an elite, wealthy and
Westernized Asian identity, signaled by his beautiful
English dress and high society English dialect, and ful
ly plays out his character as an unapologetically nar
row-minded academic whose quirks we both despise
and love.

Eliza Doolittle (played by Saya Jenks 'l6), repre
sents the opposite end of the identity spectrum in
this show she has a rough Cockney accent and
dirtied clothes to represent a non-elite identity,
which, in contrast to Higgins, held implications of a
poor, non-assimilated, Asian identity. Jenks gave the
audience an intensely animated version of Doolittle,
all groans and squeals, and seemed to be operating in
full gear from start to finish.
As the show unfolds, however, it stays true to
the original script. This was a wise choice on Savage's
part, because the plot, with the addition of a racial
lens, creates intriguing ideological tensions with
every song and scene. When, in the first scene of the


Courtsey of Ken Savage
show, Higgins sang "An Englishman's way of
speaking absolutely classifies him," we could
already hear the lyrics echo with deep cultural
implications based on the world Savage cre
ates. Later, when Higgins bet he could turn
Eliza Doolittle into a "lady," we wondered
what the definition of a lady is, in terms of
cultural expectations for an Asian Eliza. The
audience may have even been nudged to
wards reconsidering the significance and per
haps hidden meaning of the word "fair" in
"My Fair Lady," as it pertains to Asian cultural
norms and Western assimilation.
Yet, perhaps most importantly, Savage
and his creative team refuse to allow for a
strict binary between Western identity and
Eastern identity, high-class and low-class, rich

and poor. Every character in this play seemed
to exist on some sort of cultural identity
spectrum, including the members of the en
semble. There was room for hybridity in
racial identity. Some street vendors wear
Westernized clothing but speak in a Cockney
accent, while some maids in the Higgins
household maintain an elite British dialect
but dress in traditionally Eastern attire
the combinations are seemingly endless.
Also vital to this process is the excellent
costume and set design, done by the talented
Asia Chao 'l5. Higgins' home is decorated in
swatches of red and yellow seemingly orien
tal patterns, and a recognizable icon of East
meets-West vase of blue and white Chi
nese porcelain —is seen in almost every

scene of the show. And speaking of blue and
white, the costumes featured in "Ascot
Gavotte" (my favorite scene in the show) are
positively lavish English-style gowns, hats,
suits, canes, parasols and the like. Yet, these
Western modes of dress are done entirely in
blue and white as an explicit nod to Chinese
porcelain (as well as a brilliant play on the
original black and white from the 1964 film).
The ensemble shows their abilities vocally
and physically during this scene, nailing the
stylized crispness and haughty atmosphere of
a day at the races in British high society.
Standout performances also include Jin
Park 'l6 as Alfred Doolittle, who delivered
several show-stopping comedic music num
bers with vocal and physical ease; Weston

Gaylord 'l5 as Colonel Pickering, whose
comedic timing oils the wheels of every
scene he enters; and Andrew Forsyth 'l4 as
Freddy Eynesford-Hill, whose voice is angelic
enough during "On The Street Where You
Live" it could have warranted had two or
three more reprises.

This show is clearly the product of much
time, funding, effort, thought and creative in
spiration. It has nearly all the gloss and gleam
of a professional production and meets a
unique and valuable goal: to endow a well
known musical with the power to think crit
ically about racial identity. A job well done.

part, because the plot, with the addition of a racial
lens, creates intriguing ideological tensions with
every song and scene. When, in the first scene of the


Courtsey of Ken Savage
show, Higgins sang "An Englishman's way of
speaking absolutely classifies him," we could
already hear the lyrics echo with deep cultural
implications based on the world Savage cre
ates. Later, when Higgins bet he could turn
Eliza Doolittle into a "lady," we wondered
what the definition of a lady is, in terms of
cultural expectations for an Asian Eliza. The
audience may have even been nudged to
wards reconsidering the significance and per
haps hidden meaning of the word "fair" in
"My Fair Lady," as it pertains to Asian cultural
norms and Western assimilation.
Yet, perhaps most importantly, Savage
and his creative team refuse to allow for a
strict binary between Western identity and
Eastern identity, high-class and low-class, rich

and poor. Every character in this play seemed
to exist on some sort of cultural identity
spectrum, including the members of the en
semble. There was room for hybridity in
racial identity. Some street vendors wear
Westernized clothing but speak in a Cockney
accent, while some maids in the Higgins
household maintain an elite British dialect
but dress in traditionally Eastern attire
the combinations are seemingly endless.
Also vital to this process is the excellent
costume and set design, done by the talented
Asia Chao 'l5. Higgins' home is decorated in
swatches of red and yellow seemingly orien
tal patterns, and a recognizable icon of East
meets-West vase of blue and white Chi
nese porcelain —is seen in almost every

scene of the show. And speaking of blue and
white, the costumes featured in "Ascot
Gavotte" (my favorite scene in the show) are
positively lavish English-style gowns, hats,
suits, canes, parasols and the like. Yet, these
Western modes of dress are done entirely in
blue and white as an explicit nod to Chinese
porcelain (as well as a brilliant play on the
original black and white from the 1964 film).
The ensemble shows their abilities vocally
and physically during this scene, nailing the
stylized crispness and haughty atmosphere of
a day at the races in British high society.
Standout performances also include Jin
Park 'l6 as Alfred Doolittle, who delivered
several show-stopping comedic music num
bers with vocal and physical ease; Weston

Gaylord 'l5 as Colonel Pickering, whose
comedic timing oils the wheels of every
scene he enters; and Andrew Forsyth 'l4 as
Freddy Eynesford-Hill, whose voice is angelic
enough during "On The Street Where You
Live" it could have warranted had two or
three more reprises.

This show is clearly the product of much
time, funding, effort, thought and creative in
spiration. It has nearly all the gloss and gleam
of a professional production and meets a
unique and valuable goal: to endow a well
known musical with the power to think crit
ically about racial identity. A job well done.

Say the words "My Fair Lady," and one is more
likely to recall images of Audrey Hepburn than ques
tions of race.

The Stanford Asian American Theater Project's
recent production of "My Fair Lady" boldly re-envi
sions the musical, however, by creating an Asian-in
spired version of the show, infusing the musical with
the politics of racial identity. As Ken Savage ' 14's sen
ior project for the Theater and Performance Studies
major, the show deftly transforms the story of "My
Fair Lady" from a quaint tale of maneuvering vowel
sounds to a compelling story of Asian identity forma
tion in the Western world by exploring the cultural
expectations surrounding speech, dress and behavior
and questions of assimilation.
The show, which sold out twice as the first stu
dent production to be shown in Bing Concert Hall,
follows an Asian Henry Higgins and an Asian Eliza
Doolittle in early 20th century London. The charac
ter of Henry Higgins represents the upper-class Eng
lish elite in the traditional version of "My Fair Lady,"
yet in this Asian-inspired production, Henry Higgins

(played by the capable Max Savage 'l6 Ken's
younger brother) is a more complex being. Savage
embodies an Asian man with an elite, wealthy and
Westernized Asian identity, signaled by his beautiful
English dress and high society English dialect, and ful
ly plays out his character as an unapologetically nar
row-minded academic whose quirks we both despise
and love.

Eliza Doolittle (played by Saya Jenks 'l6), repre
sents the opposite end of the identity spectrum in
this show she has a rough Cockney accent and
dirtied clothes to represent a non-elite identity,
which, in contrast to Higgins, held implications of a
poor, non-assimilated, Asian identity. Jenks gave the
audience an intensely animated version of Doolittle,
all groans and squeals, and seemed to be operating in
full gear from start to finish.
