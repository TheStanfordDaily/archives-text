Say the words "My Fair Lady," and one is more
likely to recall images of Audrey Hepburn than ques
tions of race.

The Stanford Asian American Theater Project's
recent production of "My Fair Lady" boldly re-envi
sions the musical, however, by creating an Asian-in
spired version of the show, infusing the musical with
the politics of racial identity. As Ken Savage ' 14's sen
ior project for the Theater and Performance Studies
major, the show deftly transforms the story of "My
Fair Lady" from a quaint tale of maneuvering vowel
sounds to a compelling story of Asian identity forma
tion in the Western world by exploring the cultural
expectations surrounding speech, dress and behavior
and questions of assimilation.
The show, which sold out twice as the first stu
dent production to be shown in Bing Concert Hall,
follows an Asian Henry Higgins and an Asian Eliza
Doolittle in early 20th century London. The charac
ter of Henry Higgins represents the upper-class Eng
lish elite in the traditional version of "My Fair Lady,"
yet in this Asian-inspired production, Henry Higgins

(played by the capable Max Savage 'l6 Ken's
younger brother) is a more complex being. Savage
embodies an Asian man with an elite, wealthy and
Westernized Asian identity, signaled by his beautiful
English dress and high society English dialect, and ful
ly plays out his character as an unapologetically nar
row-minded academic whose quirks we both despise
and love.

Eliza Doolittle (played by Saya Jenks 'l6), repre
sents the opposite end of the identity spectrum in
this show she has a rough Cockney accent and
dirtied clothes to represent a non-elite identity,
which, in contrast to Higgins, held implications of a
poor, non-assimilated, Asian identity. Jenks gave the
audience an intensely animated version of Doolittle,
all groans and squeals, and seemed to be operating in
full gear from start to finish.
As the show unfolds, however, it stays true to
the original script. This was a wise choice on Savage's
part, because the plot, with the addition of a racial
lens, creates intriguing ideological tensions with
every song and scene. When, in the first scene of the
