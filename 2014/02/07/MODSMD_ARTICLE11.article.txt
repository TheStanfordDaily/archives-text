## 'HOUSE OF LIES' FINDS PROMISING IDENTITY 
### CLARISSE PERALTA DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
"House of Lies" is Matthew
Carnahan's latest comedy on Show
time, based on the book House of
Lies: How Management Consult
ants Steal Your Watch and Then
Tell You the Time by Martin Kihn.
Currently in its third season, the
show stars Don Cheadle as Marty
Kaan, a big-time management con
sultant. Kaan and his team, played by
Kirsten Bell, Josh Lawson and Ben
Schwartz, solve a company's latest
problem every week, brashly offer
ing their two cents on how their
clients can make even more money
by using just about every trick to get
the information clients want.

In each 30-minute episode,
Kaan and his associates make a
mockery out of the industry, from
bizarre board meetings to extrava
gant social lifestyles. Admittedly, I
first watched the show out of cu
riosity and an affinity for Bell. I
could care less for the other charac

ters, who all seemed to be egotistic
and incredibly obnoxious. However,
the storyline began to evolve as the
show progressed, and I found my
self hooked. I wanted to understand
why Marty and his wife got a di
vorce and how this affected his in
ability to commit. I soon realized
why Jeannie kept her personal life a
secret from her co-workers and wit
nessed the nerdy Doug settle down
with his equally nerdy girlfriend,
Sarah. It was these back-stories that
helped balance the show's innate
absurdity.
Bell plays the role of Jeannie ef
fortlessly. As the only female lead,
she is a revelation, no longer rele
gated to being the associate that
jokes around with the boys. Her
complicated relationship with Kaan
keeps the viewer guessing because
she is unwilling to act on her feel
ings. Her unwavering commitment
to her job is somewhat admirable,
but it leads her to act impulsively if
it means closing a deal. It's during
these scenes that Bell is most effec

tive, because Jeannie can get into
rather compromising situations that
are almost unbelievable. She can be
extremely calculating and manipula
tive but also outspoken and empow
ering— a far cry from the usual
femme fatale.
As Kaan, Cheadle is both de
plorable and charming; despite his
questionable antics, he merits the
viewer's sympathy. I personally love
watching him interact with his bi
sexual teenage son, Roscoe, as well

as his own father. In fact, Cheadle's
convincing performance earned
him last year's Golden Globe for
Best Performance by an Actor in a
Television Series.

Although "House of lies" may
offer an exaggerated version of the
consulting industry, it is surprising
ly entertaining and serves as some
what of a preview of what the job of
a consultant really entails. After two
seasons, I definitely think that the
show has finally found its identity,

and can only get better from here
on. With the characters no longer
working for the same firm and Kaan
establishing his own, it will be inter
esting to see how the series will un
fold. So whether you find yourself
preparing for your next case inter
view, or miraculously have time on
your hands, I would highly recom
mend watching an episode or two.
