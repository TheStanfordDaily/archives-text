# REVIEW: Life on Earth's most densely populated island
## 
### SKYLAR COHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With our campus's wide
open spaces and endless con
nectivity, one might be forgiven
for struggling to relate to a
world of claustrophobia and iso
lation. Yet student Luke
Lorentzen ' 15's moving docu
mentary Santa Cruz del Islote
(in Spanish, with subtitles) does
a fantastic job of making rent
able the most densely populated
island on Earth, which is three
acres and part of Colombia.

As Stanford does not fund
projects in countries on the
State Department's Travel Warn
ing list, Lorentzen obtained the
film's funding through Kick
starter, promising an explo
ration of overpopulation. The
film follows the stories of two is
landers — Juancho Julio
Vasquez, a gently frustrated fish
erman, and Juan Pablo, a gifted
child with a love of learning

as both struggle with the literal
and metaphorical distance be
tween their little town and the
mainland.

An idyllic sense of peace
pervades much of the film, but
this is clearly an oasis in danger.
Alongside scenes of children
happily canoeing, we see that
the island's humble motorboats
are unable to compete against
more elaborate fishing boats. In
a Q&A session after the film,
Lorentzen said that the over
whelming sense of solitude he

found while he was there played
a large role in the final cut of the
film. Juancho spends much of
his time floating in the ocean
alone with his fishing partner,
and Juan must reconcile his in
tellectual vitality with his minis
cule schoolroom and few class
mates.

The documentary is only
20 minutes long, and every sec
ond of footage is meticulously
chosen for maximum effect.
The film comprehensively ex
plores its central ideas while
subtly posing additional ques
tions about the island's future.
From several beautiful shots of
the island alone in the ocean to
a spectacular underwater se
quence, to a final candle in the
dark, the audiovisual experience
between the cinematogra
phy and the simple yet effective
score —is a transcendent yet
haunting one.
Lorentzen's film explores a
very foreign way of life in order
to raise questions about our
own. This dream-like film is far
from our lives, but similar
enough in the islanders' emo
tions and struggles not to be ex
otic at all. Perhaps there is a
middle ground between our
technological complexity and
the island's love and simplicity,
though the current imbalance
between the two poses a dire
threat to the latter's existence.
