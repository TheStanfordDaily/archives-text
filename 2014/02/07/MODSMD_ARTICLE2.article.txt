## Style at Stanford Fashion programs lag behind those of peer institutions 
### JOSIE HODSON DESK EDITOR 
On first glance, Stanford may seem vaguely apa
thetic towards fashion. A quick look around the quad
certainly reveals the Stanford student uniform a free
t-shirt from the most recent career fair and a pair of
sweatpants likely bought at the campus bookstore. Even
so, a growing number of students are interested in the
fashion industry—and pushing to change campus ac
cordingly.

"Fashion is certainly not a big thing at Stanford, but
I feel like it's up and coming now," said Ellen Rudolph
'l6. "There are more opportunities to learn about fash
ion and there is a lot more interest than there has been
in the past."

So far, this academic year has seen the creation of
two campus fashion magazine startups, including one
(MINT Magazine) that plans to produce a fashion show
in spring; the conclusion of the Stanford Arts Institute's
Fashion at Stanford series; and the hosting of several
speakers from the fashion industry by Stanford Women
in Business.

Even so, Stanford still lags behind peer institutions
in terms of university-sponsored programs for students
interested in entering the fashion industry.

Institutional engagement elsewhere
At Harvard, the school's oldest fashion show "Elegan
za" one of several on campus is approaching its 20th
year. Vivian Lee, a Harvard student and one of two execu
tive producers of Eleganza, said that Harvard's career serv
ices have been doing a better job of bringing more fashion
companies onto campus and helping students figure out
their options in the industry.

"They've been trying to develop these relation
ships rather than make us develop them on our own,"
Lee said.
Harvard also offers a program
called the Vestis Council, which
"seeks to provide educational, phil
anthropic and post-academic oppor
tunities for its members, while ex
ploring fashion as a trade, as a tradi
tion and as an outlet for creative ex
pression."
The University of Pennsylvania
(UPenn) similarly has a number of
opportunities for students interested
in fashion. The University's Wharton
School runs The Wharton Retail
Club, which forges "a strong rela
tionship between students interest
ed in retail and the retail industry,"
according to its website. The organi
zation facilitates career panels for
both undergraduates and graduate
students and aims to create a strong
alumni network.

Another UPenn student group,
Dzine2Show, aims to provide stu
dents with the opportunity to learn
about the makings of the fashion in
dustry. Dzine2Show is part of the
Penn Fashion Collective, which also
produces a style and fashion maga
zine twice yearly.
According to Rolanda Evelyn, a
student at UPenn and a member of
the Penn Fashion Collective, there
are frequent retail events "every
other week" and the program
brings in many speakers from the in
dustry to lecture to members.
"Its great to be around people
who are interested in the same
things," she said.
"Though there isn't a fashion
design major, I personally feel that
the Collective provides student de
signers with a great outlet to make
and show their work," Alexis
Richards, another student involved
with the Collective, wrote in an
email to The Daily.

Penn does offer a Consumer
Psychology minor and a retailing con
centration.

Yale and Cornell also offer mul
tiple opportunities for students in
terested in fashion. Yale has two un
dergraduate fashion clubs YCou

ture and Runway Inc. and Cor
nell has a fashion collective that has
put on fashion shows for 30 years.
Cornell also offers a Fiber Science
and Apparel Design undergraduate
major.

Burgeoning student initiatives
By contrast, Stanford's only rec
ognized fashion related club, aside
from the newly founded MINT
magazine, is at the Graduate
School of Business: the Retail &
Luxury Goods Club. Out of roughly
280 business graduate students,
the retail club has 70 to 80 active
members and a much longer inter
est list. Unfortunately, entry into the
Stanford Retail Club is exclusive to
business graduate students.
Alex Day MBA 'l4, co-presi
dent of the Retail Club, stated that
she would be willing to begin a men
torship program if the demand for
one arose.

"If there's any sense that people
in undergrad want mentorship from
people who have been in the indus
try ...we'd be open to forming
those relationships," she said. "To
tell you the truth the business
school gets a little insular —we live
in our campus and don't move
much beyond it... we'd always be
happy to be a resource."
There are, however, other ways
for undergraduates interested in
fashion to get involved on campus.
Last winter, for example,
Rudolph applied and was accepted
to be part of Rent the Runway's "It-
Girl Program." She, along with sev
eral girls on college campuses
around the country, was made re
sponsible for her own Rent the Run
way closet on campus. For $75 a
month, students could subscribe to
her closet and have full access to the
25 or so dresses. Rudolph had 20
subscribers last year and now serves
as a campus representative for the
company.

Emmy Armintrout 'l4 took a
more typically Stanford approach to
fashion, stumbling into the industry
through an internship last summer
at a startup. When Armintrout ap
plied to Third Love, an app that uses
photos and computer vision to take
women's measurements and create

custom-sized bras, the company was
in stealth, meaning that she didn't
even fully know what they did until
she started working there.
Following the internship, Am
introut became an ambassador for
Third Love at Stanford. As an ambas
sador, Armintrout is responsible for
promoting the brand on campus
through events and her Facebook
page, and she has also given students
an opportunity to connect with
Third Love cofounder Heidi Zak.
"The fashion world is increas
ingly intersecting with tech, which I
think is exciting for Stanford stu
dents who have interests in both,"
Armintrout said.
Fashion has also entered into ac
ademia at Stanford, with a growing
number of classes now focusing on
the field.
"1 think Stanford has made
great strides in making it a legiti
mate academic field," Rudolph
said. "There are more art history
classes that explore fashion and
speaker series that feature people
in the industry."
Elizabeth Kessler, a lecturer in
art and art history, teaches one such
class, called Fashion Shows: From
Lady Godiva to Lady Gaga. Kessler's
class focuses on the nexus between
fashion and art. The class had an en
rollment of 55 students last year.

"I can say that there is a lot of
interest for students now in fash
ion," Kessler said.
Kessler focused specifically on
the scholarship of fashion, which she
thinks is a growing field.
"In general I think college is
about thinking about big questions
... Fashion is a really big part of our
visual culture and our visual experi
ence, [and] there are big questions
about what that says and why that
is," Kessler said. "If that leads to and
fuels professional interests for stu
dents then that meeting is all to the
good."

Despite the recent spike in at
tention paid to fashion on campus,
some students said that they still
hope for more on-campus opportuni
ties, similar to those offered at other
universities.

"I didn't come to Stanford to
study fashion, but it's an interest of
mine and a potential career path,"
Rudolph said. "I feel like I've had to
go off the beaten path to pursue op
portunities because there aren't
many fashion opportunities here. It's
definitely been frustrating but it's al
so allowed me to pave the way for
myself and others who share the
same interest."

in the past."

So far, this academic year has seen the creation of
two campus fashion magazine startups, including one
(MINT Magazine) that plans to produce a fashion show
in spring; the conclusion of the Stanford Arts Institute's
Fashion at Stanford series; and the hosting of several
speakers from the fashion industry by Stanford Women
in Business.

Even so, Stanford still lags behind peer institutions
in terms of university-sponsored programs for students
interested in entering the fashion industry.

Institutional engagement elsewhere
At Harvard, the school's oldest fashion show "Elegan
za" one of several on campus is approaching its 20th
year. Vivian Lee, a Harvard student and one of two execu
tive producers of Eleganza, said that Harvard's career serv
ices have been doing a better job of bringing more fashion
companies onto campus and helping students figure out
their options in the industry.

"They've been trying to develop these relation
ships rather than make us develop them on our own,"
Lee said.
Harvard also offers a program
called the Vestis Council, which
"seeks to provide educational, phil
anthropic and post-academic oppor
tunities for its members, while ex
ploring fashion as a trade, as a tradi
tion and as an outlet for creative ex
pression."
The University of Pennsylvania
(UPenn) similarly has a number of
opportunities for students interested
in fashion. The University's Wharton
School runs The Wharton Retail
Club, which forges "a strong rela
tionship between students interest
ed in retail and the retail industry,"
according to its website. The organi
zation facilitates career panels for
both undergraduates and graduate
students and aims to create a strong
alumni network.

Another UPenn student group,
Dzine2Show, aims to provide stu
dents with the opportunity to learn
about the makings of the fashion in
dustry. Dzine2Show is part of the
Penn Fashion Collective, which also
produces a style and fashion maga
zine twice yearly.
According to Rolanda Evelyn, a
student at UPenn and a member of
the Penn Fashion Collective, there
are frequent retail events "every
other week" and the program
brings in many speakers from the in
dustry to lecture to members.
"Its great to be around people
who are interested in the same
things," she said.
"Though there isn't a fashion
design major, I personally feel that
the Collective provides student de
signers with a great outlet to make
and show their work," Alexis
Richards, another student involved
with the Collective, wrote in an
email to The Daily.

Penn does offer a Consumer
Psychology minor and a retailing con
centration.

Yale and Cornell also offer mul
tiple opportunities for students in
terested in fashion. Yale has two un
dergraduate fashion clubs YCou

ture and Runway Inc. and Cor
nell has a fashion collective that has
put on fashion shows for 30 years.
Cornell also offers a Fiber Science
and Apparel Design undergraduate
major.

Burgeoning student initiatives
By contrast, Stanford's only rec
ognized fashion related club, aside
from the newly founded MINT
magazine, is at the Graduate
School of Business: the Retail &
Luxury Goods Club. Out of roughly
280 business graduate students,
the retail club has 70 to 80 active
members and a much longer inter
est list. Unfortunately, entry into the
Stanford Retail Club is exclusive to
business graduate students.
Alex Day MBA 'l4, co-presi
dent of the Retail Club, stated that
she would be willing to begin a men
torship program if the demand for
one arose.

"If there's any sense that people
in undergrad want mentorship from
people who have been in the indus
try ...we'd be open to forming
those relationships," she said. "To
tell you the truth the business
school gets a little insular —we live
in our campus and don't move
much beyond it... we'd always be
happy to be a resource."
There are, however, other ways
for undergraduates interested in
fashion to get involved on campus.
Last winter, for example,
Rudolph applied and was accepted
to be part of Rent the Runway's "It-
Girl Program." She, along with sev
eral girls on college campuses
around the country, was made re
sponsible for her own Rent the Run
way closet on campus. For $75 a
month, students could subscribe to
her closet and have full access to the
25 or so dresses. Rudolph had 20
subscribers last year and now serves
as a campus representative for the
company.

Emmy Armintrout 'l4 took a
more typically Stanford approach to
fashion, stumbling into the industry
through an internship last summer
at a startup. When Armintrout ap
plied to Third Love, an app that uses
photos and computer vision to take
women's measurements and create

custom-sized bras, the company was
in stealth, meaning that she didn't
even fully know what they did until
she started working there.
Following the internship, Am
introut became an ambassador for
Third Love at Stanford. As an ambas
sador, Armintrout is responsible for
promoting the brand on campus
through events and her Facebook
page, and she has also given students
an opportunity to connect with
Third Love cofounder Heidi Zak.
"The fashion world is increas
ingly intersecting with tech, which I
think is exciting for Stanford stu
dents who have interests in both,"
Armintrout said.
Fashion has also entered into ac
ademia at Stanford, with a growing
number of classes now focusing on
the field.
"1 think Stanford has made
great strides in making it a legiti
mate academic field," Rudolph
said. "There are more art history
classes that explore fashion and
speaker series that feature people
in the industry."
Elizabeth Kessler, a lecturer in
art and art history, teaches one such
class, called Fashion Shows: From
Lady Godiva to Lady Gaga. Kessler's
class focuses on the nexus between
fashion and art. The class had an en
rollment of 55 students last year.

"I can say that there is a lot of
interest for students now in fash
ion," Kessler said.
Kessler focused specifically on
the scholarship of fashion, which she
thinks is a growing field.
"In general I think college is
about thinking about big questions
... Fashion is a really big part of our
visual culture and our visual experi
ence, [and] there are big questions
about what that says and why that
is," Kessler said. "If that leads to and
fuels professional interests for stu
dents then that meeting is all to the
good."

Despite the recent spike in at
tention paid to fashion on campus,
some students said that they still
hope for more on-campus opportuni
ties, similar to those offered at other
universities.

"I didn't come to Stanford to
study fashion, but it's an interest of
mine and a potential career path,"
Rudolph said. "I feel like I've had to
go off the beaten path to pursue op
portunities because there aren't
many fashion opportunities here. It's
definitely been frustrating but it's al
so allowed me to pave the way for
myself and others who share the
same interest."

On first glance, Stanford may seem vaguely apa

certainly reveals the Stanford student uniform a free
t-shirt from the most recent career fair and a pair of
sweatpants likely bought at the campus bookstore. Even
so, a growing number of students are interested in the
