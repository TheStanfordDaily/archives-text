# ROBINSON'S SHOT, 10 YEARS LATER
## 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Annie Robinson turns 10 next
month, but her dad will be on a busi
ness trip that night. The Southern
Utah men's basketball team will be
in Missoula, Mont., and Pops has a
game to coach.
If you follow Stanford basket
ball, you probably don't know much
about the Thunderbirds. Yet you
have heard of Annie, maybe by a dif
ferent name, the one that broadcast
ers Brent Musburger and Dick Vi
tale proposed on national television
10 years ago today.
"Buzzer-beater."

Some call it "The Miracle at
Maples"; others, simply "The Shot."
But when Nick Robinson 'O4 M.A.
'O5 sunk a 35-foot runner as time
expired to give No. 2 Stanford an
80-77 win against No. 12 Arizona
sending Musburger and Vitale
into hysterics, the Sixth Man Club
onto the Maples Pavilion hardwood
and the Cardinal to a 20-0 record
there were, in truth, no words to de
scribe what had just happened.
Ten years after Robinson's icon
ic shot, that has changed.
"As a huge Stanford fan in pret
ty much any sport, this was one of
the greatest games I've ever been
to," Tiger Woods told The Daily
through his agent last month. "To
come back like that, and with that
type of shot, is something I'll never
forget."

"It's one of the best finishes
I've ever seen," added Heisman Tro
phy winner and Super Bowl MVP
Jim Plunkett '7l, who sat behind
Woods at the game. "It goes down
with the great Stanford historic mo
ments."

The moment itself has lingered
in the memories of Cardinal fans for
a decade, and it has stuck with

members of the 2003-04 hoops
team as well. Rob Little 'O5, then
Stanford's starting center, has a
framed photo in his house of Robin
son shooting the ball; Josh Childress
'O5, the team's star forward and a
seven-year NBA veteran, still gets
chills watching that clip.
But the story of Feb. 7,2004, is
not just one of an improbable steal
and an impossible shot. It's one of a
fierce West Coast rivalry, hitting its
unforgettable zenith; of a basketball
frenzied campus, converging on its
beloved stomping grounds for one
final season; of a 24-year-old utility
player, at once the odd man out and
his team's most respected member;
and of a group of 14 conference

champion teammates, the likes of
which haven't been seen on the
Farm since.
♦ ♦♦
They were a team in the fullest
sense of the word, the phoenix that
rose out of the ashes of four NBA
departures—Jason and Jarron
Collins, Casey Jacobsen and Curtis
Borchardt in two years. That old
guard had set a new standard for
Cardinal men's basketball under
head coach Mike Montgomery,
starting the 2000-01 season 20-0,
holding the No. 1 spot for much of
that year and reaching the Elite
Eight.

Facing a significant experience
gap entering the 2002-03 season,

Stanford was picked to finish sev
enth in the Pac-10. But instead of
going their separate ways for the
summer, as most college players
did at the time, the entire Cardinal
roster stayed on campus to train.
They had seen an earlier generation
of teammates make Stanford an
elite college basketball program,
and they wanted to do the same.
The team finished second, and the
next summer, it followed the same
routine to prepare for the 2003-04
season.

"We felt that we had the talent
to [return to the top]," says the
team's junior point guard, Chris
Hernandez 'O5 M.A. 'O6. "We held
each other accountable, people

calling people up if they didn't
show up for a voluntary workout
and whatnot."

"Everyone was the one guy
trying to play the hardest in prac
tice every day," adds Joe Kirchofer
'O3, one of the team's three cap
tains. "It wasn't just one of us; it
was everybody trying to set that
tone, which made it really fun."
Most important was a lack of
ego from Stanford's top players, in
cluding from the most talented of
them all, Childress.
"Our best players wanted the
team to be successful more than
they wanted themselves to be sue-

cessful," Kirchofer says. "I think Josh Chil
dress deserves a ton of credit for the way
that we all approached the team and the way
that we were able to work together so effec
tively."

Though Childress was just months away
from being selected sixth overall in the NBA
draft higher than any other player in Stan
ford history the talented forward brought
a calm focus to Cardinal practices.
The vocal leadership was left to Kir
chofer and guard Matt Lottich 'O4, a deadly
3-point shooter and the team's second-lead
ing scorer. He was the team's most competi
tive player, and unlike Childress, he let it
show.

"The guy was in your face, talking smack
in your practice, kind of getting people
rough," Hernandez remembers. "Sometimes
you're going through practices and you're
working hard, but your mind might not be re
ally there. You're thinking about the 20-page
paper you have to write later that night or all
the different stuff that goes on at school. And
sometimes you get someone who can sense
that. They get in your face, they get you fo
cused, get you mad so that you want to really
compete and beat that person.
"But you can't have five people who are
like that," he adds, "because you would nev
er get anything done. Everyone would just be
yelling at each other all the time."
The Childress-Lottich foil exemplified
the team's diverse personalities. There was
the philosophical Little, a 6-foot-10 center
whose opinions were as thoughtful as his
name was ironic; Justin Davis, a comedic big
man who could lighten the mood in an in
stant; and Kirchofer, a fifth-year leader whose
positive attitude and work ethic had made
him a primary backup over a long career. Set
ting the tone on the court was Hernandez,
who returned after breaking his foot twice
and missing the entire 2002-03 season, in
stantly making the Cardinal better with his
mistake-free play and ability to read the
game.

Nick Robinson wasn't an injury-hard
ened vet, a future NBA talent or even a trash
talker, but in this cast of characters, it was he
who stood out. Robinson had originally
signed with Stanford in 1997, but he took
two years off for a Mormon mission in Brazil,
where he kept in practice by playing against
his fellow missionaries on an outdoor court.
When Robinson finally made it to the Farm,
he was as old as the team's juniors.
"I had never met Nick, but I was really
excited because we were two freshmen com

ing into the team," Lottich remembers. "And
all of a sudden, he's on campus saying things
like, 'Yeah, I got married last week.' Our lives
were very different, very quickly."
Instead of living in the dorms, Robinson
and his wife Meagan moved into the on-cam
pus couples housing in Escondido Village. By
the start of the 2003-04 season, Nick was
the oldest player on the team even though he
was just a junior athletically.
"He could've been living on the moon,
his lifestyle was so different than ours," Kir
chofer says. "But his wife was pregnant and
we were super-excited, like the whole team
was getting a little brother or something.
"A little sister, as it were."
Annie was due on March 1, 2004.
Robinson's teammates started calling him
'Pops.'
Despite his family responsibilities,
Robinson was no outcast. His perspective
may have been different, but Lottich remem
bers that it kept the team even-keeled, and
Childress says that Robinson's opinions were
always valued highly. The team even saw
Meagan's home-cooked meals as a chance to
get away from the college lifestyle.
"I've played a lot of basketball since then
and I've coached basketball, and I haven't re
ally been a part of a locker room that was that
tight," Lottich says. "I haven't been part of a
group of guys that I trust more, both on and
off the court, than that group ... There's no
doubt in my mind that if one of them calls
me right now and needs something, I'd be on
the next plane out. It was that special."
On the court, Robinson was the final, in
valuable piece in the Cardinal puzzle. He was
usually listed as a forward, but he played all
over the floor, guarding different positions,
creating steals and contributing a few buck
ets a game in Robinson's own words, do
ing whatever he could to help.
And the Cardinal needed all the help it
could get early in the season, with Childress
out for over a month with a stress reaction in
his foot. But Stanford rolled through noncon
ference play, knocking off then-No. 1 Kansas
in a win that shocked everyone but the Car
dinal. The team amassed a 9-0 record and
rose to No. 5 in the country before Chil
dress' return for the Pac-10 opener.

"We felt like that with him and with
everybody at full strength, we would be
poised for a really special season," Robinson
says.

Slowly but surely, Childress made his
way back onto the court: seven minutes
against Washington State, 13 against Wash

ington, 26 at Arizona State. 9-0 became 10'
0, and 11-0 became 12-0.

Childress' first start of the season came
in the Cardinal's sixth conference game, a
67-52 thrashing of UCLA. 15-0. Suddenly,
Stanford was one of just two undefeated
teams in the country. 16-0. 17-0. Questions
about the streak started flowing in.
"On a team like this it's impossible to
have things not occur to you, because all the
sportswriters need something to write
about," Kirchofer says. "We knew we had a
chance to do something really special, but
there was never any thought that we had
done something special. It was all a work in
progress."
Second-ranked Stanford rolled into Eu
gene, Ore., on Jan. 31 without the services
of Davis, who had hurt his knee in win num
ber 17, and for the first time all year, the Car
dinal wasn't able to pick up the slack. A mid
dling Oregon team jumped out to a 45-26
lead. Nothing was working; Childress was
having an off night, Robinson was l-of-8 from
the field and Little played just five minutes
due to foul trouble.
Stanford called timeout.

"Nobody was in there talking about,
'Oh, what if we're not undefeated tomor
row,'" Kirchofer remembers. "It was more
just about getting it done."
"I remember our assistant coach, Russell

Turner, just got in my face and started ripping
me a new one," Hernandez says. "Obviously
I'm paraphrasing, but, 'When are you going
to play? You going to start playing?'"
That's when the Cardinal's point guard,
its self-proclaimed distributor, flipped the
switch. Hernandez became aggressive, driv
ing time and time again, making trip after trip
to the free-throw line. All 22 of his points
came after halftime, and with the help of 19
points from Davis' replacement, sophomore
Matt Haryasz, the Cardinal escaped 83-80.
Halfway through the conference season,
Stanford was still undefeated. The phoenix
had taken flight.

Lute Olson steps off the bus at the top
of the loading dock behind Maples, and the
boos commence. He turns to their source, a
group of about two-dozen Stanford students
gathered on an overlooking pathway. Olson
tries to say something, but he can't be heard
over the crowd. Finally, he gets through.
"You should be at ASU," he tells them.
"You've got that kind of class."
It's Saturday morning, and the Sixth
Man Club has been waiting all week for the
venerated Arizona coach's arrival. The first
ones arrived at Maples on Tuesday, pitching
their tents on the chilly concrete. The early

few slept there for four nights through the
cold and the rain, not for tickets they
had those but for front-row seats.

There was a brief respite on Thursday
night for Stanford's 81-51 win against Ari
zona State. Afterward, the crowd only
grew. A couch was hauled over; many of
them had done this before. By Friday night,
Maples was hosting its own party, complete
with booze, dancing and a karaoke machine.
Well past midnight it continued, until the
students decided to get some shut-eye be
fore Saturday's noon tip.
The team has developed its own coun
terpart to the Sixth Man's tradition. Around
9 a.m., not long before the arrival of the
Wildcats' team bus, a few Cardinal players
stopped by to deliver donuts to the stu
dents.

"I can honestly say there were games
that [the students] did make me play hard,"
Childress says 10 years later. "It's a differ
ent level of adrenaline that you get from
your home crowd cheering you on."
"They were at every game, and they
packed that sideline," Robinson remembers.
2003-04 is Lottich's senior season, and
over the last four years, he has grown to be
lieve that the Cardinal has the best home
court advantage in college basketball. But
while it helps to have students camping out
for several games a year, at least some of the
credit has to go to the court itself.
At a school as unique as Stanford, per
haps it's fitting that the Maples of 2004 has
its own quirk: the floor. If you look closely
at the court, you can't see anything special;
it's just any other hardwood floor, just sit
ting there.
Until you feel it move.
Built on four layers of crisscrossing
beams, the one-of-a-kind surface is meant to
be springier than any other in college athlet
ics. The thinking was that an extra little bit
of give would reduce players' injuries while
also allowing them to jump higher.
And oh, do the students jump.
Their old wooden bleachers, really, are
one with the court, and the Sixth Man Club
likes to make its presence felt. Literally.
"I can remember coming in as a high
school guy, watching a game, Arizona-Stan
ford," Hernandez now says. "This Arizona
power forward was at the line shooting, and
the Sixth Man was just rocking the benches
over on the side. It was so loud, and they
were jumping so hard, that the floor was
moving, and it was making the basket move.
And Lute Olson is on the side just scream

ing at the refs to stop the game and make
the students stop so the player could shoot
the free throw without the bucket moving."
The most publicized incident of Olson
stopping a game at Maples due to a shaky
basket during free throws came in 1988,
when the Cardinal upset the No. 1 Wild
cats. Hernandez would have been just 4
years old, so chances are, the basket-shaking
happened more than once.
"When I was in high school, when I'd
come up for unofficial visits, I'd come for the
Arizona-Stanford game," Hernandez adds. "It
was just a different type of energy."
Though the students camping out for

today's game weren't around for the rival
ry's inception by most accounts, it was
sparked by that 1988 upset they have
watched it intensify with Stanford's new
levels of success in recent years. The rival
ry's vitriol was renewed in 1996, after the
Cardinal upset No. 9 Arizona to snap a 15-
game losing streak to the Wildcats. Two
years later, Arizona secured an outright Pac
-10 title by embarrassing the second-place
Cardinal 90-58 at the McKale Center, but
the next season at Maples, Stanford
clinched its first conference championship


DAVID GONZALES/Stanford Athletics
Some students camped out in front of Maples Pavilion for four days leading up to the Saturday
Arizona game, with the gathering hitting its climax with an impromptu party on Friday
night. The team dropped by at 9 a.m. on Saturday morning with donuts for its loyal fans.
in 36 years with an emotional win
against those very same Wildcats.
Kirchofer stepped onto the
Farm the very next year. In his
first nine games against Arizona,
he has seen the teams go 5-4, with
an average margin of victory of
just five points. But though they
have won the Pac-10 three of
those four years, the conference's
two superpowers are not alike.
"Stanford basketball, for most
of Coach Montgomery's tenure,
was a tough, hard-nosed pro
gram," Kirchofer says. "And Ari
zona, at the time, was 'the oppo
site' is a little bit harsh but they
were a team that was really explo
sive and fun to watch, but really, re
ally unpredictable and all over the
place. And they were good and had
lots of good players, and we knew
they could be really good. But we al
so, I think, wanted to show that our
approach was superior, and wanted
to make a statement that they had
some good players, but they really
couldn't hang with us as a team."

The Cardinal made that state
ment early in the season, when it
handled the No. 3 Wildcats 82-72
on Arizona's home court. (Stanford
led by 20 with four minutes left.) It
was the team's fourth straight win at

McKale, and it spurred a telling joke
on the trip home.

"We said, 'Well, we can't wait

to go home and look at the high
lights from our game,' because
they're going to all be Arizona's,"
Lottich says. "They were a flashier
team, they were more athletic, they
jumped higher, they got in all the
Sports Center highlights. But at the
end of the day, we got some Ws."

The 2003-04 Arizona team is
particularly skilled; its starting five of
Andre Igoudala, Channing Frye,
Mustafa Shakur, Salim Stoudamire
and Hassan Adams will all go on to
play in the NBA. And as successful
as the Cardinal had been at McKale,
this generation of Wildcats has been
unfazed by the hostile environment
at Maples, earning four straight vic
tories on the Farm. If No. 2 Stanford
wants to extend its perfect season,
it has to take back its home court.

"The part that I remember
most about the series is that more
often than not, the away team won
the game," little says. "We were
just really amped up to win at
home."

The Sixth Man, too, has been
waiting for this game, which is why
they're overlooking the loading dock
in the early hours of this fateful Sat

urday morning.
The first Arizona players step
off the bus now, and the boos rain
down once again. One of the stu
dents shouts something about
Stoudamire's cousin Damon, an Ari
zona alum and current NBA player
who was recently arrested for mari
juana possession.

It's the morning of Feb. 7,
2004. Beats By Dre won't be found
ed for four more years, but several
Arizona players have their head
phones glued on as they walk past
the crowd's persistent shouts.
One by one, the Wildcats de
scend the ramp and enter Maples
Pavilion. The students go back to
their tents. For now, it's quiet.

Usually, Plunkett would be the
celebrity in those second-row court
side seats. Not today. Vitale and
Musburger are sitting at the broad
cast desk to his right, while Woods is
with his fiancee, Elin Nordegren,
just a few seats to the left of Plun
kett in the front row. Vitale took
photos and signed autographs with
the Sixth Man before the game, and
a few students brought a sign im
ploring Nordegren, a Swedish mod

el, to marry them instead of Tiger.

That's not to mention the man
himself.

"Every time I ran down that
side of the court, I was sort of mind
ful that [Woods] was sitting right
there watching the game," Little
says. "And this was, like, pre-contro
versy Tiger. This was when Tiger
was untouchable, the best athlete in
the world."

For much of the game, No. 2
Stanford has looked like the best
team in the country, stretching its
lead to 12 points in the second half.
But Arizona has turned the tables
with a 14-0 run late in the game,

and a Stoudamire 3 has given the
Wildcats a 77-73 lead at the one
minute mark.
Childress sinks a free throw
with 44 seconds left to make it 77-
74. With a stop, Stanford will have a
chance to tie the game up with a 3-
pointer in the final moments.
Frye wastes no time inbound
ing the ball, flipping it to Shakur in
front of the Cardinal bench, but
Hernandez is there, swatting at the
pass and knocking it loose into the
corner. He dives at the ball, but
Shakur is quicker and scoops it up as
Hernandez goes flying into the row
of folding chairs. Shakur is immedi
ately pressured by Childress. He
muscles the Stanford forward to the
ground and lobs a pass over Lot
tich's outstretched arms to
Stoudamire. Lottich stumbles over
Childress.

All Stanford needed was a stop,
but it has taken just four seconds for
the broken play to put three Cardinal
players out of position.
Luckily for Stanford, Stoudamire
hesitates across midcourt, giving Lot
tich just enough time to catch up to
the play. The Cardinal's most com
petitive player makes a mad dash
past Stoudamire, forcing him to
spin toward where Woods is sit
ting, and by the time Hernandez
has made it to half court as well,
Stoudamire is facing his own bas
ket. Startled, he lofts an errant
pass to Shakur, but it's headed
over the half-court line. All Shakur
can do is catch the ball in midair
and launch an off-balance pass
back to Stoudamire.

Lottich leaps and knocks it
away.

He corrals the loose ball and

hurries downcourt. Thirty seconds
left, and Stanford's best 3-point
shooter has the ball. Lottich is
chased into the right corner by an
Arizona defender, and he's forced
to give it up, firing a pass to Her
nandez near the top of the key.
Hernandez flips it back to the
right, where Robinson is standing
behind the arc. For a split second,
he's open.
But like many a home-cooked
dinner, Robinson hands it over to a
teammate.

Hernandez catches the return
feed, takes a dribble left and finds
Childress, who has made his way
in front of the Cardinal bench
while his teammates were draw
ing the Wildcats to the opposite
corner. Childress is 6-foot-8, but
this is his favorite spot on the
court. His shot rattles in.

For a second, the Sixth Man
Club hangs in midair, returning to
the ground with a collective
thump. Tiger gives a rendition of
his trademark fist pump. Olson,
ever at odds with the elements at
Maples, calls timeout. 77-77.
"The crowd went nuts," Her
nandez remembers. "We all kind
of knew that it was our game."
At least for Stanford, no se
quence could better symbolize the
fundamental dichotomy of that ri
valry. The Wildcats' skilled but un
predictable playmakers had com
mitted a disastrous turnover,
while the team-oriented Cardinal
had capitalized by swinging the
ball around between four players
in as many seconds.
As the initial roar subsides,
anxious mumbles begin to fill
Maples. The clock reads 23.2 sec
onds, and Arizona has the ball
with no intention of giving it up.
The best the fans can hope for is
overtime.

But on the Cardinal bench, that
hopelessness never sets in. Mont
gomery is too busy calming his
team down, going over the defense.
Lottich points out that Stanford on
ly has five fouls, meaning it can
commit one more to throw off the
Wildcats' timing without risking any
free-throw attempts.
And so the huddles break, with
the Sixth Man exchanging "Go"s
with "Stanford"s from across the
court. That gives way to a unified,
drawn-out yell, and as the Sixth
Man begins to bounce, those old
wooden bleachers begin to rumble.

Robinson steps out onto the
court. He's played almost the entire
game, as Davis is still injured and
Haryasz sprained his ankle in prac
tice last week. With those two
healthy, maybe he would be taking
a seat right now instead.
Igoudala inbounds it to
Stoudamire, Arizona's best shooter,
and the clock ticks down.

Stoudamire takes it upcourt
slowly. Lottich watches him closely
across the midcourt line, blocking
his move to the left, and
Stoudamire bounces it back to
Igoudala, who is being guarded by
Robinson.

They want to get it to
Stoudamire, Vitale cautions. They
want to get it to Stoudamire.
Igoudala tosses it back to
Stoudamire in another awkward ex
change near midcourt; the crowd
lets out half a gasp, expecting a steal
that won't come. Ten seconds left.

"I'm hacking [Stoudamire],"
Lottich remembers. "I'm literally try
ing to get a foul called on me, and
they're not doing it. They were not
going to call it. I don't think the refs
knew [we had a foul to give]."
They've got to hurry now, sev
en seconds, Musburger replies.
Here he comes, it's one-on-one
with Lottich...

With his right arm on the ag

gressive Lottich, Stoudamire begins
to make his move. From in front of
the scorer's table, he dribbles slowly
to the top of the key, where Frye,
trailed by Little, is setting a screen.
Simultaneously, Igoudala wanders
from the left wing toward half court,
drawing Robinson to the same exact
spot.
... Lottich stays...
Frye releases from the screen a
bit too early. Five seconds left.
Stoudamire looks up. Lottich, Little
and Robinson surround him on three
sides.
He tries to pick up his dribble,
but Robinson tips the ball free.
... almost stolen...

It caroms off Lottich's left knee
and right into Robinson's hands. Her
nandez frantically signals for a time
out, but the refs don't call that ei
ther.

... they've got it! Two seconds!
ROBINSON...

Without thinking, Robinson
turns upcourt at full speed. He sees
the clock, takes two dribbles. They
carry him to half court, where he
picks up his dribble with just over a
second left. By the time the ball is
out of his hands, only a few tenths
remain.
... AT THE BUZZER...
"I was almost directly behind
Nick," Little says. 'All I remember is,

'Oh my god, that looks like it's going
in.'"

Robinson is looking too. The ball
hovers in flight for a brief moment as
he lands on his left foot, turned
around by the release. Robinson falls
to the court, still holding his stare,
just as the ball hits nylon.
"It felt good," Robinson remem
bers, "and it happened to go in."
... YES! YES! YES!...
Matt Lottich falls on Robinson
first. A split second later, he's joined
by Little and Hernandez. Childress
doesn't jump on top; he has a cramp.
'And then," Robinson says, "I
felt half the Sixth Man fall on top of
me."

... ROBINSON AT THE
BUZZER!...

"It got really heavy, really
quick," Lottich says. '!And I actually
got kind of scared. Like, 'Guys, get
off.' I started ripping people off of
Nick."

"I feel like I'm going to suffocate
in this big pile of people," little says.

...STANFORD STAYS UN
BEATEN!...
The entire Stanford bench races
to the growing dogpile except for
the Cardinal's fifth-year senior.
"I just wanted to make sure,"
Kirchofer says. "I did a double check,

was like, 'Alright, the score's on the
scoreboard, the ref said it's a 3, it's in
time,' all that kind of stuff. 'The
game's over.'"
... IT'S A MOB SCENE!...
"And then everybody was just
going crazy, and after I don't know
how long I was thinking this stuff, it
was a little bit of, 'Okay, let's make
sure Nick doesn't get crushed under
this pile. All right, everybody, calm
down, calm down. Back up a little
bit.' And then he stands up. 'Oh,
yeah, he's okay, he's alive! Let's par

Not everyone escapes un
scathed.
"They ran around me," Plunkett
says, "because I was obviously bigger
and stronger, but my wife got
knocked down and her leg got
caught in one of the folding chairs,
and they were using that as a tram
poline to get onto the court. So my
wife was hurt pretty severely."
... AN INCREDIBLE END
ING!...
In seconds, the Sixth Man
bleachers are empty. The floor starts
bouncing like it never has before. 'All
Right Now" is playing somewhere,
but it can't be heard over the crowd.
"Picture, like, the most populat
ed frat party you ever went to," Her
nandez says. "You just can't move.
That's what it felt like."
"I enjoyed the pandemonium,"
Childress remembers. "I don't know
about anybody else."
... CHILDRESS TIES IT WITH
A 3... AND... ROBINSON ON
THE STEAL... IT'S A RUNNER AT
THE BUZZER!
The team snakes its way
through the crowd and is whisked in
to the shelter of the hallway. Lottich
peeks back out, and he sees his best
friend hanging on the rim, riding a
wave of black Sixth Man Club t
shirts. The team makes its way into
the locker room, bear-hugging Robin
son all the way.
24 years old, Vitale says over
the highlight. His wife might have
the baby tonight! She's scheduled
to have a baby March 1! She'll prob
ably jump with joy!
That child will be named

"Buzzer-beater," Musburger jokes.
Buzzer-beater!
Back in the locker room a few
minutes later, Montgomery starts
giving his postgame speech to the
team. Tiger Woods pokes his head in.
Nordegren is with him; she checks
to make sure the players are all
dressed before coming inside.

Woods addresses the team
briefly, thanking the players for
pulling out the win. But that's not
what they will remember most.
"Tiger, great to see ya," the
quick-witted Montgomery says. "But
what the guys really want to know
is, does your fiancee have a younger
sister?"'
A big cheer goes up.
"Actually," Nordegren replies,
"I have an identical twin."
The locker room erupts. This
time, they're not constrained by the
weight of the Sixth Man. There's
screaming, laughing, dancing.
Someone asks for her number.
Montgomery, sensing that things
might be getting out of hand, finally
cautions his players to calm down.
Woods goes around the room,
shaking each player's hand. Finally,
he comes to Lottich, who is sitting
by the door. Lottich thanks Tiger for
coming.
"Great game, Matt," Woods
replies.
"And I remember being like,
'Wow, Tiger Woods knows my
name!"' Lottich says.
Outside, Maples is still bounc
ing.
♦ ♦♦
If you look closely at the court,
you can't see anything special; it's
just any other hardwood floor, just
sitting there.
And that's all it is. You can't
feel this one move.
A lot has changed in 10 years.
Tiger Woods is no longer untouch
able, Elin Nordegren is no longer
at Stanford basketball games and
the Maples Pavilion floor is no
longer springy.
Not long after Nick Robinson's
shot, that hallowed hardwood was
sawed off as part of a $26-million
renovation in 2004 that added a

concourse, a four-sided score
board, new locker rooms and re
tractable lower bowl seats in the
place of the old wooden bleachers.
The thinking was that the extra lit
tle bit of give in the surface actual
ly contributed to foot injuries, such
as those suffered by Chris Hernan
dez in 2002 and Josh Childress in
2003.

The floor was sold off to fans
that summer. A 9-inch by 9-inch
block went for $97, plus a $6 sur
charge. The email receipt, deliv
ered through the Stanford Athletic
Department's ticketing system,
gave the item a simple, fitting list
ing: "MAPLES."

"Actual Piece of Historic Stan
ford University Maples Pavilion
Floor, 1969-2004," the labels on
the blocks read. And those fans
were, indeed, purchasing their
own little piece of history. The fi
nal men's basketball game to be
played on that floor was a 76-55
win against Oregon that extended
No. 1 Stanford's school-record
winning streak to 25 games.
For the Cardinal, it was part of
a whirlwind month to end the sea
son. The team had hosted a baby
shower for Meagan not too long
before that Oregon win, which
served as an emotional Senior
Night for Josh Childress, Justin
Davis, Joe Kirchofer and Matt Lot
tich. Two days after the victory, An
nie Lee Robinson was born. March
1, right on time.

On the next weekend's road
trip, Stanford trailed a sub-,500
Washington State team by five
points with under 30 seconds left,
and in quick succession, a four
point play, a Cougars five-second vi
olation on the inbounds and a fade
away prayer by Lottich —at the
buzzer, of course kept the per
fect season going.

But 26-0 is where Stanford's
magic would end. On the verge of
becoming the first Pac-10 team to
ever finish its season perfect in con
ference play, the Cardinal lost its
18th and final conference game at
Washington.
"I think we honestly let the pressure get
to us," Hernandez says. "Every single day,
people would be asking us about the streak,
and becoming the first team in Pac-10 histo
ry to go undefeated in the regular season. I
think as a team, we just choked and let the
pressure get to us. And it was devastating."
Stanford got some measure of revenge
when it handled the Huskies in the Pac-10
Tournament Final. But the Cardinal wasn't
playing its best basketball anymore, and it
was knocked out of the NCAA Tournament
in the second round by eighth-seed Ala
bama.

A special season was left shrouded in
what-could-have-beens. No Final Four. No
perfect record. The conference title is re
markable in hindsight Stanford hasn't
won one since but at the time, it was the
fourth in six years for the Cardinal.

And so we were left with a moment
a shot. To varying degrees, it has stuck with
members of the 2003-04 hoops team as
well. Little says that when he sees a buzzer
beater every month or two, he instinctually
compares it with Robinson's. Hernandez is

taken back to the euphoria he felt in that
postgame celebration whenever he sees the
joy on the face of a player who has just made
a miraculous shot.

Yet for the man they called Pops, the
strongest memories are not the ones of the
Arizona game.
"I generally think about [the shot] when
people ask me about it," Robinson says. "I
think more about that team, and how special
that team was, how connected we were."
That game may be just a symbol of
something greater. But 10 years after it all
came together on one floor a heated ri
valry, waged in the final seconds for half a
decade; a jumping student section, forged in
a common bond of camping on cold con
crete; a team of champions, as diverse in
personality as it was unified in spirit it's
hard not to acknowledge the power of Feb.
7, 2004, the day when one impossible shot
made that floor bounce higher than ever.
The new Maples Pavilion turns 10 this
year. It hasn't seen a moment quite like that
one. Chances are, it never will.
