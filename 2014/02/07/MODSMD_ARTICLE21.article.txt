# ROBINSON'S SHOT, 10 YEARS LATER
## 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Annie Robinson turns 10 next
month, but her dad will be on a busi
ness trip that night. The Southern
Utah men's basketball team will be
in Missoula, Mont., and Pops has a
game to coach.
If you follow Stanford basket
ball, you probably don't know much
about the Thunderbirds. Yet you
have heard of Annie, maybe by a dif
ferent name, the one that broadcast
ers Brent Musburger and Dick Vi
tale proposed on national television
10 years ago today.
"Buzzer-beater."

Some call it "The Miracle at
Maples"; others, simply "The Shot."
But when Nick Robinson 'O4 M.A.
'O5 sunk a 35-foot runner as time
expired to give No. 2 Stanford an
80-77 win against No. 12 Arizona
sending Musburger and Vitale
into hysterics, the Sixth Man Club
onto the Maples Pavilion hardwood
and the Cardinal to a 20-0 record
there were, in truth, no words to de
scribe what had just happened.
Ten years after Robinson's icon
ic shot, that has changed.
"As a huge Stanford fan in pret
ty much any sport, this was one of
the greatest games I've ever been
to," Tiger Woods told The Daily
through his agent last month. "To
come back like that, and with that
type of shot, is something I'll never
forget."

"It's one of the best finishes
I've ever seen," added Heisman Tro
phy winner and Super Bowl MVP
Jim Plunkett '7l, who sat behind
Woods at the game. "It goes down
with the great Stanford historic mo
ments."

The moment itself has lingered
in the memories of Cardinal fans for
a decade, and it has stuck with

members of the 2003-04 hoops
team as well. Rob Little 'O5, then
Stanford's starting center, has a
framed photo in his house of Robin
son shooting the ball; Josh Childress
'O5, the team's star forward and a
seven-year NBA veteran, still gets
chills watching that clip.
But the story of Feb. 7,2004, is
not just one of an improbable steal
and an impossible shot. It's one of a
fierce West Coast rivalry, hitting its
unforgettable zenith; of a basketball
frenzied campus, converging on its
beloved stomping grounds for one
final season; of a 24-year-old utility
player, at once the odd man out and
his team's most respected member;
and of a group of 14 conference

champion teammates, the likes of
which haven't been seen on the
Farm since.

They were a team in the fullest
sense of the word, the phoenix that
rose out of the ashes of four NBA
departures—Jason and Jarron
Collins, Casey Jacobsen and Curtis
Borchardt in two years. That old
guard had set a new standard for
Cardinal men's basketball under
head coach Mike Montgomery,
starting the 2000-01 season 20-0,
holding the No. 1 spot for much of
that year and reaching the Elite
Eight.

Facing a significant experience
gap entering the 2002-03 season,

Stanford was picked to finish sev
enth in the Pac-10. But instead of
going their separate ways for the
summer, as most college players
did at the time, the entire Cardinal
roster stayed on campus to train.
They had seen an earlier generation
of teammates make Stanford an
elite college basketball program,
and they wanted to do the same.
The team finished second, and the
next summer, it followed the same
routine to prepare for the 2003-04
season.

"We felt that we had the talent
to [return to the top]," says the
team's junior point guard, Chris
Hernandez 'O5 M.A. 'O6. "We held
each other accountable, people

calling people up if they didn't
show up for a voluntary workout
and whatnot."

"Everyone was the one guy
trying to play the hardest in prac
tice every day," adds Joe Kirchofer
'O3, one of the team's three cap
tains. "It wasn't just one of us; it
was everybody trying to set that
tone, which made it really fun."
Most important was a lack of
ego from Stanford's top players, in
cluding from the most talented of
them all, Childress.
"Our best players wanted the
team to be successful more than
they wanted themselves to be sue-
