# Remembering more than just The Shot
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
Just last week, I stumbled across a
You Tube video of Matt Lottich's
dad cheering on his son at the
2004 Stanford-Arizona game.
The clip was only half a minute
long, but just five seconds in, something

caught my eye in
the background: a
little kid jumping
up to scream
about some bad
call.
Then I looked _
closer. The little
kid was me.

At first, I was
just caught off guard to see a 10-year-old
Joey on my computer screen. I'd actually
seen this clip before, and though I certainly
remembered sitting behind Lottich's en
thusiastic dad way back when, I was sur
prised that I hadn't discovered the video in
the six years since it was posted. And boy,
was Little Joey cute.
After a minute of letting that set in, I
couldn't help but laughing. Little Joey clear
ly screams, "WHAT!!! COME ON!" before
an exaggerated eye-roll and either a pro
longed boo or a cough, I can't tell which.
When I showed the video to my roommate,
he told me that I still react the same way to
bad calls at Stanford football games, 10
years later.

I watched the video again and
again, and again. Little Joey didn't just look
cute; he looked fierce.

And that's when the memories started
streaming in.

I was sure I remembered The Miracle
at Maples. Over the last decade, I'd com
pulsively watched and rewatched the last
minute of that game on VHS for a few
years, then, more recently, on You Tube.
Every pass, every steal, every shot became
second nature. What sporting event had I
attended that was quite like that one?
None, really. That game ranked at the top of
my list, and I wanted to burn it into my

memory as deep as possible, like a groove in
an old vinyl record.
But really, I had forgotten everything
until I saw the fire in Little Joey's eyes last
week.

That's when it all came back. The Sixth
Man Club, jumping up and down all game.
The jam-packed crowd, erupting after every
3, screaming after every bad call. The floor,
rumbling beneath my seat. Things were a bit
different back then.

That kind of stuff can't be captured by a
TV broadcast at least, not fully. I may have
thought I was paying homage to arguably the
greatest moment in Stanford sports history by
internalizing the highlight of Nick Robinson's
buzzer-beater, but in reality, I was reducing it
to just that: a buzzer-beater.
It was so refreshing talking to members
of the 2003-04 Cardinal because they re
membered that game and that season
for what it really was. Most of them had trou
ble recalling every detail of the final minute of
that game, but each and every one had vivid
memories of the personalities on their team,
the on-court celebration with the Sixth Man
and what it was like to be in that locker room
with their brothers in arms.

Those are the type of memories I tried to
infuse into today's 10th anniversary feature,
"The day Maples shook," alongside the high
lights and TV calls that have taken over that
game's legend during the last decade.
A lot of people turn to home videos for
reminders of the good old days. I turned to a
clip from my home away from home, Maples
Pavilion, for a reminder of Feb. 7, 2004, the
greatest day of them all.
Little Joey could teach Big Joey a thing or
two.

Big Joey Bey da's prolonged coughing fits fol
lowing bad calls at Stanford football games are
the reason why Stanford Stadium has a med
ical staff on hand. Tell Joey to express his con
sternation differently at jbeyda@stanford.edu.

That game
ranked at the top of
my list.
