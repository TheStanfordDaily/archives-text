Prospectus

"You can always tell a Stanford woman, but you can't tell her much."
This flip cliche has been applied many times to many situations. It is
not this writer's intention to chart the nature and extent of its truth. Specif
ically, however, we feel that it is valid with regard to fashion.
It is hard to believe that any woman on the Farm rushes to check her
attire with the latest Vogue of Harpers or even, more leisurely, to peruse
them studiously for "hints." And it is insane to conceive of a typical Stanford
woman eagerly scanning theses pages for guidance in dressing.
She has high fashion standards and what she doesn't know she is sure
is not important.

She may be wrong, but she's
never in doubt.

With these characters in mind
the editor and staff of the current
fashion edition of The Daily have set
about telling the Stanford woman
not what should or will be worn, but
what is actually being worn and
what is available to her. R.M.

Skirt Length Foil Experts; To
Stay Short

Rumors are rampant that
women's dresses will soon become
longer. From the historical view
point this forecast seems very un
likely. Instead, they shall probably re
main short until the war crisis is
over, if history follows its repetitious
habits.

For centuries clothes have been
a barometer of the times. In the
Grecian era men's clothes were
short to fit the active sports in which
they loved to participate. In the Mid
dle Ages the clothes were long to
hide the body that the Church
thought should be disregarded. The
Renaissance brought an era of ex
tremely elaborate clothes, suitable
to the formal court life of the times.
And so on through the ages.
During the 20th century
clothes have changed radically. Until
1915 they were long, but the first
World War brought in ankle-length
dresses. Women could not have the
necessary cloth and money to get
yards of material. Then there was a
short period after the War when
business was booming as a tempo
rary reaction. Skirts went down a lit
tle again; however, this soon
changed as we entered into the de
pression of 1929.

As we edge into the second
World War, hems have edged up too.
History makes it probably that we
shall not lengthen them again until
times become more settled. A silk
shortage is already evident, and
there may be other fabric shortages.
Unless history fails to repeat it
self — for the first time —we had
better become used to knees, good,
bad and indifferent.
