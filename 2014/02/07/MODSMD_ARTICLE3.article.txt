### Transcribed by Josie Hodson 
Afashion-themed edition of The Daily appeared on Wednesday, Nov.
12,1941. Below are two editorials that ran that day.

Prospectus

"You can always tell a Stanford woman, but you can't tell her much."
This flip cliche has been applied many times to many situations. It is
not this writer's intention to chart the nature and extent of its truth. Specif
ically, however, we feel that it is valid with regard to fashion.
It is hard to believe that any woman on the Farm rushes to check her
attire with the latest Vogue of Harpers or even, more leisurely, to peruse
them studiously for "hints." And it is insane to conceive of a typical Stanford
woman eagerly scanning theses pages for guidance in dressing.
She has high fashion standards and what she doesn't know she is sure
is not important.
