# Uché Uba
## Beaverton to Hugo Boss 
### GRACE CHAO 
While other students were busy shopping
and sight-seeing after class, Uche Üba 'l5 had
one more item than most students on his fall
2013 Barcelona study abroad agenda: attend go
sees.

Anyone who has watched Top Model can tell
you that go-sees meetings with designers
are how fashion models land many of their jobs.
At Stanford, Üba is a Human Biology-turned-Sci
ence, Technology & Society major; in the fashion
world, he has modeled for Hugo Boss, Nike Track
and famed Spanish label Llamazaras de Delgado.
"It's artistic and it's beautiful," Üba, who
spent this past weekend at Nike Headquarters
modeling in a show that allowed global buyers to
preview Nike's upcoming designs, said of model
ing. "And of course, I like clothes."

Üba was 14 when a friend showed him an
Adidas advertisement in a magazine. His friend,
along with former San Antonio Spurs star Tracy
McGrady, were both featured in an ad and
Üba's interest in modeling was sparked instantly.
"I was like, you get to meet all these people,
and it's art at the same time?" Üba said.

While many of his peers had started to get
jobs and buy nicer things for themselves, oppor
tunities in Üba's hometown of Beaverton, Ore.,
were limited.

"[Flipping burgers] was the last thing I want
ed to do," said Üba.

He submitted photos to a Portland agency
and was quickly signed to a two-year contract.
The agency soon turned out to be dubious, how
ever, and Üba realized that in order to become
successful, he would have to take it into his own
hands to grow and learn as a model.
"I had to figure out the industry for myself,"
he said.

Six months into his contract, Üba enrolled in
Captivist, a modeling program started by a profes
sional photographer, and spent three hours a day
working out, learning about nutrition, how to walk
and how to take pictures both in front of and
behind the camera. At the end of eight grueling
months, he was given the opportunity to choose
from one of Portland's top three modeling agen
cies and signed with Option Model and Media,
which he now considers his "family."
Five years later, Üba, who is interested in
biotechnology and marketing, has become an ex
pert at balancing schoolwork and modeling.
"You become a master of time," he said.
He said that he works out every day not

just for modeling, but also to maintain his own
"spirits and endeavors." When a job requires trav
eling, homework that can be done without Inter
net is saved for the plane. "Every 15 minutes,"
Üba joked, is planned beforehand with the help
of Google Calendar.

Keeping up with schoolwork, however, has
not been Üba's biggest challenge to modeling. As
a man of Nigerian descent, Üba said that being an
"ethnic model" that has posed the greatest diffi
culty.

"I was turned down at 95 per
cent of my go-sees [in Spain]," Üba
said. A designer finally told him
that because of his ethnicity,
and the country that he was in,
it would be much harder for
him to land a job.
"If you see certain eth
nicities in ads, then you
know that society is ready
to accept a person of that
ethnicity as a public fig
ure," Üba explained. "It's
not that people [in Spain]
aren't ready to accept
[black models]. It's that
the people in charge
aren't ready to give out
that power yet, and
there's a trickle down
effect,"

Üba said that he
briefly regretted not
studying in London or Paris
instead, given that there is al
ready a hub for black models in
those countries. He persisted in
his go-sees, however, and eventual
ly found jobs, including a major win
ter editorial with Llamazaras de Del
gado. The shoot, titled "Far Away
from California," has been re
blogged on Tumblr hundreds of
times since its January publication.
Ultimately, Üba said that he
wants his career to change what people
think about the world in a positive manner, citing
Ivory Coast-born model Adonis Bosso's work in
breaking down barriers in the fashion world and
actor Michael B. Jordan's work in bringing race
and gun-related issues to light through "Fruitvale
Station." While he is considering transitioning to

acting to have a bigger influence on his audi
ence, Üba's modeling career is far from over.
"[What I love about modeling] is actually
being part of something created," he said.
"When I see an amazing shot, I'm not think
ing that I looked great. I'm thinking that the
pieces, the scenery and the team came to
gether in an extraordinary and creatively ex
pressive way, [and] that's why I'm proud of
my work."

cies and signed with Option Model and Media,
which he now considers his "family."
Five years later, Üba, who is interested in
biotechnology and marketing, has become an ex
pert at balancing schoolwork and modeling.
"You become a master of time," he said.
He said that he works out every day not

just for modeling, but also to maintain his own
"spirits and endeavors." When a job requires trav
eling, homework that can be done without Inter
net is saved for the plane. "Every 15 minutes,"
Üba joked, is planned beforehand with the help
of Google Calendar.

Keeping up with schoolwork, however, has
not been Üba's biggest challenge to modeling. As
a man of Nigerian descent, Üba said that being an
"ethnic model" that has posed the greatest diffi
culty.

"I was turned down at 95 per
cent of my go-sees [in Spain]," Üba
said. A designer finally told him
that because of his ethnicity,
and the country that he was in,
it would be much harder for
him to land a job.
"If you see certain eth
nicities in ads, then you
know that society is ready
to accept a person of that
ethnicity as a public fig
ure," Üba explained. "It's
not that people [in Spain]
aren't ready to accept
[black models]. It's that
the people in charge
aren't ready to give out
that power yet, and
there's a trickle down
effect,"

Üba said that he
briefly regretted not
studying in London or Paris
instead, given that there is al
ready a hub for black models in
those countries. He persisted in
his go-sees, however, and eventual
ly found jobs, including a major win
ter editorial with Llamazaras de Del
gado. The shoot, titled "Far Away
from California," has been re
blogged on Tumblr hundreds of
times since its January publication.
Ultimately, Üba said that he
wants his career to change what people
think about the world in a positive manner, citing
Ivory Coast-born model Adonis Bosso's work in
breaking down barriers in the fashion world and
actor Michael B. Jordan's work in bringing race
and gun-related issues to light through "Fruitvale
Station." While he is considering transitioning to

acting to have a bigger influence on his audi
ence, Üba's modeling career is far from over.
"[What I love about modeling] is actually
being part of something created," he said.
"When I see an amazing shot, I'm not think
ing that I looked great. I'm thinking that the
pieces, the scenery and the team came to
gether in an extraordinary and creatively ex
pressive way, [and] that's why I'm proud of
my work."

While other students were busy shopping
and sight-seeing after class, Uche Üba 'l5 had
one more item than most students on his fall
2013 Barcelona study abroad agenda: attend go
sees.

Anyone who has watched Top Model can tell
you that go-sees meetings with designers
are how fashion models land many of their jobs.
At Stanford, Üba is a Human Biology-turned-Sci
ence, Technology & Society major; in the fashion
world, he has modeled for Hugo Boss, Nike Track
and famed Spanish label Llamazaras de Delgado.
"It's artistic and it's beautiful," Üba, who
spent this past weekend at Nike Headquarters
modeling in a show that allowed global buyers to
preview Nike's upcoming designs, said of model
ing. "And of course, I like clothes."

Üba was 14 when a friend showed him an
Adidas advertisement in a magazine. His friend,
along with former San Antonio Spurs star Tracy
McGrady, were both featured in an ad and
Üba's interest in modeling was sparked instantly.
"I was like, you get to meet all these people,
and it's art at the same time?" Üba said.

While many of his peers had started to get
jobs and buy nicer things for themselves, oppor
tunities in Üba's hometown of Beaverton, Ore.,
were limited.

"[Flipping burgers] was the last thing I want
ed to do," said Üba.

He submitted photos to a Portland agency
and was quickly signed to a two-year contract.
The agency soon turned out to be dubious, how
ever, and Üba realized that in order to become
successful, he would have to take it into his own
hands to grow and learn as a model.
"I had to figure out the industry for myself,"
he said.

Six months into his contract, Üba enrolled in
Captivist, a modeling program started by a profes
sional photographer, and spent three hours a day
working out, learning about nutrition, how to walk
and how to take pictures both in front of and
behind the camera. At the end of eight grueling
months, he was given the opportunity to choose
from one of Portland's top three modeling agen
cies and signed with Option Model and Media,
which he now considers his "family."
