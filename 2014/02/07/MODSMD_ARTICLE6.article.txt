## Berluti CEO talks luxury fashion 
### SARAH SALAMEH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Arts Institute held
the third event of its Fashion at Stan
ford Series on Feb. 4, hosting a con
versation with Berluti CEO Antoine
Arnault that spotlighted luxury.
Berluti's appearance followed
two earlier talks that focused on
fashion, retail and image making,
by Ron Johnson on Dec. 2 and An
nie Leibovitz and Pascal Dangin on
Jan. 9.

Berluti, a leather goods and
shoes brand, is part of the Paris
based luxury goods conglomerate
LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuit
ton S.A., of which Arnault's father,
Bernald Arnault, is chairman and
CEO. The younger Arnault has also
served as director of communica
tions for Louis Vuitton and, in 2013,
became president of Loro Piana.
"Luxury is a difficult object to
describe it's been the object of

hundreds of years of discussion," Ar
nault told Matthew Tiews M.A. '99
Ph.D. 'O4, executive director of arts
programs at Stanford, who moderat
ed the discussion. "We definitely
don't need it, but it's good for the
soul."

Arnault went on to describe the
intimate relationship between luxu
ry and time.

"I think to create brands such as
ours and to develop them takes time,
and many people when you ask
them what is luxury, they say time.
And in away it's true," he said. "It
takes time to create this history... It
is hundreds of years of work —it's
just something that is of the essence
of our products."
He emphasized the importance
of time both in the context of mak
ing products as well as for respecting
traditions vital to the success and
identity of the LVMH group brands.
In 2011, Arnault initiated the
"Journees Particulieres" project,

which gave behind-the-scenes access
to the Maisons of the LVMH group.
He started the project in response to
criticisms that his father focused
solely on the "bottom line" of his
businesses, such as outsourcing
manufacturing to developing
countries. These rumors com
pelled Arnault to "for one week
end, open our doors and transpar
ently show what happens in our
workshop."
Arnault highlighted his dedi
cation to time and tradition by em
phasizing not only how LVMH's
brands are exclusively manufactured
in Italy and France, but also how con
sumer and societal whims do not
compromise the essences of the
brands. When several audience
members inquired about Berluti and
LVMH's position on the growing
overlap of technology with fashion
and wearable technologies, Arnault
insisted that the brands would not
get involved with the nascent field.

"We need to focus on what we
know to do best, and our domain is
the highest quality in luxury prod
ucts and spending the most atten
tion on uncompromising quality, not
on being technologically advanced,"
he said.

Arnault concluded on an opti
mistic note in assessing the future of

luxury brands in America.
"You'll be surprised to know
that luxury in America grew faster in
2013 than [it did] in China," he said.
"So we've got a lot of optimism to
wards what's going on in America."
