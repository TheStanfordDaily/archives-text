# Freshmen launch fashion magazines
## 
### KATHERINE CARR 
Two student-run fashion magazines,
MINT and Pulse, have taken shape on cam
pus over the past few months in response to
a perceived lack of a diverse fashion commu
nity on campus.

Ashley Overbeek ' 17, editor-in-chief of
MINT Magazine, andAmeeqaAli 'l7, editor
in-chief of Pulse Magazine, both had fashion
on their mind when they arrived to Stanford
this past fall. After failing to identify fashion
publications at Stanford, both resolved to
make their own.

Both magazines seek to go beyond the
surface of fashion. Pulse seeks to encompass
other aspects of Stanford culture while
MINT aims to delve deep into fashion-related

issues, including queer fashion and the pres
sure of fashion on society.
MINT published its first online issue last
month and has already reached over
2,700 hits and will have print copies avail
able on campus in mid-February. Pulse Mag
azine is waiting for approval of voluntary stu
dent organization status from the ASSU but
plans to publish solely online this coming
spring.

MINT Magazine
"We came into Stanford guns a'blazing,"
Overbeek, who started her publication in fall
quarter with students that had expressed an
interest in the magazine through the Stan
ford Class of 2017 Facebook page, recalled.
Overbeek, dressed in a red velvet crop

top, Ray Bans glasses, sparkly embroidered
pants and holographic nails, said that she be
lieves no one should be told what is fashion
able or not, emphasizing that MINT Maga
zine is for all audiences and highlights all dif
ferent types of styles.
"Fashion is for everyone, not just those
who are rich or skinny," Overbeek said.
"Now it's less about label and more about
how you feel."
According to Overbeek, MINT strives to
highlight different trends sported by Stanford
students, as well as unique and quirky en
sembles that represent the individual, in ad
dition to showing off Stanford-originated art,
style, music and culture. The first issue fea
tured everything from artistic model shots
and details of the latest fashion trends, to
highlights on individual students' styles,
make-up tips and an interview with a cappella
group Fleet Street.

The models for MINT'S first issue were
Stanford students posing in their own
clothes, allowing them to express their
unique styles. The models, writers and pho
tographers submitted their information and

were selected through open calls.
"A lot of how we got the word out was
through the [MINT] Facebook page," Over
beek said.

According to Overbeek, however, the
first issue was "tame" and the magazine will
aim to take a deeper look at issues and to ex
pand beyond the Stanford community in
both content and readership. The second is
sue, which is planned for April, will move be
yond campus with the inclusion of a feature
on the band Mutual Benefit.
"MINT aims to have Stanford students
write about issues in the broader fashion and
culture world that inspire them, not just on
campus," Overbeek said.

Pulse Magazine
Drawing from her experience working at
startup fashion and culture magazine
One 1 One, in her hometown of Vancouver,
Ali wanted to feature fashion at Stanford in
her magazine while also featuring other di
mensions of campus life.
"Pulse Magazine's mission is to
expose Stanford students to the un
dergrad culture, including fashion,
music, events and food," Ali said.
"We go to school with an amazing
group of people, but people aren't
exposed to those outside their im
mediate social group."
Although Pulse Magazine
hasn't released its first issue yet, Ali
said that a solid team backs the pub
lication. Pulse Magazine board
member Justin Carl, who returned
to the University as a senior this
quarter after seven years of working
in Hollywood nightlife, entertain
ment and fashion, explained Pulse's

significance at Stanford.

"Then and now there has not
been a fashion, culture, art and
lifestyle magazine that places em
phasis on its realistic application and
importance to a Stanford student,"
he said. "I am excited to bring a new
level of style to the Stanford commu
nity."

While the team is excited for its
first issue, there have been several
unexpected challenges along the
way, including deciding on a name
or choosing the angle the publica
tion would take.
"The behind the scenes of a
magazine has an energy of its own,"
Ali said. "The rest of the year is go
ing to be a wild ride."

Ashley Overbeek ' 17, editor-in-chief of
MINT Magazine, andAmeeqaAli 'l7, editor
in-chief of Pulse Magazine, both had fashion
on their mind when they arrived to Stanford
this past fall. After failing to identify fashion
publications at Stanford, both resolved to
make their own.

Both magazines seek to go beyond the
surface of fashion. Pulse seeks to encompass
other aspects of Stanford culture while
MINT aims to delve deep into fashion-related

issues, including queer fashion and the pres
sure of fashion on society.
MINT published its first online issue last
month and has already reached over
2,700 hits and will have print copies avail
able on campus in mid-February. Pulse Mag
azine is waiting for approval of voluntary stu
dent organization status from the ASSU but
plans to publish solely online this coming
spring.

MINT Magazine
"We came into Stanford guns a'blazing,"
Overbeek, who started her publication in fall
quarter with students that had expressed an
interest in the magazine through the Stan
ford Class of 2017 Facebook page, recalled.
Overbeek, dressed in a red velvet crop

top, Ray Bans glasses, sparkly embroidered
pants and holographic nails, said that she be
lieves no one should be told what is fashion
able or not, emphasizing that MINT Maga
zine is for all audiences and highlights all dif
ferent types of styles.
"Fashion is for everyone, not just those
who are rich or skinny," Overbeek said.
"Now it's less about label and more about
how you feel."
According to Overbeek, MINT strives to
highlight different trends sported by Stanford
students, as well as unique and quirky en
sembles that represent the individual, in ad
dition to showing off Stanford-originated art,
style, music and culture. The first issue fea
tured everything from artistic model shots
and details of the latest fashion trends, to
highlights on individual students' styles,
make-up tips and an interview with a cappella
group Fleet Street.

The models for MINT'S first issue were
Stanford students posing in their own
clothes, allowing them to express their
unique styles. The models, writers and pho
tographers submitted their information and

were selected through open calls.
"A lot of how we got the word out was
through the [MINT] Facebook page," Over
beek said.

According to Overbeek, however, the
first issue was "tame" and the magazine will
aim to take a deeper look at issues and to ex
pand beyond the Stanford community in
both content and readership. The second is
sue, which is planned for April, will move be
yond campus with the inclusion of a feature
on the band Mutual Benefit.
"MINT aims to have Stanford students
write about issues in the broader fashion and
culture world that inspire them, not just on
campus," Overbeek said.

Pulse Magazine
Drawing from her experience working at
startup fashion and culture magazine
One 1 One, in her hometown of Vancouver,
Ali wanted to feature fashion at Stanford in
her magazine while also featuring other di
mensions of campus life.
"Pulse Magazine's mission is to
expose Stanford students to the un
dergrad culture, including fashion,
music, events and food," Ali said.
"We go to school with an amazing
group of people, but people aren't
exposed to those outside their im
mediate social group."
Although Pulse Magazine
hasn't released its first issue yet, Ali
said that a solid team backs the pub
lication. Pulse Magazine board
member Justin Carl, who returned
to the University as a senior this
quarter after seven years of working
in Hollywood nightlife, entertain
ment and fashion, explained Pulse's

significance at Stanford.

"Then and now there has not
been a fashion, culture, art and
lifestyle magazine that places em
phasis on its realistic application and
importance to a Stanford student,"
he said. "I am excited to bring a new
level of style to the Stanford commu
nity."

While the team is excited for its
first issue, there have been several
unexpected challenges along the
way, including deciding on a name
or choosing the angle the publica
tion would take.
"The behind the scenes of a
magazine has an energy of its own,"
Ali said. "The rest of the year is go
ing to be a wild ride."
