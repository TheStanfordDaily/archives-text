## OPINIONS Making Fashion Sustainable with Union Underground 
### ASHLEY OVERBEEK '17 Editor of MINT Magazine 
With the Stanford fountains recently
shut off for the rest of the year in
order to save water, sustainability
has been the word on everyone's lips. And
the fashion industry is especially in need of
sustainability. It takes over 1,800 gallons of
water to make a pair of jeans and about 400
gallons to make enough cotton for a t-shirt.
In addition to water consumption issues,
cotton, one of the most prolific fabric materi
als for apparel, is considered one of the 'dirt
iest' crops grown in the world because of the
insecticide use associated with it. Non-organ
ic cotton also requires a significant amount of
synthetic fertilizer to grow; almost a third of a
pound of synthetic fertilizer to produce the
amount of cotton for one t-shirt.

Where do these extra inputs go after per
forming their role in assisting fast and high
yield cotton production? Fertilizer will run off
into rivers and streams, creating hypoxic con
ditions that deplete oxygen levels for fish and
other marine organisms. Insecticides could
detrimentally affect farmworkers and laborers
who harvest the crop, especially since most
cotton is grown in developing countries with
fewer regulations or technology for handling
potent insecticides safely.

But does fashion with a conscience leave

us with shapeless jackets made from the same
material as recycled Arrowhead water bot
tles?

No. Like so many things in our lives, we
have overcomplicated our solutions. Why not
eschew purchasing new clothes, regardless of
how environmentally friendly they claim to
be, and instead look into buying clothes sec
ond-hand?

There's something to be said about thrift
ing. I have this jacket that I wear all the time;
it's a beat-up gray letterman with an American
flag patch on the back and the name "Theo"
embroidered on the left front pocket. Mainly, I
wear the jacket because it's warm and acts as a
much needed barrier against the piercing wind
when I bike. But I also wear it because I like to
think that Theo is out there somewhere, being
patriotic and wondering who is using his jacket
to keep warm on frosty mornings.
On Stanford's campus, we don't have an
excuse not to thrift; we have our very own sec
ondhand store on campus. Bonus: everything
in it is absolutely free. Union Underground (in
the basement underneath Axe and Palm in Old
Union) was founded in February 2011 and is
open from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m., Thursday
through Saturday. According to current direc
tor Justin Briggs, donations are composed of
big bags of clothes that are sorted by Union
Underground employees, and all members of
the community are welcome to stop by and
have anything from the store for free. If the
store gets too full, Union Underground do
nates items to a charity, ensuring that these
clothes, shoes and miscellaneous college ne
cessities don't go to waste.
Later on in life when I trade in my sweat
pants for something a little more business ca
sual, I'm going to donate my bomber jacket to
a thrift store in the hopes that this little piece
of history never rots in the back of a closet.
Sustainable fashion doesn't require cutting
edge technology. It's been right here all along.
