## Food Review PA's Greek infusion 
### RENJIE WONG FOOD DINING EDITOR 
"I'll tell you a secret, RJ."

Panos Gogonas, powerful
hand on my shoulder, steers my
dining companion and me across
the crowded dining salon. Navi
gating past crowded tables, the
charismatic general manager of
Ewia Estiatorio shows us to our
table in a quiet alcove.
"The Greek word for hospi
tality is philoxenia," he explains.
"That means making friends of
strangers, and as our guest
tonight, you are our friend."
It is just this Greek warmth
that consistently draws the glit
terati of Palo Alto to the restau
rant — Laurene Jobs MBA '9l is
seated two tables away and
makes it one of the finest estab
lishments in the neighborhood.
The food is a culinary odyssey
through Greece, with specialties
from across the country. The gi
gantes ($8.50), a specialty of the
Kozani region, takes two full days
to prepare, a process that includes
soaking the giant white beans, de
gassing them and then baking
them in a chunky tomato sauce.
The result is a meltingly tender
layer of legumes that carries the
crispness of dill-infused feta with
admirable grace.
The octapodaki tou yiorgou
($13.75) requires octopus to be
braised in a wine and vinegar
stock for precisely 80 minutes, be
fore resting for up to a day; each

order is then char-grilled over a
mesquite flame in a lemon
oregano olive oil dressing. The oc
topus' smoky flavor, intensified in
crispy bits of carcinogenic am
brosia, pairs perfectly with the
rich 2010 Sigalas Assyrtiko San
torini ($ll per glass), whose fine
sea salt finish transports you to
the rocky Aegean coastline.
Thanking Zeus my dining
companion is pescetarian, I pro
ceed to dive headfirst into the ar
nisia plevrakia ($11.75) —lamb
back ribs, braised in stock to ten
derize all connective tissues then
grilled to perfection, that take on
an immaculate succulence that
nigh approaches the Platonic ideal
of tastiness.

Nothing quite prepares me,
however, for the arnisia paidakia
($38.00), which I overhear the
next table ordering ("No, Eliza
beth, it's like nothing you've ever
tried"). Once the two hulking slabs
of grilled Australian lamb are set
down upon my plate, I embark up
on the Herculean task of prying
every strand of meat off the bone.
Each bite is an explosion of savory
goodness, and the earthy chocolate
flavors in my Moraitis Paros Re
serve 2008 ($ll per glass) bring
out the lamb's subtle sweetness.

My dining companion's psari
psito (market price as quoted), a
whole grilled Cyprus seabass sprin
kled with lemon juice, is an exer
cise in textural contrasts: crisp skin
