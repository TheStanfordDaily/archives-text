## Food Review PA's Greek infusion 
### RENJIE WONG FOOD DINING EDITOR 
"I'll tell you a secret, RJ."

Panos Gogonas, powerful
hand on my shoulder, steers my
dining companion and me across
the crowded dining salon. Navi
gating past crowded tables, the
charismatic general manager of
Ewia Estiatorio shows us to our
table in a quiet alcove.
"The Greek word for hospi
tality is philoxenia," he explains.
"That means making friends of
strangers, and as our guest
tonight, you are our friend."
It is just this Greek warmth
that consistently draws the glit
terati of Palo Alto to the restau
rant — Laurene Jobs MBA '9l is
seated two tables away and
makes it one of the finest estab
lishments in the neighborhood.
The food is a culinary odyssey
through Greece, with specialties
from across the country. The gi
gantes ($8.50), a specialty of the
Kozani region, takes two full days
to prepare, a process that includes
soaking the giant white beans, de
gassing them and then baking
them in a chunky tomato sauce.
The result is a meltingly tender
layer of legumes that carries the
crispness of dill-infused feta with
admirable grace.
The octapodaki tou yiorgou
($13.75) requires octopus to be
braised in a wine and vinegar
stock for precisely 80 minutes, be
fore resting for up to a day; each

order is then char-grilled over a
mesquite flame in a lemon
oregano olive oil dressing. The oc
topus' smoky flavor, intensified in
crispy bits of carcinogenic am
brosia, pairs perfectly with the
rich 2010 Sigalas Assyrtiko San
torini ($ll per glass), whose fine
sea salt finish transports you to
the rocky Aegean coastline.
Thanking Zeus my dining
companion is pescetarian, I pro
ceed to dive headfirst into the ar
nisia plevrakia ($11.75) —lamb
back ribs, braised in stock to ten
derize all connective tissues then
grilled to perfection, that take on
an immaculate succulence that
nigh approaches the Platonic ideal
of tastiness.

Nothing quite prepares me,
however, for the arnisia paidakia
($38.00), which I overhear the
next table ordering ("No, Eliza
beth, it's like nothing you've ever
tried"). Once the two hulking slabs
of grilled Australian lamb are set
down upon my plate, I embark up
on the Herculean task of prying
every strand of meat off the bone.
Each bite is an explosion of savory
goodness, and the earthy chocolate
flavors in my Moraitis Paros Re
serve 2008 ($ll per glass) bring
out the lamb's subtle sweetness.

My dining companion's psari
psito (market price as quoted), a
whole grilled Cyprus seabass sprin
kled with lemon juice, is an exer
cise in textural contrasts: crisp skin
crackles into creamy, flaky flesh,
pregnant with juices. All of this is
washed down, of course, with a
glass of Skouras Zoe Rose 2008 ($ 11
per glass), with its ripe cherry and
rose notes.

Because I categorically never
resist the siren call of glucose, we
try a wide range of desserts, in
cluding the yiaourti me xera frou
ta ($7.25), a generous mound of
dense Greek yogurt drenched in a
dried fruit compote and toasted
walnuts. Haunted by PTSD flash
backs of my disastrous low-carb di
et three years ago, I gingerly tuck
into the yogurt, only to discover
that there is nothing spartan about
this dish. We promptly unhinge
our jaws and work our way
through the dish.
Perhaps most outstanding,
however, are the melamakarona
($8.00), traditional Greek cookies
that are at once crispy and melt-in
your-mouth. The golden honey in
which they are soaked right after
baking provides a suitably satisfying
Midas touch and forms the perfect
foil to the bittersweet Greek coffee
($5.00), which packs a powerful
punch even in a cup the size of a
ping pong ball.
We wrap up our Bacchanalian
feast with a snifter of Metaxa Five
Star ($9), a sweet Greek brandy
bursting with flowery, raisiny fla
vors and just a whisper of oak. Less
of a dessert and more of a digestif is
the Tsilili tsipouro ($l2), a Greek
Grappa whose smooth nutty nose
gives way to a surprisingly long
licorice finish just what we
needed after our marathon meal.

We'd eat here every day if we
could, but the experience is so
breathtaking that lest you end
up dissatisfied with every other
restaurant on the block you'd
probably be best off saving this for
your finer meals. Ewia truly is eu
daimonia in an old friend's house.

($38.00), which I overhear the
next table ordering ("No, Eliza
beth, it's like nothing you've ever
tried"). Once the two hulking slabs
of grilled Australian lamb are set
down upon my plate, I embark up
on the Herculean task of prying
every strand of meat off the bone.
Each bite is an explosion of savory
goodness, and the earthy chocolate
flavors in my Moraitis Paros Re
serve 2008 ($ll per glass) bring
out the lamb's subtle sweetness.

My dining companion's psari
psito (market price as quoted), a
whole grilled Cyprus seabass sprin
kled with lemon juice, is an exer
cise in textural contrasts: crisp skin
crackles into creamy, flaky flesh,
pregnant with juices. All of this is
washed down, of course, with a
glass of Skouras Zoe Rose 2008 ($ 11
per glass), with its ripe cherry and
rose notes.

Because I categorically never
resist the siren call of glucose, we
try a wide range of desserts, in
cluding the yiaourti me xera frou
ta ($7.25), a generous mound of
dense Greek yogurt drenched in a
dried fruit compote and toasted
walnuts. Haunted by PTSD flash
backs of my disastrous low-carb di
et three years ago, I gingerly tuck
into the yogurt, only to discover
that there is nothing spartan about
this dish. We promptly unhinge
our jaws and work our way
through the dish.
Perhaps most outstanding,
however, are the melamakarona
($8.00), traditional Greek cookies
that are at once crispy and melt-in
your-mouth. The golden honey in
which they are soaked right after
baking provides a suitably satisfying
Midas touch and forms the perfect
foil to the bittersweet Greek coffee
($5.00), which packs a powerful
punch even in a cup the size of a
ping pong ball.
We wrap up our Bacchanalian
feast with a snifter of Metaxa Five
Star ($9), a sweet Greek brandy
bursting with flowery, raisiny fla
vors and just a whisper of oak. Less
of a dessert and more of a digestif is
the Tsilili tsipouro ($l2), a Greek
Grappa whose smooth nutty nose
gives way to a surprisingly long
licorice finish just what we
needed after our marathon meal.

We'd eat here every day if we
could, but the experience is so
breathtaking that lest you end
up dissatisfied with every other
restaurant on the block you'd
probably be best off saving this for
your finer meals. Ewia truly is eu
daimonia in an old friend's house.

"I'll tell you a secret, RJ."

Panos Gogonas, powerful
hand on my shoulder, steers my
dining companion and me across
the crowded dining salon. Navi
gating past crowded tables, the
charismatic general manager of
Ewia Estiatorio shows us to our
table in a quiet alcove.
"The Greek word for hospi
tality is philoxenia," he explains.
"That means making friends of
strangers, and as our guest
tonight, you are our friend."
It is just this Greek warmth
that consistently draws the glit
terati of Palo Alto to the restau
rant — Laurene Jobs MBA '9l is
seated two tables away and
makes it one of the finest estab
lishments in the neighborhood.
The food is a culinary odyssey
through Greece, with specialties
from across the country. The gi
gantes ($8.50), a specialty of the
Kozani region, takes two full days
to prepare, a process that includes
soaking the giant white beans, de
gassing them and then baking
them in a chunky tomato sauce.
The result is a meltingly tender
layer of legumes that carries the
crispness of dill-infused feta with
admirable grace.
The octapodaki tou yiorgou
($13.75) requires octopus to be
braised in a wine and vinegar
stock for precisely 80 minutes, be
fore resting for up to a day; each

order is then char-grilled over a
mesquite flame in a lemon
oregano olive oil dressing. The oc
topus' smoky flavor, intensified in
crispy bits of carcinogenic am
brosia, pairs perfectly with the
rich 2010 Sigalas Assyrtiko San
torini ($ll per glass), whose fine
sea salt finish transports you to
the rocky Aegean coastline.
Thanking Zeus my dining
companion is pescetarian, I pro
ceed to dive headfirst into the ar
nisia plevrakia ($11.75) —lamb
back ribs, braised in stock to ten
derize all connective tissues then
grilled to perfection, that take on
an immaculate succulence that
nigh approaches the Platonic ideal
of tastiness.

Nothing quite prepares me,
however, for the arnisia paidakia
($38.00), which I overhear the
next table ordering ("No, Eliza
beth, it's like nothing you've ever
tried"). Once the two hulking slabs
of grilled Australian lamb are set
