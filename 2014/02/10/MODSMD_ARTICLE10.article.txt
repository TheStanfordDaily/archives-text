## The 						importance of fan-player interactions 
### Michael Peterson 
Marcus Smart
crossed a line Sat
urday night, and
there's no coming
back for him.
The Oklahoma State point
guard and highly touted NBA
prospect fell into the stands after
chasing down a driving Texas Tech
basketball player and fouling him.
No. 19 Oklahoma State had just
turned the ball over trailing by two
with six seconds left, and it ap
peared that the Cowboys would
suffer an upset at the hands of the
Red Raiders.
Smart then found himself a few
steps away from the front row of a
hostile environment at Texas
Tech's home court in Lubbock,
Texas. As Smart rose to his feet, he
seemed to hear something coming
from a fan in the front row. Smart
appeared to banter with a fan be
fore moving closer to the front row.
That's when Smart did a very
unwise thing.
Smart shoved the fan with the
full force of both of his hands,
pushing him back into the crowd.
Smart headed back toward the
court before teammates rushed
over to pull him away. He then
turned and pointed back at the fan
while being pushed away by his
teammates. Smart received a tech
nical foul and refused to leave the
floor even after the game ended
with Texas Tech fans storming the
court, pleading his case until the
end and ultimately being dragged
off by team officials.
Interaction between players
and fans has always been a tricky
task to tackle. Fans cheering for
their favorite team, chasing play
ers down for autographs and
yelling support for their team al
most always works well for both
parties involved. The difficult deci
sions come with regard to fans and
their team's opposition.
Some fans won't boo the opposi
tion because they think that it's go
ing too far. Some refuse to boo a
specific player, while some boo but
won't say anything negative about
players. Of course, there are also
those fans that choose to yell pro
fusely at players with whatever lan
guage they choose. Where should
fans draw the line? Is booing a
player acceptable? What about
telling a player that he's no good?
Regardless of where you be
lieve the line should be drawn for
fans, one thing is certain. For ath
letes, responding to fans with neg
ativity, let alone physical violence,
is not an option. Ron Artest took
that route a decade ago when he
charged into the stands to attack a
fan and a whole team's even a
whole sport's reputation was
stained for a couple of years.
I'm not going to try to pretend
like I understand what Smart was
going through. He's in a difficult
stretch of the season, one that has
seen his team fall from No. 5 in the
nation to No. 19, and his perform
ance has fallen right along with it.
He watched Saturday as his team
mate fumbled away Oklahoma
State's last hope for winning a
game that the Cowboys really
should have won. We also have no
idea what that fan said.
But nothing could justify
Smart's actions. We place athletes
on a pedestal and although the
treatment they receive might not
always be fair, tearing back at fans
is only tearing away their own
foundation and ruining their own
reputation and their team's reputa
tion. Fans and athletes exist in a
symbiotic relationship in which
each should support the other and
neither should take to the extreme
and bring the other down.
For fans, there's absolutely no
need to tear down these athletes
that work hard day in and day out
to perfect their craft. Just because
they're on the opposing team does
not mean you can berate them
you certainly wouldn't appreciate it
if it were your team's player expe
riencing that treatment on the
road.
Like Colin Kaepernick and
Richard Sherman demonstrated in
Beats by Dre commercials, ath
letes need to tune out any negative
talk by choosing to ignore it. Ignor
ing the negative talk shows maturi
ty let your game do the talking.
Marcus Smart now faces hordes
of questions about his character
that will surely affect his draft
stock in addition to a three-game

suspension that will see him
miss part of the crucial finish
to the Big-12 conference
season because he failed to
remain calm in reacting to

an opposing fan.
Fans and athletes can't
operate without each other
and neither side should
take to verbally or physi
cally attacking the other.
When fans do cross the
line, it's important for ath
letes to stay above the
trash talking to avoid tar
nishing their own integrity

as well as the integrity of
their team and their sport.

In a shocking plot twist, it ac
tually turns out that Michael
Peterson ivas the fan at that
Oklahoma State-Texas Tech
game that incited the brawl.
Ask him what he said at mr
peters@stanford.edu or by
Tiveeting at him @mpetes93.
