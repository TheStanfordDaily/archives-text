# SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE
## CARD FALLS TO HUSKIES 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
No. 3 Stanford women's bas
ketball ventured through the snow
this weekend as it took on Wash
ington State on Friday and Wash
ington on Sunday. A narrow 77-69
win over the Cougars was just a
preview of the atypical play that
Stanford would produce on Sun
day against the Huskies, when the
Cardinal fell 87-82 in a game that it
never really controlled. It was
Stanford's first Pac-12 loss of the
season and second overall.

The Card started out the week
end with a dogfight of a game, as
the Cougars stayed within 10
throughout the game and even led
by one point with about seven min
utes remaining. The deciding fac
tor of the game was free-throw
shooting, as both teams struggled
until the end of the game with
shooting and turnovers. The
Cougars only shot 50 percent (10-
of-20) from the free-throw line,
while the Cardinal finished 13-of
-16 from the line.
In a game with a final score of
77-69, every point counted and de
spite Washington State's aggres
sive play from winning the
opening tip to snatching eight
steals the Cougars weren't able
to muster enough points to upset
the Pac-12's top team.
Against WSU, Stanford barely
held a 6-4 lead just over six min
utes into the game. At that point,
both teams already had three
turnovers and were shooting un
der 35 percent. It appeared that
neither team was ready to play.
Two 3-pointers from junior guard
Taylor Greenfield ultimately
helped spark a rally that put the

Card up by 10 with 4:57 to play in
the first half.
Greenfield provided the spark
off the bench that the Cardinal
needed to complement the ever
dominant play of senior forward
Chiney Ogwumike. Greenfield fin
ished with 11 points, going 3-of-4
from the 3-point line while grab
bing nine rebounds and passing
out five assists. Ogwumike led all
scorers as she tied her career-high
with 36 points and also grabbed 17
rebounds.
Going into the half, Stanford
led 28-24 after an Ogwumike mid
range buzzer-beater. With 11
turnovers, however, the team had
a lot of cleaning up to do in the
locker room.
Ogwumike came out of the
locker room on a mission and
scored four points in the first 45
seconds of the half, sparking the
fire that the Card needed to stay
ahead. WSU leaders Lia Galdeira
and Tia Presley also took their
team onto their shoulders and fin
ished the game with 21 and 20
points, respectively. However, it
was not enough, as Stanford pulled
out the victory.
On Sunday, it was Stanford that
couldn't deliver a come-from-be
hind win. After scoring the open
ing two points of the game, Stan
ford never led and trailed Wash
ington by as many as 16 with 9:38
to play in the game. The Card
lacked the same intensity and en
ergy that it struggled to find
against WSU. The offense was
slow in transition, forcing Stanford
to run through its plays on every
possession instead of capitalizing
on fast break opportunities.
Huskies freshman guard
Kelsey Plum arguably one of
the best freshmen in the country
had a sensational night, scoring
a career-high 23 points and shoot
ing 3-of-5 from the 3-point line. In
