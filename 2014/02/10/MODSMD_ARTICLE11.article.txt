# SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE
## CARD FALLS TO HUSKIES 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
No. 3 Stanford women's bas
ketball ventured through the snow
this weekend as it took on Wash
ington State on Friday and Wash
ington on Sunday. A narrow 77-69
win over the Cougars was just a
preview of the atypical play that
Stanford would produce on Sun
day against the Huskies, when the
Cardinal fell 87-82 in a game that it
never really controlled. It was
Stanford's first Pac-12 loss of the
season and second overall.

The Card started out the week
end with a dogfight of a game, as
the Cougars stayed within 10
throughout the game and even led
by one point with about seven min
utes remaining. The deciding fac
tor of the game was free-throw
shooting, as both teams struggled
until the end of the game with
shooting and turnovers. The
Cougars only shot 50 percent (10-
of-20) from the free-throw line,
while the Cardinal finished 13-of
-16 from the line.
In a game with a final score of
77-69, every point counted and de
spite Washington State's aggres
sive play from winning the
opening tip to snatching eight
steals the Cougars weren't able
to muster enough points to upset
the Pac-12's top team.
Against WSU, Stanford barely
held a 6-4 lead just over six min
utes into the game. At that point,
both teams already had three
turnovers and were shooting un
der 35 percent. It appeared that
neither team was ready to play.
Two 3-pointers from junior guard
Taylor Greenfield ultimately
helped spark a rally that put the

Card up by 10 with 4:57 to play in
the first half.
Greenfield provided the spark
off the bench that the Cardinal
needed to complement the ever
dominant play of senior forward
Chiney Ogwumike. Greenfield fin
ished with 11 points, going 3-of-4
from the 3-point line while grab
bing nine rebounds and passing
out five assists. Ogwumike led all
scorers as she tied her career-high
with 36 points and also grabbed 17
rebounds.
Going into the half, Stanford
led 28-24 after an Ogwumike mid
range buzzer-beater. With 11
turnovers, however, the team had
a lot of cleaning up to do in the
locker room.
Ogwumike came out of the
locker room on a mission and
scored four points in the first 45
seconds of the half, sparking the
fire that the Card needed to stay
ahead. WSU leaders Lia Galdeira
and Tia Presley also took their
team onto their shoulders and fin
ished the game with 21 and 20
points, respectively. However, it
was not enough, as Stanford pulled
out the victory.
On Sunday, it was Stanford that
couldn't deliver a come-from-be
hind win. After scoring the open
ing two points of the game, Stan
ford never led and trailed Wash
ington by as many as 16 with 9:38
to play in the game. The Card
lacked the same intensity and en
ergy that it struggled to find
against WSU. The offense was
slow in transition, forcing Stanford
to run through its plays on every
possession instead of capitalizing
on fast break opportunities.
Huskies freshman guard
Kelsey Plum arguably one of
the best freshmen in the country
had a sensational night, scoring
a career-high 23 points and shoot
ing 3-of-5 from the 3-point line. In

Fifth-year senior Mikaela Ruef (right) provided a key boost for Stanford
in an 87-82 loss to the Huskies, collecting career highs with 16 points
and 22 rebounds in the Card's first Pac- 12 loss of the 2014 season.
addition, four other Huskies
scored in double digits,
something that Stanford
was not accustomed to giv
ing up the last team to
have five players score in
double digits against the
Cardinal was Baylor in
2008. This was the Huskies'
first win over a top-five
team since 1990, when it
beat Stanford 81-78.
While the Washington
offense was spot-on, shoot
ing 40 percent from behind
the arc and 47 percent from
the field, its defense also
caused problems for the
Cardinal. The Huskies'
tight double team on Ogwu
mike was too much for the
Cardinal offense to handle
as it struggled to feed the
ball into Ogwumike, who
struggled to finish at the
basket. Ogwumike was held
to just 9-of-17 in shooting
but finished the game with
another double-double,
scoring 23 points and grab
bing 14 rebounds.

The real standout of the
game for Stanford was
fifth-year senior forward
Mikaela Ruef, who enjoyed
a career-best game. Ruef
grabbed a career-high 22
rebounds, which tied her
for third in Stanford's all
time record book for most
rebounds in a game. She al
so recorded a career-high in
scoring with 16 points.
Junior guard Bonnie
Samuelson (14 points) got
the game within four points
for the Card with 10 sec
onds on the clock by knock
ing down 3-pointers
something that Stanford
had struggled with all
game. On the next play,
Stanford forced a five-sec
ond inbounds violation on
Washington and got the ball
back. Ogwumike got fouled
on a missed layup and split
the free throws, putting
the Card within three.
However, with only five
seconds remaining and
Washington shooting so ef
ficiently from the line, it
was too little, too late for
the Cardinal.
Freshman guard Lili
Thompson was the fourth
Cardinal to score in double

digits with 13 points. Al
though Stanford was able to
generate some form of of
fense and had an even
spread in scoring, it could
not get the job done on de
fense, where it got beat by
players off the dribble and
didn't close out on open
shooters.

Even though Washing
ton owned the game from
the start, Stanford never
hung its head or had the
slightest look of defeat in its
eyes even when it was
down by nine with 30 sec
onds left. What was made
apparent in this loss was
the necessity for other play
ers to step up because
Washington proved that
Ogwumike is not entirely
impossible to defend. Every
player is important and has
to be accountable for each
and every game.

The Cardinal will return
to Maples this weekend to
play Arizona State on Fri
day at 7 p.m. and Arizona on
Sunday at noon in its second
meetings of the season
against both teams.

Fifth-year senior Mikaela Ruef (right) provided a key boost for Stanford
in an 87-82 loss to the Huskies, collecting career highs with 16 points
and 22 rebounds in the Card's first Pac- 12 loss of the 2014 season.
addition, four other Huskies
scored in double digits,
something that Stanford
was not accustomed to giv
ing up the last team to
have five players score in
double digits against the
Cardinal was Baylor in
2008. This was the Huskies'
first win over a top-five
team since 1990, when it
beat Stanford 81-78.
While the Washington
offense was spot-on, shoot
ing 40 percent from behind
the arc and 47 percent from
the field, its defense also
caused problems for the
Cardinal. The Huskies'
tight double team on Ogwu
mike was too much for the
Cardinal offense to handle
as it struggled to feed the
ball into Ogwumike, who
struggled to finish at the
basket. Ogwumike was held
to just 9-of-17 in shooting
but finished the game with
another double-double,
scoring 23 points and grab
bing 14 rebounds.

The real standout of the
game for Stanford was
fifth-year senior forward
Mikaela Ruef, who enjoyed
a career-best game. Ruef
grabbed a career-high 22
rebounds, which tied her
for third in Stanford's all
time record book for most
rebounds in a game. She al
so recorded a career-high in
scoring with 16 points.
Junior guard Bonnie
Samuelson (14 points) got
the game within four points
for the Card with 10 sec
onds on the clock by knock
ing down 3-pointers
something that Stanford
had struggled with all
game. On the next play,
Stanford forced a five-sec
ond inbounds violation on
Washington and got the ball
back. Ogwumike got fouled
on a missed layup and split
the free throws, putting
the Card within three.
However, with only five
seconds remaining and
Washington shooting so ef
ficiently from the line, it
was too little, too late for
the Cardinal.
Freshman guard Lili
Thompson was the fourth
Cardinal to score in double

digits with 13 points. Al
though Stanford was able to
generate some form of of
fense and had an even
spread in scoring, it could
not get the job done on de
fense, where it got beat by
players off the dribble and
didn't close out on open
shooters.

Even though Washing
ton owned the game from
the start, Stanford never
hung its head or had the
slightest look of defeat in its
eyes even when it was
down by nine with 30 sec
onds left. What was made
apparent in this loss was
the necessity for other play
ers to step up because
Washington proved that
Ogwumike is not entirely
impossible to defend. Every
player is important and has
to be accountable for each
and every game.

The Cardinal will return
to Maples this weekend to
play Arizona State on Fri
day at 7 p.m. and Arizona on
Sunday at noon in its second
meetings of the season
against both teams.

No. 3 Stanford women's bas
ketball ventured through the snow
this weekend as it took on Wash
ington State on Friday and Wash
ington on Sunday. A narrow 77-69
win over the Cougars was just a
preview of the atypical play that
Stanford would produce on Sun
day against the Huskies, when the
Cardinal fell 87-82 in a game that it
never really controlled. It was
Stanford's first Pac-12 loss of the
season and second overall.

The Card started out the week
end with a dogfight of a game, as
the Cougars stayed within 10
throughout the game and even led
by one point with about seven min
utes remaining. The deciding fac
tor of the game was free-throw
shooting, as both teams struggled
until the end of the game with
shooting and turnovers. The
Cougars only shot 50 percent (10-
of-20) from the free-throw line,
while the Cardinal finished 13-of
-16 from the line.
In a game with a final score of
77-69, every point counted and de
spite Washington State's aggres
sive play from winning the
opening tip to snatching eight
steals the Cougars weren't able
to muster enough points to upset
the Pac-12's top team.
Against WSU, Stanford barely
held a 6-4 lead just over six min
utes into the game. At that point,
both teams already had three
turnovers and were shooting un
der 35 percent. It appeared that
neither team was ready to play.
Two 3-pointers from junior guard
Taylor Greenfield ultimately
helped spark a rally that put the

Card up by 10 with 4:57 to play in
the first half.
Greenfield provided the spark
off the bench that the Cardinal
needed to complement the ever
dominant play of senior forward
Chiney Ogwumike. Greenfield fin
ished with 11 points, going 3-of-4
from the 3-point line while grab
bing nine rebounds and passing
out five assists. Ogwumike led all
scorers as she tied her career-high
with 36 points and also grabbed 17
rebounds.
Going into the half, Stanford
led 28-24 after an Ogwumike mid
range buzzer-beater. With 11
turnovers, however, the team had
a lot of cleaning up to do in the
locker room.
Ogwumike came out of the
locker room on a mission and
scored four points in the first 45
seconds of the half, sparking the
fire that the Card needed to stay
ahead. WSU leaders Lia Galdeira
and Tia Presley also took their
team onto their shoulders and fin
ished the game with 21 and 20
points, respectively. However, it
was not enough, as Stanford pulled
out the victory.
On Sunday, it was Stanford that
couldn't deliver a come-from-be
