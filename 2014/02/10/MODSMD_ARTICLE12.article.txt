# BRINGING THE HEAT
## 
### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford softball team
opened its season with an emphatic
showing at the Kajikawa Classic in
Tempe, Ariz., finishing the tourna
ment with a perfect 6-0 record as the
Cardinal rolled in a series of impres
sive victories. Although the quality
of competition at the Classic was not
nearly as high as it will be in later
non-conference tournaments and in
Pac-12 regular season play, Stanford
will nevertheless be able to draw
several positives from its outstand
ing showing this weekend, in which
the Card tallied five mercy-rule vic
tories and outscored its opponents
60-6.
In particular, Stanford's fresh
men all had great starts to their ca
reers on The Farm. In the circle,
Madi Schreyer and Carley Hoover
dominated opposing batters all
weekend long, yielding only six
earned runs in six starts. Schreyer, a
Woodinville, Wash, native, had an
outing to remember against West
ern Michigan on Saturday after
noon, as she and junior Nyree White
combined to no-hit the Broncos in a
15-0 rout.
Schreyer did not allow a single
baserunner in three innings of work
against WMU, exiting the contest
after throwing only 29 pitches. The
2012 Washington Gatorade Player of
the Year also had an efficient outing
on Friday morning against San
Diego State; Schreyer notched six
strikeouts while limiting the Aztecs
to three total baserunners and one
earned run over four innings in a 13-
1 win for the Card.
Schreyer did a great job of mini
mizing the number of walks she al
lowed throughout the weekend, as
she issued only six free passes in 13
innings of work while finishing with
a solid 2.7 strikeout-to-walk ratio.
Schreyer was also very successful at
keeping the ball in the infield in her
four appearances, as she totaled
four flyouts to 18 gi'oundouts while
not allowing a single extra-base hit.
Hoover also shined in her debut
for the Cardinal, as the Clemson,
S.C. product picked up wins against
North Carolina State and Indiana.
Although NCSU entered the Ka
jikawa Classic having received votes

in both ESPN.com/USA Softball
and the USA Today/NFSCA polls,
the Wolfpack had few answers in
matching up against the 2013
Gatorade National Player of the
Year.
After allowing a solo home run to
fellow freshman Molly Hutchison in
the top of the second inning, Hoover
scattered three hits over the next 4
innings to pick up the complete
game victory against N.C. State, a 9-
1 decision in favor of the Card.
Hoover had an even better perform
ance against the Hoosiers on Satur
day morning of the Classic. The
D.W Daniel High School graduate

only yielded a leadoff single in the
fourth inning to Erin Lehman in
four scoreless innings as Stanford
steamrolled Indiana 9-0.
The Cardinal also had a tremen
dous weekend at the plate, as Stan
ford hit .413 in
six games in the Arizona desert. In a
return to her home state, sopho
more and National Player of the
Year Watch List selection Kayla
Bonstrom validated her standing as
one of the elite players in the Pac-12
conference; the 2013 Pac-12 Fresh
man of the Year batted .467 in

the Kajikawa Classic with a .526 average through six games. Her strong
performances contributed to the Cardinal's perfect start to the season.
