stayed undefeated in dual
meets on the season with a
108-91 victory on Friday over
UC-Santa Barbara and a re
sounding 170-128 upset over
No. 4 USC on Saturday.

Stanford's win over UC-
Santa Barbara was its closest
margin of victory all season,
but the Card swam to victory
thanks to a strong opening
performance in Santa Bar
bara.
"Some of our swimmers
handled the challenge of rac
ing after a five-hour bus ride
better than others," said
men's swimming head coach
Ted Knapp to GoStanford.

better tomorrow."
The Card won the first six
events of the afternoon, in
cluding three by junior David
Nolan. Nolan narrowly won
the 50-yard freestyle in 20.67,
beating UCSB's Ryan Hanni
by just one-tenth of a second.
He then cruised to a more
comfortable victory in win
ning the 100-yard butterfly in
49.22. Nolan later contributed

performance in the 1000-
yard freestyle, as his time of
9:20.52 was more than 13 sec
onds ahead of the second
place finisher. Sophomore
Gray Umbach also signifi
cantly helped the Card with
victories in the 200-yard IM
and 100-yard backstroke with
times of 1:50.79 and 50.51, re
spectively.
Santa Barbara made a
late run to make the margin
of victory the Card's closest
of the season by winning the
100-yard freestyle and 400-
yard breaststroke, but the
Card prevailed on top of its
early domination.
On Saturday, Stanford

pulled off the upset of higher
ranked USC in arguably its
best performance of the sea
son.
"We competed very well
today against most of USC's
strengths," Knapp said.
"Our freshmen are really
starting to contribute, and
Daniel Le was a standout in
that sense."
Le won two individual
events —the 100-yard breast
stroke and 200-yard breast
stoke — and also raced the
breaststroke leg in the
Card's 400-yard IM victory.
His times of 54.97 in the 100-
yard breaststroke and
1:59.62 in the 200-yard
breaststroke were strong
enough to win each race by
about a second.

Nolan again won the 100-
yard backstroke in 48.84 but
fell to second in the 200-yard

backstroke as he was bested
by Cary Wright of USC, who
finished in 1:47.16.
On the first race of the
day, the 1,650-yard freestyle,
Stanford swimmers finished
first, second and third as
sophomore Danny Thomson,
freshman Justin Buck and
senior Bryan Offutt finished
before both of the Thojans who
were competing in the event.
Thomson again showed his
prowess in the long-distance
races, finishing 22 seconds
ahead of Buck, the second
place finisher, with a time of
15:01.41.
Stanford now enters a
break with two weeks off be
fore taking on California on

performance in the 1000-
yard freestyle, as his time of
9:20.52 was more than 13 sec
onds ahead of the second
place finisher. Sophomore
Gray Umbach also signifi
cantly helped the Card with
victories in the 200-yard IM
and 100-yard backstroke with
times of 1:50.79 and 50.51, re
spectively.
Santa Barbara made a
late run to make the margin
of victory the Card's closest
of the season by winning the
100-yard freestyle and 400-
yard breaststroke, but the
Card prevailed on top of its
early domination.
On Saturday, Stanford

pulled off the upset of higher
ranked USC in arguably its
best performance of the sea
son.
"We competed very well
today against most of USC's
strengths," Knapp said.
"Our freshmen are really
starting to contribute, and
Daniel Le was a standout in
that sense."
Le won two individual
events —the 100-yard breast
stroke and 200-yard breast
stoke — and also raced the
breaststroke leg in the
Card's 400-yard IM victory.
His times of 54.97 in the 100-
yard breaststroke and
1:59.62 in the 200-yard
breaststroke were strong
enough to win each race by
about a second.

Nolan again won the 100-
yard backstroke in 48.84 but
fell to second in the 200-yard

backstroke as he was bested
by Cary Wright of USC, who
finished in 1:47.16.
On the first race of the
day, the 1,650-yard freestyle,
Stanford swimmers finished
first, second and third as
sophomore Danny Thomson,
freshman Justin Buck and
senior Bryan Offutt finished
before both of the Thojans who
were competing in the event.
Thomson again showed his
prowess in the long-distance
races, finishing 22 seconds
ahead of Buck, the second
place finisher, with a time of
15:01.41.
Stanford now enters a
break with two weeks off be
fore taking on California on
Saturday, Feb. 22 at 11:00 a.m.
at the Avery Aquatic Center.
