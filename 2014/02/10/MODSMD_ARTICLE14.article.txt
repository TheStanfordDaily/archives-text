## LETTER FROM THE EDITOR Fighting Complacency 
### GEORGE CHEN '15 President editor in chief Vol. CCXLV 
On the fence of the Stanford
football practice field hangs a
banner that reads, "You are ei
ther getting better or you are getting
worse; you never stay the same."
The Stanford Daily will live by
that mantra this volume, even if
most of our staffers can't throw a
football that remotely resembles a
spiral.
For decades, The Daily has prid
ed itself on publishing a paper five
days a week. As an editor who has
worked in the Daily newsroom on a
regular basis for the last two vol
umes, I can tell you that getting a
paper out the door Sunday through
Thursday is no easy feat. Countless
dedicated staffers have stayed up
until the wee hours of the morning
working in a collective effort
that continues to astound me to
ensure that a paper will fall into the
hands of our readers without fail.
But it's easy to be lulled into
complacency. Publishing a paper
five days a week is the status quo
—it does not automatically make
us better, and if we think that it
makes us better, then we will only
get worse.
There are bigger goals that The
Daily hopes to achieve.
First and foremost, The Stan
ford Daily is a digital-first media
company. In this new digital age,
media organizations are struggling
to adapt to the constantly changing
landscape of the 24-hour news cycle
and the ever-expanding, reader
driven social media sphere. News is
no longer streamlined. Column
inches are no longer relevant. Dis
tribution strategies have given way
to search engine optimization.
These changes are new, quick and
sometimes frightening, and no
news organization can truly predict
where it will be in ten years.
But despite these changes, The
Daily wants to attack, not adapt.
We want to use our website and so
cial media to showcase content and
engage our readers in ways that we
have never done before. While we
continue to bring you accurate and

timely reporting, we will also strive
to package our content better
through increased use of multime
dia and graphics.
This volume, The Daily plans to
unveil a redesigned website to ac
complish those goals. Sleeker and
sharper, the site will allow readers
to fully interact and immerse them
selves with our content, be it a
sports feature or a photo gallery.
Social media will be integrated,
long-form writing will be presented
better and columnists will be given
more spotlight.
Stanforddaily.com will be better,
I promise you.
That is not to say that we are
shifting our focus away from our
print product. Launched in Sep
tember, the Weekend Edition has
covered major campus issues and
events, including the growing pres
ence of arts at Stanford, the 50th
reunion of LSJUMB and religious
life on campus. Our first Weekend
Edition of Volume 245, published
last Friday, included two covers,
one featuring fashion at Stanford
and the other the 10th anniversary
of Nick Robinson's legendary
buzzer-beater in Stanford basket
ball's unforgettable 80-77 victory
against Arizona. And in a few
weeks, we will be publishing a
Weekend Edition focusing on stu
dent-athletes.
The Weekend Edition has been
an exciting new project that we
look to develop even further this
volume as we constantly strive to
expand our readership by produc
ing content that is relevant to the
everyday student.
Fhom print to web, from stories
to photos, we at The Daily always
take pride in our work, and it is my
hope that this pride resonates with
our readers throughout the volume.
As always, thank you for reading.
