# The 						Many Paths of Success
## 
### Vihan Lakshman 
Let me make one thing un
equivocally clear: The goal of
this piece is not to ignite an
other debate over the value of sci
ences versus the humanities, or, as
its known around here, the "techie
fuzzy divide" a phrase that al
ways leaves a bad taste in my
mouth.
That topic was beaten to death
long ago.
Instead, I want to focus on a dif
ferent angle of the "techie-fuzzy"
debate one I believe more closely
aligns with the question we really in
tend to ask: "What does it mean to
be successful?"
Towards the end of November, I
was talking to my friend Alison who
had just returned from the "Last
Lecture" of retiring Stanford biolo
gy professor Robert Simoni.
Initially, Alison looked stunned
and confused, and I wasn't sure why
until she told me that only a handful
of people most of them colleagues
and current students had attend
ed Professor Simoni's lecture. I was
surprised, too, that one of the most
prolific professors in the Universi
ty's history Simoni had put in 42
years of teaching and groundbreak
ing research on cholesterol metabo
lism— would exit on such an un
derwhelming note.
At first, I thought the poor at
tendance at the lecture was proba
bly a result of insanely busy sched
ules of Stanford students. It's too
much to ask of students to take time
out of their day to hear someone
speak, right?
Well, I eventually realized that
that's not necessarily true. When
Facebook founder Mark Zucker
berg made his annual Fall Quarter
visit to CSIO6A, the Hewlett Teach
ing Center was stuffed to its limit
and then some. Many students
who were not even enrolled in the
course had arrived two hours be
forehand to secure the perfect seat
from which to hear Zuck dispense
his wisdom.
Clearly, there's nothing stopping
Stanford students from making the
effort to come listen to someone
who they actually want to hear.
So what, then, differentiates the
campus's response to Zuckerberg
versus Simoni? I believe that it has
something to do with the question I
asked in the beginning: "What con
stitutes being successful?"
In many ways, Mark Zucker
berg is the biggest hero within
Stanford's startup culture, a man

who summited a mountain that so
many are eager to climb; he's
young, brilliant, very wealthy and
created a product that is used by
hundreds of millions of people. In
fact, he has become somewhat of a
demigod on campus.
Simoni, meanwhile, became a
renowned authority on molecular
biology and the longtime chair of
one of the best departments in the
world through his commitment and
longevity. Through meticulous re
search and dedication to teaching
Simoni taught Bio 41 in each of
his 42 years he became one of the
best professors at Stanford and an
authority in his field.
Recently, Zuckerberg was back
on campus for a free-flowing con
versation with Stanford President
John Hennessy in a sold out Memo
rial Auditorium. While Hennessy,
the founder of MIPS Computer
Systems, and Zuckerberg are both
highly-regarded as giants in the
tech world, they devoted a signifi
cant chunk of the conversation to
discussing the apparent divide be
tween the humanities and technical
fields and, in particular, the inter
play between the two.
In the conversation, Hennessy
noted that much of the criticism di
rected towards studying the hu
manities in today's world stems
from a lack of immediate job
prospects; however, he argued that
this notion is flawed because "it's
not about the job you get right out
of college, but what you're doing 15
years from now."
For a long time, I was never re
ally sure that President Hennessy
was sincere when he talked about
the value of the humanities, but I
found his words during his conver
sation with Mark Zuckerberg to be
not only accurate but also genuine
and profound.
This idea that everyone needs to
study something in college and get
rich quick follows a very narrow
definition of success, one that Mark
Zuckerberg, the billionaire poster
child of this "startup culture," de
nies is the only path.
In particular, Zuckerberg sug
gested that college is not really
about finding that platform to get
rich right away (though there is
nothing inherently wrong with that)
but to explore and find interesting
problems and dive headfirst into
them with a willingness to cross dis
ciplines.

Those problems, be they design

ing solutions to meet the world's en
ergy demands, understanding why
some countries are rich and some
poor and exploring why certain
works of literature are so captivat
ing, are all questions that can be ex
plored from a variety of disciplines.
They encourage a strong sense of
creativity and imagination that is
truly universal.
Ultimately, exploring these ex
citing questions may not land you
the billions of dollars or the "per
fect" job right away, but they almost
certainly will instill the passion and
love of constant learning necessary
to stay afloat in an ever-changing
world. Everyone doesn't need to
achieve everything by age of 25
and this is not a techie-fnzzy debate;
Professor Simoni is a scientist, after
all. We need to respect and admire
the Robert Simoni approach be
cause we endanger ourselves if we
come to view instant gratification
and getting rich quickly as the only
acceptable forms of success.
Don't get me wrong. The world
needs more entrepreneurs like
Mark Zuckerberg. And the entre
preneurial spirit remains one of the
greatest features of the University.
However, this recent "startup cul
ture" phenomenon could use a dose
of perspective and an understanding
that there are many different ways
of being successful before getting to
that first billion before the age of 25.
My dream is that we can appre
ciate what Robert Simoni has done
with fervor equal to that with which
we appreciate the achievements of
Mark Zuckerberg. Similarly, by ap
preciating that success can take
many different forms, I hope that
we can appreciate the brilliant work
done by humanists as well as engi
neers with an understanding that a
love of learning and a desire to solve
problems whatever they may be
transcend all fields and any one
job.
Accepting that one can take
many different paths through life
and still be happy and fulfilled
that there are many different ways
to be successful aside from hitting a
home run right away may be just
what we need to bring this campus
closer together.
Special thanks to Alison
Nguyen for the inspiration to

world. Everyone doesn't need to
achieve everything by age of 25
and this is not a techie-fnzzy debate;
Professor Simoni is a scientist, after
all. We need to respect and admire
the Robert Simoni approach be
cause we endanger ourselves if we
come to view instant gratification
and getting rich quickly as the only
acceptable forms of success.
Don't get me wrong. The world
needs more entrepreneurs like
Mark Zuckerberg. And the entre
preneurial spirit remains one of the
greatest features of the University.
However, this recent "startup cul
ture" phenomenon could use a dose
of perspective and an understanding
that there are many different ways
of being successful before getting to
that first billion before the age of 25.
My dream is that we can appre
ciate what Robert Simoni has done
with fervor equal to that with which
we appreciate the achievements of
Mark Zuckerberg. Similarly, by ap
preciating that success can take
many different forms, I hope that
we can appreciate the brilliant work
done by humanists as well as engi
neers with an understanding that a
love of learning and a desire to solve
problems whatever they may be
transcend all fields and any one
job.
Accepting that one can take
many different paths through life
and still be happy and fulfilled
that there are many different ways
to be successful aside from hitting a
home run right away may be just
what we need to bring this campus
closer together.

Let me make one thing un
equivocally clear: The goal of
this piece is not to ignite an
other debate over the value of sci
ences versus the humanities, or, as
its known around here, the "techie
fuzzy divide" a phrase that al
ways leaves a bad taste in my
mouth.
That topic was beaten to death
long ago.
Instead, I want to focus on a dif
ferent angle of the "techie-fuzzy"
debate one I believe more closely
aligns with the question we really in
tend to ask: "What does it mean to
be successful?"
Towards the end of November, I
was talking to my friend Alison who
had just returned from the "Last
Lecture" of retiring Stanford biolo
gy professor Robert Simoni.
Initially, Alison looked stunned
and confused, and I wasn't sure why
until she told me that only a handful
of people most of them colleagues
and current students had attend
ed Professor Simoni's lecture. I was
surprised, too, that one of the most
prolific professors in the Universi
ty's history Simoni had put in 42
years of teaching and groundbreak
ing research on cholesterol metabo
lism— would exit on such an un
derwhelming note.
At first, I thought the poor at
tendance at the lecture was proba
bly a result of insanely busy sched
ules of Stanford students. It's too
much to ask of students to take time
out of their day to hear someone
speak, right?
Well, I eventually realized that
that's not necessarily true. When
Facebook founder Mark Zucker
berg made his annual Fall Quarter
visit to CSIO6A, the Hewlett Teach
ing Center was stuffed to its limit
and then some. Many students
who were not even enrolled in the
course had arrived two hours be
forehand to secure the perfect seat
from which to hear Zuck dispense
his wisdom.
Clearly, there's nothing stopping
Stanford students from making the
effort to come listen to someone
who they actually want to hear.
So what, then, differentiates the
campus's response to Zuckerberg
versus Simoni? I believe that it has
something to do with the question I
asked in the beginning: "What con
stitutes being successful?"
In many ways, Mark Zucker
berg is the biggest hero within
Stanford's startup culture, a man

who summited a mountain that so
many are eager to climb; he's
young, brilliant, very wealthy and
created a product that is used by
hundreds of millions of people. In
fact, he has become somewhat of a
demigod on campus.
Simoni, meanwhile, became a
renowned authority on molecular
biology and the longtime chair of
one of the best departments in the
world through his commitment and
longevity. Through meticulous re
search and dedication to teaching
Simoni taught Bio 41 in each of
his 42 years he became one of the
best professors at Stanford and an
authority in his field.
Recently, Zuckerberg was back
on campus for a free-flowing con
versation with Stanford President
John Hennessy in a sold out Memo
rial Auditorium. While Hennessy,
the founder of MIPS Computer
Systems, and Zuckerberg are both
highly-regarded as giants in the
tech world, they devoted a signifi
cant chunk of the conversation to
discussing the apparent divide be
tween the humanities and technical
fields and, in particular, the inter
play between the two.
In the conversation, Hennessy
noted that much of the criticism di
rected towards studying the hu
manities in today's world stems
from a lack of immediate job
prospects; however, he argued that
this notion is flawed because "it's
not about the job you get right out
of college, but what you're doing 15
years from now."
For a long time, I was never re
ally sure that President Hennessy
was sincere when he talked about
the value of the humanities, but I
found his words during his conver
sation with Mark Zuckerberg to be
not only accurate but also genuine
and profound.
This idea that everyone needs to
study something in college and get
rich quick follows a very narrow
definition of success, one that Mark
Zuckerberg, the billionaire poster
child of this "startup culture," de
nies is the only path.
In particular, Zuckerberg sug
gested that college is not really
about finding that platform to get
rich right away (though there is
nothing inherently wrong with that)
but to explore and find interesting
problems and dive headfirst into
them with a willingness to cross dis
ciplines.

Those problems, be they design

ing solutions to meet the world's en
ergy demands, understanding why
some countries are rich and some
poor and exploring why certain
works of literature are so captivat
ing, are all questions that can be ex
plored from a variety of disciplines.
They encourage a strong sense of
creativity and imagination that is
truly universal.
Ultimately, exploring these ex
citing questions may not land you
the billions of dollars or the "per
fect" job right away, but they almost
certainly will instill the passion and
love of constant learning necessary
to stay afloat in an ever-changing
world. Everyone doesn't need to
achieve everything by age of 25
and this is not a techie-fnzzy debate;
Professor Simoni is a scientist, after
