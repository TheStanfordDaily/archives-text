# The 						Revolving Door Keeps Turning: Stanford's Ties to Silicon Valley
## 
### Roneil Rumburg 
Stanford's faculty and Silicon
Valley are inseparably inter
twined.
Members of our engineering fac
ulty will at times build, advise or
work for Silicon Valley companies,
and some professors advise entre
preneurship-focused student or
ganizations like BASES or StartX,
which encourage students to ex
plore their interest in entrepre
neurship. Faculty often leave Stan
ford to found companies, and many
successful founders and leaders
come back to teach: Even President
Hennessy has deep industry ties af
ter founding and advising technolo
gy companies throughout his aca
demic career. Many of our most
well-known Computer Science fac
ulty members, like Mehran Sahami
'92 M.S. '93 Ph.D. '99, Andrew Ng

or David Cheriton, have had simul
taneous successful careers in acade
mia and industry.
Some have criticized this sort of
revolving door between Stanford
faculty and technology industry
leaders as being detrimental to the
purity of academia at Stanford.
Stanford's successful ties to Silicon
Valley do indeed draw external at
tention away from the humanities,
and with Computer Science recent
ly overtaking Human Biology as the
most popular major at Stanford,
one might be led to believe that stu
dents are studying engineering dis
ciplines for the wrong reasons.
Stanford's increasing ties be
tween research and industry are al
so often seen as detrimental be
cause the motivations of industry
may distract students from being
motivated purely by the pursuit of
knowledge for the sake of knowl
edge. I would argue, however, that
Stanford students do still have the
ability to choose to study whatever
they want.
Moreover, this problem is inde
pendent of Stanford's ties to the
tech industry. Some students are al
ways going to be drawn to studying
what is currently in vogue, whether
it's engineering, economics, busi
ness, finance or any other disci
pline, and when trends change this
group will move to whatever starts
trending next. Pursuing engineer
ing right now is fairly lucrative, but
if the tech industry cools down, this
class of students will be driven to
pursue other more lucrative fields.
Stanford could try to solve this
problem in a few different ways, but
severing ties to industry or weaken
ing the quality of the engineering
school would not be likely to im
prove students' confidence or free
dom to pursue their real passions.
I would also argue that research
linked to industry has some signifi
cant benefits. People often speak
about a sort of "valley of death" in
the commercialization of research,
referring to the difficulty of suc
cessfully making research break
throughs usable for the masses. In
most cases, research done in labs
never makes it into the hands of
consumers. Stronger ties between
research and industry could help
strengthen the path from research
to commercialization, because when
commercialization is considered
from the start, research findings
may end up being more usable in in
dustrial applications.
However, if all research were
linked to industry needs, important
breakthroughs or even complete
fields would likely never have been
discovered. Many of humanity's

greatest accomplishments have
come from undirected research.
Some sort of balance between these
two competing areas needs to be
maintained, but, if anything, it
seems that we need more practical
research to be done to overcome the
valley of death.
Stanford's mission statement, as
written on Explore Degrees, says
that the objective of the university
is "to qualify its students for per
sonal success, and direct usefulness
in life." Stanford was founded at a
time when academia was complete
ly disconnected from everyday life,
and for this reason the Stanford
family hoped to bridge the gap be
tween intellectualism and "useful
ness" by founding our university.
Given this mission, it seems in
evitable that faculty may want to
leave academia at times to broaden
their experience and gain some per
spective on what it takes to succeed
outside of the university. Stanford
was founded on the notion that edu
cation needs to be practically useful,
and it seems to me that the best
way to achieve "direct usefulness"
is to learn from those who have
been successful both in and out of
academia.

For those interested in industry,
Stanford has an unprecedented lev
el of access to industry leaders and
knowledge, but for those uninter
ested in Silicon Valley, there is noth
ing forcing them to pursue this
knowledge further. A true liberal
education should give students the
freedom to prepare themselves to
follow any path they choose,
whether it is in academia, industry
or somewhere else entirely, and
maintaining ties to industry gives
Stanford access to a body of knowl
edge that could never exist solely in
academia.

ing the quality of the engineering
school would not be likely to im
prove students' confidence or free
dom to pursue their real passions.
I would also argue that research
linked to industry has some signifi
cant benefits. People often speak
about a sort of "valley of death" in
the commercialization of research,
referring to the difficulty of suc
cessfully making research break
throughs usable for the masses. In
most cases, research done in labs
never makes it into the hands of
consumers. Stronger ties between
research and industry could help
strengthen the path from research
to commercialization, because when
commercialization is considered
from the start, research findings
may end up being more usable in in
dustrial applications.
However, if all research were
linked to industry needs, important
breakthroughs or even complete
fields would likely never have been
discovered. Many of humanity's

greatest accomplishments have
come from undirected research.
Some sort of balance between these
two competing areas needs to be
maintained, but, if anything, it
seems that we need more practical
research to be done to overcome the
valley of death.
Stanford's mission statement, as
written on Explore Degrees, says
that the objective of the university
is "to qualify its students for per
sonal success, and direct usefulness
in life." Stanford was founded at a
time when academia was complete
ly disconnected from everyday life,
and for this reason the Stanford
family hoped to bridge the gap be
tween intellectualism and "useful
ness" by founding our university.
Given this mission, it seems in
evitable that faculty may want to
leave academia at times to broaden
their experience and gain some per
spective on what it takes to succeed
outside of the university. Stanford
was founded on the notion that edu
cation needs to be practically useful,
and it seems to me that the best
way to achieve "direct usefulness"
is to learn from those who have
been successful both in and out of
academia.

For those interested in industry,
Stanford has an unprecedented lev
el of access to industry leaders and
knowledge, but for those uninter
ested in Silicon Valley, there is noth
ing forcing them to pursue this
knowledge further. A true liberal
education should give students the
freedom to prepare themselves to
follow any path they choose,
whether it is in academia, industry
or somewhere else entirely, and
maintaining ties to industry gives
Stanford access to a body of knowl
edge that could never exist solely in
academia.

We need more
practical research
to be done to
overcome the
"valley of death."

Stanford's faculty and Silicon
Valley are inseparably inter
twined.
Members of our engineering fac
ulty will at times build, advise or
work for Silicon Valley companies,
and some professors advise entre
preneurship-focused student or
ganizations like BASES or StartX,
which encourage students to ex
plore their interest in entrepre
neurship. Faculty often leave Stan
ford to found companies, and many
successful founders and leaders
come back to teach: Even President
Hennessy has deep industry ties af
ter founding and advising technolo
gy companies throughout his aca
demic career. Many of our most
well-known Computer Science fac
ulty members, like Mehran Sahami
'92 M.S. '93 Ph.D. '99, Andrew Ng

or David Cheriton, have had simul
taneous successful careers in acade
mia and industry.
Some have criticized this sort of
revolving door between Stanford
faculty and technology industry
leaders as being detrimental to the
purity of academia at Stanford.
Stanford's successful ties to Silicon
Valley do indeed draw external at
tention away from the humanities,
and with Computer Science recent
ly overtaking Human Biology as the
most popular major at Stanford,
one might be led to believe that stu
dents are studying engineering dis
ciplines for the wrong reasons.
Stanford's increasing ties be
tween research and industry are al
so often seen as detrimental be
cause the motivations of industry
may distract students from being
motivated purely by the pursuit of
knowledge for the sake of knowl
edge. I would argue, however, that
Stanford students do still have the
ability to choose to study whatever
they want.
Moreover, this problem is inde
pendent of Stanford's ties to the
tech industry. Some students are al
ways going to be drawn to studying
what is currently in vogue, whether
it's engineering, economics, busi
ness, finance or any other disci
pline, and when trends change this
group will move to whatever starts
trending next. Pursuing engineer
ing right now is fairly lucrative, but
if the tech industry cools down, this
class of students will be driven to
pursue other more lucrative fields.
Stanford could try to solve this
problem in a few different ways, but
severing ties to industry or weaken
ing the quality of the engineering
school would not be likely to im
prove students' confidence or free
dom to pursue their real passions.
