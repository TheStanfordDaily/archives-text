## Faculty to create PA tunnel art Light and sound piece to be installed in PA walkway 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
The Palo Alto Public Arts Com
mission recently approved an in
teractive art installation that will
display colorful gradations of LED
light and ambient music in the Uni
versity Avenue tunnel located un
der Alma St. and the Palo Alto Cal
train station.
Ala Ebtekar MFA 'O6, an artist
and a visiting lecturer of art and
art history at Stanford, and Binta
Ayofemi MFA 'O7, visiting artist at
the Institute for Diversity in the
Arts, will collaborate on the proj
ect.
In addition to serving an aes
thetic purpose, the installation will
also be affected by tunnel use data
the amount of traffic, weather,
time of day and day of the week
collected by sensors. The peak
number of commuters and pedes
trians will determine the color of
light and tempo of music that will
play in the tunnel three times a
day.
The art piece is a response to a
call from the Palo Alto Public Arts
Commission that sought to pro
gram temporary rotating public
art displays in the tunnels of Uni
versity Avenue. Ebtekar and Ay
ofemi's proposal, which was select
ed over other proposals, will re
main in the tunnels for up to a year.
Elise Demarzo, public art pro
gram manager at the City of Palo
Alto, worked with the Palo Alto
Public Arts commission panel,
which included members ranging
from Russ Cohen of the Palo Alto
Downtown Business and Profes
sional Association to artist Joey
Piziali, to make the final decision.
"I loved the idea of the sound el
ement being tied into an interac
tive app and possibly tying into lo
cal music generated from the Stan
ford campus, Palo Alto High
School, Gunn High School, Cub
berley Community Center or else
where," Demarzo said. "This has
the capacity to build community in
a new and different way."
The photo-sonorous displays
will take the idea of building com
munity to a new level, as the music
of the installation will pair Ebtekar
and Ayofemi's score with songs
gathered from suggestions the
public can submit via Twitter.
