# Moscow study abroad suspended
## Program to be restructured following faculty review 
### MARSHALL WATKINS EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
The Bing Overseas Studies Program (BOSP) in
Moscow has been indefinitely suspended pending a
review of the program's practices and objectives.
According to BOSP Director Ramon Saldivar, the
suspension will last through at least the 2014-15 aca
demic year. He framed the planned faculty review as
a continuation of the decision to reschedule next
year's Moscow program from fall quarter to spring in
order to better serve student interests.
"Given all of [the proposed changes] and the fact
that we were already deferring the program those
two quarters, I decided that it would be better to
reconeeive the program and not just reschedule it
to wipe the slate clean and say if we were to start
over, what kind of program would we like to have in
Russia?" Saldivar said.
"It's conceivable that we'll have something in
place for 2015-16," he added. "That's the earliest we
would have a really finalized plan."
Saldivar identified a more diverse and extensive
set of course offerings, greater integration of student
internships into the program and the incorporation
of more than one geographic site as potential areas
for discussion. He emphasized, however, that the his
torically limited interest in the Moscow program
hadn't played a major role in the decision.
"I'd rather have a small, really high quality pro
gram than a large program that [offers] less quality,"
he said. "The numbers always fluctuate within a to
tally acceptable range â€”lO-15,15-20... Those num
bers are totally acceptable as long as the program is
producing the kind of outcomes that we want it to."
Miguel Boluda 'l4, a peer advisor for the Moscow
program, noted that a meeting last week between
Saldivar and students who took part in the Moscow
program last quarter struck a largely positive tone.
"The general consensus was that everyone had
really terrific times," Boluda said. "Some of the
homestays didn't match up, which is something that
could happen with any BOSP program."
Saldivar framed last week's meeting as another
component of ongoing efforts to solicit student input
with regards to how BOSP
programs meet student
needs.
"Some of the issues that
led to the changing of the pro
gram from fall quarter to
spring quarter were a direct
result of that input," he noted.
While Saldivar and Bolu
da both expressed then- ex
pectation that the Moscow
program would return even
tually, Saldivar acknowledged

that the form that it could
take remains somewhat un
certain.
"The faculty community
are the ones who have to
weigh in on that," he said.
"My guess is that people are
going to say yes [to the pro
gram's continuation], but
maybe they'll want some
thing more dynamic, more
flexible... Historically, BOSP
has been a dynamic institu
tion. It's not set in stone that
just because we have been
somewhere, we'll always be
there."

In the interim, according
to Saldivar, BOSP will at

tempt to maintain the oppor
tunity for exposure to Russia
by developing other study
abroad initiatives like
Overseas Seminars or the re
cently announced partner
ship program in Istanbul
with a view towards imple
menting a long-term solution.
"We certainly have stu
dent interest, and we certain
ly have faculty... who are will
ing to put in their work to
make it happen," Saldivar
said. "The issue is how best to
do it."

students and faculty involved with the program expressed optimism that it will return.
