# STUDENT LIFE
## Sustainability at Stanford presented, critiqued 
### SOFIA FILIPPA 
The third annual "Keys to Sus
tainability" fair took place last Fri
day, bringing together student
groups, academic departments and
institutes focused on sustainability.
Besides raising awareness about
various ecological issues, the event
â€”which was organized by the Of
fice of Sustainability also aimed

to encourage students to join clubs
and pursue academic research and
internships related to conservation.
"My vision for 'Keys to Sustain
ability' is to give [students] an op
portunity to learn outside of the
classroom and gain leadership ex
perience," said Meghan Kearns, the
main event coordinator. "There are
tons of grants for students who
want to do sustainable projects.

This event will show them how they
can do that."
Attendees credited the fair with
providing them with valuable infor
mation about ways to pursue then
interests within the framework of
sustainability.
"I've always been very interest
ed in sustainability but I haven't re
ally found away of really following
through it at Stanford," said Tynan

Challenor 'l7. "This is sort of like a
nucleus with all the information, so
it seemed pretty helpful to come
and sort of see what was going on
there."
Stanford's sustainability short
comings
While student organization rep-
resentatives in attendance at
the fair credited the Univer
sity's commitment to sustain
ability, several emphasized
that room for improvement
from managing land de
velopment to handling the
current drought remains.
Amy Zuckerwise 'l5,
president of the Stanford In
stitute for Innovation in De
veloping Economies (SEED),
drew attention to sustainabil
ity issues on campus.
"They have just so much
construction and a lot of land
scaping that doesn't seem
very sustainable to me," she

said.
Meanwhile, Sophie Harri
son 'l6, a member of Fossil
Free Stanford, critiqued the
University's actions with re
gards to fossil fuels.
"Stanford has been pretty
ambitious about cutting our
greenhouse gas emissions
but doing that while investing
our money in the largest coal,
oil and gas companies is fun
damentally incompatible with
those values," Harrison said.
For Abhineet Gupta M.S.
'll Ph.D. 'l9, one of the most
pressing issues to be solved is
recycling and composting on
campus.
"There are not enough
composting bins around, but
then even [for] recycling, I
think things are not very
properly marked," he said.

"Different buildings will have
different classifications, so it
gets very confusing."
With California currently
experiencing a drought, vari
ous student organizations of
fered their take on the Uni
versity community's re
sponse. Sasha Brownsberger
'l4, co-president of Green
Council, applauded measures
such as turning off the foun
tains and reducing plant wa
tering.
"We ourselves are doing
what we can about that, with
dorm competitions to save
water," he said. "We'll chal
lenge Stanford students to
cut down on their water us
age."
