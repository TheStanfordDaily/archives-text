### SOFIA FILIPPA 
The third annual "Keys to Sus
tainability" fair took place last Fri
day, bringing together student
groups, academic departments and
institutes focused on sustainability.
Besides raising awareness about
various ecological issues, the event
â€”which was organized by the Of
fice of Sustainability also aimed

to encourage students to join clubs
and pursue academic research and
internships related to conservation.
"My vision for 'Keys to Sustain
ability' is to give [students] an op
portunity to learn outside of the
classroom and gain leadership ex
perience," said Meghan Kearns, the
main event coordinator. "There are
tons of grants for students who
want to do sustainable projects.

This event will show them how they
can do that."
Attendees credited the fair with
providing them with valuable infor
mation about ways to pursue then
interests within the framework of
sustainability.
"I've always been very interest
ed in sustainability but I haven't re
ally found away of really following
through it at Stanford," said Tynan

Challenor 'l7. "This is sort of like a
nucleus with all the information, so
it seemed pretty helpful to come
and sort of see what was going on
there."
