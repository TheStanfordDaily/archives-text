## Pandora co-founder talks music Tim Westergren '88 discusses company's origins, culture 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Last Thursday evening, Tim West
ergren 'BB, founder of Pandora, spoke
to the Stanford community about his
story and the origins of Pandora.
Clad in a simple hoodie and jeans,
Westergren explained how he, as a
young musician, had tried to create
ways to find new music.
"It was a notion that by under
standing somebody's music taste and
mapping musical DNA that I could
build a method for discovering music,"
Westergren said. "At the time, I was
not intending to build a radio product.
I was really just trying to solve the
discovery problem that I primarily
faced as a musician."
According to Westergren, Pando
ra, which was founded in 2000 and
which now has over 1,000 employees,
hasn't grown without hardship. The
company has competed extensively
with Apple and has had several con
troversial royalty battles.
Anjuli Felix, who manages the in
ternship program and university re
cruiting efforts, said that she wanted
Pandora's internship program
which was launched last year â€”to
have a twist.
"One thing I noticed when I was
doing this competitive research [on in
ternship programs] was that a lot of
companies didn't have a theme for
their research," Felix said.
Felix explained that Pandora in
terns meet with mentors in one-on
one meetings called "soundtracks"
and are given badges with their pho
tos, schools and names.
Paul Wilke, a communications di
rector at Pandora, described the com
pany's structure as very fluid and
flowing.
"Pandora has no offices. It's a very
open structure," Wilke said. "You
have conversations with people that
you don't normally deal with. It's very
open, and it's great because we get to
share ideas."
Westergren also discussed the
company's "nurturing" cul
ture, including unplanned
lunches with his employees.
Pandora's most recent de
velopment involved a light
ing ceremony for putting up
a sign on their Oakland
building.
"We have seven-foot tall
letters across the top of a
big building in Downtown
Oakland," Westergren said.

"We had a sign-lighting cer
emony and rented a deck of
a parking structure across
the street so everybody got
out there and looked across
and watched the sign light
up at night. It was a mo
ment I will not forget in a
long time."
Westergren later dis
cussed one of Pandora's main
services: reaching out to
artists and bringing them on
board. He estimated that the
firm has brought 5,000 previ
ously unknown artists to the
broader public.
"It's all about artists com

ing to Pandora and building a
set of features for them to
leverage the audience and
talk to the audience and help
it drive their careers," West
ergren said.
Despite the firm's multi
faceted approach to expan
sion, Westergren said that he
aims to keep Pandora and its
features simple.
"Our goal is to help some
body use it more effectively
without cluttering up that ex
perience," Westergren said.
