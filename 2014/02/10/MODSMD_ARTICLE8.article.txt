Last Thursday evening, Tim West
ergren 'BB, founder of Pandora, spoke
to the Stanford community about his
story and the origins of Pandora.
Clad in a simple hoodie and jeans,
Westergren explained how he, as a
young musician, had tried to create
ways to find new music.
"It was a notion that by under

company has competed extensively
with Apple and has had several con
troversial royalty battles.
Anjuli Felix, who manages the in
ternship program and university re
cruiting efforts, said that she wanted

have a twist.
"One thing I noticed when I was
doing this competitive research [on in
ternship programs] was that a lot of
companies didn't have a theme for
their research," Felix said.
Felix explained that Pandora in

and are given badges with their pho

Paul Wilke, a communications di
rector at Pandora, described the com

flowing.
"Pandora has no offices. It's a very
open structure," Wilke said. "You
have conversations with people that
you don't normally deal with. It's very
open, and it's great because we get to
share ideas."
Westergren also discussed the
