## Maples breeds success Triumphs at home after tough travels 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's volleyball
had an impressive weekend,
decisively winning two criti
cal matches at home. After
struggling on the road, Stan
ford has been regaining its
momentum, fighting its way
back towards the top of the
national rankings and find
ing its place in the MPSF.
The No. 7 ranked Cardinal is
now 7-4 overall and 4-4 in the
MPSF after sweeping both
UC San Diego and defending
national champion UC-
Irvine.

Stanford is currently on a
three-game winning streak,
having swept its last three
opponents at Maples Pavil
ion. Maples is proving to be
more and more of an advan
tage for the Cardinal due to
the loyal fan base that rallies
behind the team and creates
an unfriendly environment
for the opponent. The Cardi
nal has looked very confident
as a team in the last few
weeks, working through
some of the issues it strug
gled with at the start of con
ference play, when it lost its
first three MPSF matches.
Stanford faced UC-San
Diego in its first match of the
weekend. The Tritons had
yet to win a match this year
and Stanford made sure to
keep it that way, beating
UCSD by almost 10 points in
each set. Stanford was com
fortably in the lead the whole
match, winning 25-14, 25-16,
25-16. The Cardinal had its
best defensive performance
of the season, holding UCSD
to a .100 attack percentage
