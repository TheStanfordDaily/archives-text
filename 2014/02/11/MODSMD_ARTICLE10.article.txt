## Maples breeds success Triumphs at home after tough travels 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's volleyball
had an impressive weekend,
decisively winning two criti
cal matches at home. After
struggling on the road, Stan
ford has been regaining its
momentum, fighting its way
back towards the top of the
national rankings and find
ing its place in the MPSF.
The No. 7 ranked Cardinal is
now 7-4 overall and 4-4 in the
MPSF after sweeping both
UC San Diego and defending
national champion UC-
Irvine.

Stanford is currently on a
three-game winning streak,
having swept its last three
opponents at Maples Pavil
ion. Maples is proving to be
more and more of an advan
tage for the Cardinal due to
the loyal fan base that rallies
behind the team and creates
an unfriendly environment
for the opponent. The Cardi
nal has looked very confident
as a team in the last few
weeks, working through
some of the issues it strug
gled with at the start of con
ference play, when it lost its
first three MPSF matches.
Stanford faced UC-San
Diego in its first match of the
weekend. The Tritons had
yet to win a match this year
and Stanford made sure to
keep it that way, beating
UCSD by almost 10 points in
each set. Stanford was com
fortably in the lead the whole
match, winning 25-14, 25-16,
25-16. The Cardinal had its
best defensive performance
of the season, holding UCSD
to a .100 attack percentage

and out-blocking the Tritons
8.5 to 2. The Cardinal once
again demonstrated its abili
ty to use the service game as
an advantage with 12 aces
for the match. Stanford used
the match as an opportunity
to spread out playing time
among 14 different players,
including sophomores Madi
son Hayden and Joe Ctvrt
lik.
Stanford had to rest up
after Friday's match for the
earlier-than-normal start
time of 12:30 p.m. on Satur
day against UC-Irvine. The
Cardinal used its momentum
from the night before, con
tinuing its strong teamwork
and consistent hitting. Stan
ford won the match 25-20,
25-21, 25-19, coming from
behind in the back-and-forth
second set. Stanford had a

powerful offensive perform
ance against the No. 9
Anteaters, hitting .381 and
recording only 11 attack er
rors.

Senior outside hitter
Steven Irvin once again led
the team with 14 kills and a
terrific opening set in which
he hit 7-of-7 to push the Car
dinal to an early lead. Senior
Eric Mochalski also had a
dominant performance with
12 kills and a .526 hitting
percentage. Both players
have showed leadership so
far this season with their
ability to consistently per
form well.
Stanford was also able to
limit the Anteaters' normal
ly-powerful hitting perform
ance, out-blocking UC-
Irvine seven to four. No
player for UC-Irvine hit in
the double digits, with Jun
ior Zack La Cavera record
ing a team-best nine kills.
While UC-Irvine has not
had as impressive of a sea
son so far this year as its na

tional championship season
last year, the win is still an
important one for the Cardi
nal, as it is trying to estab
lish itself as a serious threat
in the MPSF.
"It was huge for us to
win both of these matches
this week," Mochalski said to
GoStanford.com. "We had a
bit of a rough start to the
conference. We've started to
figure some things out. I
think we are playing really
well. That is a very good
Irvine team that we just
beat. We are going to go into
next week with a lot of confi
dence."
Stanford will face Pacific
this Wednesday on the road
but will return to Maples to
play No. 4 BYU on Saturday.
Saturday's match will be on
Pac-12 Networks at 7 p.m.
for what will be a high
stakes match for the Cardi
nal.

ior Zack La Cavera record
ing a team-best nine kills.
While UC-Irvine has not
had as impressive of a sea
son so far this year as its na

tional championship season
last year, the win is still an
important one for the Cardi
nal, as it is trying to estab
lish itself as a serious threat
in the MPSF.
"It was huge for us to
win both of these matches
this week," Mochalski said to
GoStanford.com. "We had a
bit of a rough start to the
conference. We've started to
figure some things out. I
think we are playing really
well. That is a very good
Irvine team that we just
beat. We are going to go into
next week with a lot of confi
dence."
Stanford will face Pacific
this Wednesday on the road
but will return to Maples to
play No. 4 BYU on Saturday.
Saturday's match will be on
Pac-12 Networks at 7 p.m.
for what will be a high
stakes match for the Cardi
nal.

Stanford men's volleyball
had an impressive weekend,
decisively winning two criti
cal matches at home. After
struggling on the road, Stan
ford has been regaining its
momentum, fighting its way
back towards the top of the
national rankings and find
ing its place in the MPSF.
The No. 7 ranked Cardinal is
now 7-4 overall and 4-4 in the
MPSF after sweeping both
UC San Diego and defending
national champion UC-
Irvine.

Stanford is currently on a
three-game winning streak,
having swept its last three
opponents at Maples Pavil
ion. Maples is proving to be
more and more of an advan
tage for the Cardinal due to
the loyal fan base that rallies
behind the team and creates
an unfriendly environment
for the opponent. The Cardi
nal has looked very confident
as a team in the last few
weeks, working through
some of the issues it strug
gled with at the start of con
ference play, when it lost its
first three MPSF matches.
Stanford faced UC-San
Diego in its first match of the
weekend. The Tritons had
yet to win a match this year
and Stanford made sure to
keep it that way, beating
UCSD by almost 10 points in
each set. Stanford was com
fortably in the lead the whole
match, winning 25-14, 25-16,
25-16. The Cardinal had its
best defensive performance
of the season, holding UCSD
to a .100 attack percentage

and out-blocking the Tritons
8.5 to 2. The Cardinal once
again demonstrated its abili
ty to use the service game as
an advantage with 12 aces
for the match. Stanford used
the match as an opportunity
to spread out playing time
among 14 different players,
including sophomores Madi
son Hayden and Joe Ctvrt
lik.
Stanford had to rest up
after Friday's match for the
earlier-than-normal start
time of 12:30 p.m. on Satur
day against UC-Irvine. The
Cardinal used its momentum
from the night before, con
tinuing its strong teamwork
and consistent hitting. Stan
ford won the match 25-20,
25-21, 25-19, coming from
behind in the back-and-forth
second set. Stanford had a

powerful offensive perform
ance against the No. 9
Anteaters, hitting .381 and
recording only 11 attack er
rors.

Senior outside hitter
Steven Irvin once again led
the team with 14 kills and a
terrific opening set in which
he hit 7-of-7 to push the Car
dinal to an early lead. Senior
Eric Mochalski also had a
dominant performance with
12 kills and a .526 hitting
percentage. Both players
have showed leadership so
far this season with their
ability to consistently per
form well.
Stanford was also able to
limit the Anteaters' normal
ly-powerful hitting perform
ance, out-blocking UC-
Irvine seven to four. No
player for UC-Irvine hit in
the double digits, with Jun
ior Zack La Cavera record
ing a team-best nine kills.
