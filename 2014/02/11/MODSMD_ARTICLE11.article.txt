## SUPER TUESDAY Just Say No to Racial Drug Policies 
### Aimee Trujillo 
This past Sunday, the nation
mourned another life lost to
drugs. While autopsy results
of Phillip Seymour Hoffman remain
inconclusive, the circumstances of
the actor's death all point to a drug
overdose. And when news of this
came out, it was all too reminiscent
of June 2009 when Michael Jack
son's death was the top story.
These are the tragic stories that
tend to reignite the debate on drug
policy, but according to the Centers
for Disease Control, there are over
100 such drug overdose deaths per
day. Why are drug overdose rates
consistently increasing, and what
can the government do about it?
These are the questions that the
Obama administration has been at
tempting to answer in the construc
tion of a drug policy strategy for the
past four years. On April 24, the
2013 National Drug Control Strate
gy was released with plans to re
duce drug use and "protect public
health in America." This compre
hensive strategy first emphasizes
prevention, but also includes efforts
to create better access to treatment.
Obama's policy is a far cry from
a realization of Nixon's envisioned
"war on drugs" that criminalized
drug use, increased sentencing
penalties and inflated the size of
federal drug control agencies. Pub
lic outrage and an extreme fear of
drugs continued even through the
'Bos and '9os, with incarceration lev
els for nonviolent drug offenses in
creasing from 50,000 people to
400,000.
Despite conveying a valiant im
age of cracking down on crime, it is
often forgotten that these historical
drug prohibitions are rooted in
racial sentiments. Since the nine
teenth century, drug restrictions
have largely been set in response to
different waves of immigration.
American legislators began to make
linkages between drugs and the
feared or rejected groups in society.
Historically, anti-opium laws were
associated with a large influx of
Chinese immigrants, anti-cocaine
laws were seen as a reaction to
wards the black population and an
ti-marijuana laws were linked with
Mexican immigrant communities.
What is most troublesome,
though, is that these prejudicial un
dertones are still a large part of the
nation's drug policy today. A jour
nal article in Criminology states
that prisons are full of "minority
drug offenders... who in essence
are being punished for the 'crime' of
not accepting poverty or of being
addicted to cocaine." This is espe
cially prominent in the 100-1 dispar
ity in possession penalties for crack
cocaine versus powder cocaine
someone with five grams of crack
has the same five-year minimum
sentence as a powder cocaine defen
dant with 100 times that amount.
Moreover, it is hard to dissociate
these policy differences from the
fact that 80 percent of those incar
cerated for crack offenses are
African Americans, while powder
cocaine use is generally a drug of
choice for the white upper-class.
Obama finally addressed this
striking dichotomy in 2010 by sign-

ing in the Fair Sentencing Act,
which reduced the crack-powder
cocaine sentencing disparities to 18-
1. While the schism has been re
duced significantly, it is still a differ
ence that is much too large to be
overlooked.
The 2013 National Drug Control
Strategy proclaims that "drug poli
cy reform should be rooted in neu
roscience— not political science."
So why are racially-driven drug
policies of the past still influencing
drug policies of the 21st century?
The National Institute on Drug
Abuse found that the effects of co
caine on the brain are identical in
crack or powder form. If the princi
ples that underlie the new drug pol
icy are true, shouldn't it be clear ev
idence that there is no logical basis
for the policy differences?
Drug overdose deaths now sur
pass homicides and car accident fa
talities in America. Every one of
these deaths from drug overdoses
no matter the level of celebrity
or media attention —is a tragic
one. Most tragic of all is how pre
ventable these deaths could be with
adequate resources for treatment
provided by the government.
The death of Phillip Seymour
Hoffman is a deeply saddening
event and also a reminder that
drugs do not discriminate between
race, social class, gender or sexuali
ty. So why should drug policy?
A history of drug policy imple
mented with racial biases should
not continue to have an influence on
the drug policy today. These histor
ical practices of criminalizing drug
use and legislating harsh penalties
that have carried through into poli
cy today will not help people with
their drug addictions. There is no
better time than now to fix the sys
tematic racism and lack of treat
ment options within our drug policy.
The 2013 Strategy was a step in
the right direction, but the govern
ment must now live up to its prom
ises by providing better treatment
for everyone for drug addiction as a
scientific substance abuse disorder,
rather than criminalizing it differ
ently based on the demographic
that abuses it. Instead of blindly
fighting a war on drugs, we must
fight for government action on poli
cy reform to combat the real prob
lem the influence of past racism
on policies today.

ment must now live up to its prom
ises by providing better treatment
for everyone for drug addiction as a
scientific substance abuse disorder,
rather than criminalizing it differ
ently based on the demographic
that abuses it. Instead of blindly
fighting a war on drugs, we must
fight for government action on poli
cy reform to combat the real prob
lem the influence of past racism
on policies today.

There is no
better time than
now to fix the
systemic
racism...within
our drug policy.

This past Sunday, the nation
mourned another life lost to
drugs. While autopsy results
of Phillip Seymour Hoffman remain
inconclusive, the circumstances of
the actor's death all point to a drug
overdose. And when news of this
came out, it was all too reminiscent
of June 2009 when Michael Jack
son's death was the top story.
These are the tragic stories that
tend to reignite the debate on drug
policy, but according to the Centers
for Disease Control, there are over
100 such drug overdose deaths per
day. Why are drug overdose rates
consistently increasing, and what
can the government do about it?
These are the questions that the
Obama administration has been at
tempting to answer in the construc
tion of a drug policy strategy for the
past four years. On April 24, the
2013 National Drug Control Strate
gy was released with plans to re
duce drug use and "protect public
health in America." This compre
hensive strategy first emphasizes
prevention, but also includes efforts
to create better access to treatment.
Obama's policy is a far cry from
a realization of Nixon's envisioned
"war on drugs" that criminalized
drug use, increased sentencing
penalties and inflated the size of
federal drug control agencies. Pub
lic outrage and an extreme fear of
drugs continued even through the
'Bos and '9os, with incarceration lev
els for nonviolent drug offenses in
creasing from 50,000 people to
400,000.
Despite conveying a valiant im
age of cracking down on crime, it is
often forgotten that these historical
drug prohibitions are rooted in
racial sentiments. Since the nine
teenth century, drug restrictions
have largely been set in response to
different waves of immigration.
American legislators began to make
linkages between drugs and the
feared or rejected groups in society.
Historically, anti-opium laws were
associated with a large influx of
Chinese immigrants, anti-cocaine
laws were seen as a reaction to
wards the black population and an
ti-marijuana laws were linked with
Mexican immigrant communities.
What is most troublesome,
though, is that these prejudicial un
dertones are still a large part of the
nation's drug policy today. A jour
nal article in Criminology states
that prisons are full of "minority
drug offenders... who in essence
are being punished for the 'crime' of
not accepting poverty or of being
addicted to cocaine." This is espe
cially prominent in the 100-1 dispar
ity in possession penalties for crack
cocaine versus powder cocaine
someone with five grams of crack
has the same five-year minimum
sentence as a powder cocaine defen
dant with 100 times that amount.
Moreover, it is hard to dissociate
these policy differences from the
fact that 80 percent of those incar
cerated for crack offenses are
African Americans, while powder
cocaine use is generally a drug of
choice for the white upper-class.
Obama finally addressed this
striking dichotomy in 2010 by sign-

ing in the Fair Sentencing Act,
which reduced the crack-powder
cocaine sentencing disparities to 18-
1. While the schism has been re
duced significantly, it is still a differ
ence that is much too large to be
overlooked.
The 2013 National Drug Control
Strategy proclaims that "drug poli
cy reform should be rooted in neu
roscience— not political science."
So why are racially-driven drug
policies of the past still influencing
drug policies of the 21st century?
The National Institute on Drug
Abuse found that the effects of co
caine on the brain are identical in
crack or powder form. If the princi
ples that underlie the new drug pol
icy are true, shouldn't it be clear ev
idence that there is no logical basis
for the policy differences?
Drug overdose deaths now sur
pass homicides and car accident fa
talities in America. Every one of
these deaths from drug overdoses
no matter the level of celebrity
or media attention —is a tragic
one. Most tragic of all is how pre
ventable these deaths could be with
adequate resources for treatment
provided by the government.
The death of Phillip Seymour
Hoffman is a deeply saddening
event and also a reminder that
drugs do not discriminate between
race, social class, gender or sexuali
ty. So why should drug policy?
A history of drug policy imple
mented with racial biases should
not continue to have an influence on
the drug policy today. These histor
ical practices of criminalizing drug
use and legislating harsh penalties
that have carried through into poli
cy today will not help people with
their drug addictions. There is no
better time than now to fix the sys
tematic racism and lack of treat
ment options within our drug policy.
