## The 						Case for Legalization 
### Anthony Ghosn 
There is really no way to argue
that the country's current
drug policy is successful.
The war on drugs costs the U.S.
taxpayers $4O billion a year, yet the
United States is the still the largest
illegal drug consumer in the world
by far. As a percentage of our popu
lation, we lead the world in cocaine
use, eclipsing the next biggest, New
Zealand, by a factor of four. Drug of
fenses are the primary cause for
federal incarceration: 50 percent of
men and women in federal prison
are being held for drug-related
crimes.
Evidently, our approach to regu
lating drugs is not working in its
current form, and we need to devise
a new strategy.
Legalizing drugs would be a
great first step. Punishing victim
less crimes is a violation of basic
freedoms of choice. According to
many people, under certain sets of
situations this trade-off—law and
order in exchange for personal lib
erty— makes sense. With regards
to drugs, however, I believe that by
legislating substance use and distri
bution, we are merely conceding

control to the black market. Instead
of being channeled through indus
tries that can be monitored by the
people, drug distribution falls upon
those disenchanted with traditional
methods of social mobility.
As the penalty for selling and
distributing drugs increases, so
does the market incentive the
salary of the increasingly scarce and
increasingly valuable drug dealers.
The growth of this incentive is usu
ally correlated to school dropout
rates in areas with a lot of drug traf
ficking— unfortunately racial mi
norities bear the brunt of this effect.
Sociologist Sudhir Venkatesh
documents the social effects of the
prevalence of the illegal drug trade
in Chicago in his book "Gang
Leader for a Day." Venkatesh points
to the geographical fractionalization
and consequential gang wars that
stem from fighting over distribution
channels.
By keeping drugs in the black
market, we are essentially damning
entire subsections of society to live
in an extremely violent and drug
laden environment. Fifty percent of
street crimes in Chicago are caused
by gangs fighting over drug distri
bution.
Even on an international level,
consider who is supplying the black
market with these drugs. Heroin
mainly flows out of rural
Afghanistan where its revenues are
shared between farmers and the
Taliban. Marijuana and cocaine
from Central and South America
are responsible for the deep corrup
tion and crime problems that afflict
countries like Mexico. As American
drug policy currently stands, it is a
lose-lose situation. Everyone is in a
bad place.
Let's legalize all drugs. People
who disagree with this theory often
think that I am supporting the de
struction of society. I would argue
that if we were to legalize drugs, we
would have less problems stemming
from drug use. First and foremost,
it has become clear that drug use is
an undeniable social reality, and that
it is impossible to banish completely
unless we employ draconian, free
dom-suppressing laws like those in
Singapore.
Given this reality, let us honestly
weigh what could happen if we were
to legalize drug distribution and use.
Most clearly, the formerly illegal
drug supply chains would evapo
rate: legal drug manufacturers
would have more affordable prod
ucts, given that they do not have to
worry about smuggling costs.
Decriminalizing drugs would re
duce the costs of incarcerating crim-

inals significantly and eliminate a
main criminal vocation in some of
the most sensitive parts of our coun
try. Children who might otherwise
have become drug dealers would
have fewer options outside of going
to school and getting regular; legal
jobs. The main cause for strife in
high-risk neighborhoods would
eventually dissipate, drastically re
ducing the incidence of gang-related
murder and violent crime. The risk
of drugs containing tertiary sub
stances would also fall due to the
fact that competitive market forces
would set standards for quality and
transparency.
As for drug users, I believe that
the market would react by having
stricter drug tests for jobs and
schools. Although drug use would
not be punished by the government,
the social tradeoffs would most like
ly become much clearer than they
are now.
Life will not be that different:
Like alcohol, I imagine that drug
use on the job will not be tolerated.
Similarly, social security programs
such as the evaluation of the ability
of parents to rear children will con
tinue to take drug use into consider
ation. It's possible that drug de
pendency will force more people in
to an underclass of drug addicts
who are totally disconnected from
society, but this will be a social
tradeoff that will hopefully further
highlight an incentive to not actual
ly abuse drugs.
Legalizing drugs, however,
should be done through Congress
as opposed to executive decriminal
ization. Obama's current policy of
skirting the legislative process to
decriminalize marijuana sets a dan
gerous precedent for the abuse of
executive powers.
It is clear that the criminaliza
tion of drugs cannot stomp out the
market forces sustaining them. Giv
en that the market for drugs will
persist, we might as well eliminate
the multitude of consequences I
mentioned above by legalizing it.
Not all seemingly moral prob
lems have moral solutions. We must
think beyond our impulse to punish
the bad and find responses that will
work in practice. The prevalence of
drugs is a social symptom, not an is
sue in and of itself. If we want to
meaningfully deal with the so-called
drug problem, we must look at why
people are choosing the bag over
the book. In the meantime, let's rid
ourselves of the weight the drug
war has put on our country.

drug supply chains would evapo
rate: legal drug manufacturers
would have more affordable prod
ucts, given that they do not have to
worry about smuggling costs.
Decriminalizing drugs would re
duce the costs of incarcerating crim-

inals significantly and eliminate a
main criminal vocation in some of
the most sensitive parts of our coun
try. Children who might otherwise
have become drug dealers would
have fewer options outside of going
to school and getting regular; legal
jobs. The main cause for strife in
high-risk neighborhoods would
eventually dissipate, drastically re
ducing the incidence of gang-related
murder and violent crime. The risk
of drugs containing tertiary sub
stances would also fall due to the
fact that competitive market forces
would set standards for quality and
transparency.
As for drug users, I believe that
the market would react by having
stricter drug tests for jobs and
schools. Although drug use would
not be punished by the government,
the social tradeoffs would most like
ly become much clearer than they
are now.
Life will not be that different:
Like alcohol, I imagine that drug
use on the job will not be tolerated.
Similarly, social security programs
such as the evaluation of the ability
of parents to rear children will con
tinue to take drug use into consider
ation. It's possible that drug de
pendency will force more people in
to an underclass of drug addicts
who are totally disconnected from
society, but this will be a social
tradeoff that will hopefully further
highlight an incentive to not actual
ly abuse drugs.
Legalizing drugs, however,
should be done through Congress
as opposed to executive decriminal
ization. Obama's current policy of
skirting the legislative process to
decriminalize marijuana sets a dan
gerous precedent for the abuse of
executive powers.
It is clear that the criminaliza
tion of drugs cannot stomp out the
market forces sustaining them. Giv
en that the market for drugs will
persist, we might as well eliminate
the multitude of consequences I
mentioned above by legalizing it.
Not all seemingly moral prob
lems have moral solutions. We must
think beyond our impulse to punish
the bad and find responses that will
work in practice. The prevalence of
drugs is a social symptom, not an is
sue in and of itself. If we want to
meaningfully deal with the so-called
drug problem, we must look at why
people are choosing the bag over
the book. In the meantime, let's rid
ourselves of the weight the drug
war has put on our country.

There is really no way to argue
that the country's current
drug policy is successful.
The war on drugs costs the U.S.
taxpayers $4O billion a year, yet the
United States is the still the largest
illegal drug consumer in the world
by far. As a percentage of our popu
lation, we lead the world in cocaine
use, eclipsing the next biggest, New
Zealand, by a factor of four. Drug of
fenses are the primary cause for
federal incarceration: 50 percent of
men and women in federal prison
are being held for drug-related
crimes.
Evidently, our approach to regu
lating drugs is not working in its
current form, and we need to devise
a new strategy.
Legalizing drugs would be a
great first step. Punishing victim
less crimes is a violation of basic
freedoms of choice. According to
many people, under certain sets of
situations this trade-off—law and
order in exchange for personal lib
erty— makes sense. With regards
to drugs, however, I believe that by
legislating substance use and distri
bution, we are merely conceding

control to the black market. Instead
of being channeled through indus
tries that can be monitored by the
people, drug distribution falls upon
those disenchanted with traditional
methods of social mobility.
As the penalty for selling and
distributing drugs increases, so
does the market incentive the
salary of the increasingly scarce and
increasingly valuable drug dealers.
The growth of this incentive is usu
ally correlated to school dropout
rates in areas with a lot of drug traf
ficking— unfortunately racial mi
norities bear the brunt of this effect.
Sociologist Sudhir Venkatesh
documents the social effects of the
prevalence of the illegal drug trade
in Chicago in his book "Gang
Leader for a Day." Venkatesh points
to the geographical fractionalization
and consequential gang wars that
stem from fighting over distribution
channels.
By keeping drugs in the black
market, we are essentially damning
entire subsections of society to live
in an extremely violent and drug
laden environment. Fifty percent of
street crimes in Chicago are caused
by gangs fighting over drug distri
bution.
Even on an international level,
consider who is supplying the black
market with these drugs. Heroin
mainly flows out of rural
Afghanistan where its revenues are
shared between farmers and the
Taliban. Marijuana and cocaine
from Central and South America
are responsible for the deep corrup
tion and crime problems that afflict
countries like Mexico. As American
drug policy currently stands, it is a
lose-lose situation. Everyone is in a
bad place.
Let's legalize all drugs. People
who disagree with this theory often
think that I am supporting the de
struction of society. I would argue
that if we were to legalize drugs, we
would have less problems stemming
from drug use. First and foremost,
it has become clear that drug use is
an undeniable social reality, and that
it is impossible to banish completely
unless we employ draconian, free
dom-suppressing laws like those in
Singapore.
Given this reality, let us honestly
weigh what could happen if we were
to legalize drug distribution and use.
Most clearly, the formerly illegal
