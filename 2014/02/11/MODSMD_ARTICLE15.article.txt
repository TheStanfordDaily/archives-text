## Women's soccer signs nation's top recruit class 
### â€“ Fiona Noonan 
The Stanford women's
soccer team announced today
that it had signed seven new
players from the class of 2018
to make up what Top Drawe
r is calling the na
tion's No. 1 recruiting class.
The Cardinal will return
nine of its 11 starters next
season, and hopes will be
high for the team after its un
characteristically early de
parture from the NCAA
Championship tournament
this past fall.
The rising freshman class
consists of five Californians,
as well as one player from
Washington and one from
Virginia, adding to an al
ready California-heavy
squad.
The top recruit, Andi Sul
livan of Lorton, Va., will be a
familiar face for some of the
Cardinal already; she is the
captain of the U-20 Women's
National Team, and has
played alongside freshmen
Maddie Bauer, Jane Camp
bell and Stephanie Amack,
along with sophomore Laura
Leidle.
"Andi... brings a wealth of
experience to Stanford,"
head coach Paul Ratcliffe told
GoStanford.com. "Andi will
be a great leader and has the
potential to make an immedi
ate impact as a defender or
midfielder."
Sullivan, who will further
contribute to a back line al
ready held steady by Bauer,
Liedle and redshirt junior
Kendall Romine, is not the
only major talent coming to
the team.
Kyra Carusa of San Diego
and Mariah Lee of Coving
ton, Wash, will help to fill the
gap left by departing red
shirt senior Courtney Verloo,
the Cardinal's scoring leader
this past season.
At midfield, Stanford will
add Zoe Pacalin of Portola Val
ley, Calif., Jaye Boissiere of

Los Altos Hills, Calif, and
Sarah Robinson of Los Altos,
Calif., while Alison Jahansouz
of Huntington Beach, Calif,
will become the backup goal
keeper to freshman Jane
Campbell, who was productive
at the position after replacing
injured senior Emily Oliver
early in the 2013 season.
The addition of so much lo
cal talent is another benefit of
this recruiting class; Pacalin,
Robinson and Boissiere all
played together on the Moun-

tain View-Los Altos Light
ning club team and will thus
bring pre-existing chemistry
onto the field at Stanford.
"We are very excited to
sign seven outstanding stu
dent-athletes for our 2014 re
cruiting class," Ratcliffe told
GoStanford.com. "We are
confident that they will be
valuable contributors to the
team and help us compete for
another national champi
onship."
