# STUDENT LIFE
## Art In Your Dorm showcases student-created artwork 
### IRENE HSU DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Arts Institute will host an
Art In Your Dorm program for the entire
campus in March 2014, allowing students to
showcase their artwork and participate in
workshops as part of the University's
growing efforts to support the arts.
The Art in Your Dorm initiative, which
piloted successfully during New Student
Orientation, was inspired by FloMoMa, a
Florence Moore Hall (FloMo)-based arts
appreciation event that occurs at the end of

winter quarter. Paula Salazar 'l3, a former
Cardenal resident assistant and a current
Arts in Student Life coordinator for the
Stanford Arts Institute, had expanded the
annual FloMoMa from a weekend-long
gallery exposition of residential artwork to
a weeklong program celebrating the arts, a
model that the pilot followed.
Salazar attributed the pilot's success to
how accessible programming was for stu
dents.
"It was extremely localized and casual,"

In an effort to increase the presence of arts on campus, the Stanford Arts Institute will
host a month-long dorm-based initiative that encourages students to engage with art.
