# STUDENT LIFE
## Art In Your Dorm showcases student-created artwork 
### IRENE HSU DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Arts Institute will host an
Art In Your Dorm program for the entire
campus in March 2014, allowing students to
showcase their artwork and participate in
workshops as part of the University's
growing efforts to support the arts.
The Art in Your Dorm initiative, which
piloted successfully during New Student
Orientation, was inspired by FloMoMa, a
Florence Moore Hall (FloMo)-based arts
appreciation event that occurs at the end of

winter quarter. Paula Salazar 'l3, a former
Cardenal resident assistant and a current
Arts in Student Life coordinator for the
Stanford Arts Institute, had expanded the
annual FloMoMa from a weekend-long
gallery exposition of residential artwork to
a weeklong program celebrating the arts, a
model that the pilot followed.
Salazar attributed the pilot's success to
how accessible programming was for stu
dents.
"It was extremely localized and casual,"

In an effort to increase the presence of arts on campus, the Stanford Arts Institute will
host a month-long dorm-based initiative that encourages students to engage with art.
Salazar said. "There are al
ways people who wouldn't
normally self-elect into art
events, but if it is local,
they're more likely to drop
by and participate."
During NSO, 13 houses in
seven residence halls partici
pated in the event. An esti
mated total of 450 students
were involved in the event,
according to Salazar. The
Arts Institute is still contact
ing dorms and residential
fellows to finalize locations
for Art In Your Dorm for the
future.

Other initiatives
The Art in Your Dorm ini
tiative is only one of several
programs recently intro
duced by the University in
an effort to increase partici
pation in and awareness of
the arts. Other projects in
clude the residential Immer
sion in the Arts: Living in
Culture (ITALIC) program
and Stanford's Summer In

ternships Program in Arts
Administration, which was
created in 2009 and which
has since grown to feature 15
different internships.
Alex Fialho 'll, who land
ed his first job in New York
City through the Summer
Internships Program in Arts
Administration at Gagosian
Gallery, said the program
was a "good entry point" in
to the art world.
Although Fialho de
scribed the University as
very supportive while he was
at Stanford, he furthered his
career in the arts principally
by working outside of school,
including interning at the
San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art during his jun
ior year.
Salazar framed Fialho's
experience as "phase one" of
Stanford's efforts to pro
mote the arts on campus, in
which the University pro
vides funding for students
and shows a commitment to
the arts.
Salazar said that she is
currently implementing
"phase two," which she de
scribed as the University
proactively encouraging stu

dents to become more in
volved in the arts.
"We've built programs
now, and we can make them
stronger by reaching out to
students more," Salazar
said.
Salazar acknowledged
that students may be hesi
tant about seeking opportu
nities in the arts because
they feel they are too inexpe
rienced, a concern she has
observed through speaking
with students.
"It seems an all-or-noth
ing mentality with students
here, and it's just not true,"
Salazar said. "The Arts In
stitute hosts programs like
Art In Your Dorm to show
students that art can be as
big or as little of a part in
their lives, but can still add

meaning to their experiences
as Stanford students."
Other programs that
Salazar has initiated this
year to promote this idea in
clude Your Art Here, which
showcases student art
around campus and hosts
workshops for the student
cohorts. She has also worked
on marketing for the Art In
stitute and with other art or
ganizations on campus to
promote awareness about
the arts.
"You don't need to be an
expert to be involved in the
arts," Salazar said. "Creative
expression can be a great re
lease, and it's fine if that's all
art is to you."
