# Jeopardy contestants reflect on experience
## Stanford boasts two Jeopardy winners 
### NITISH KULKARNI DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
While Jeopardy may be
one of America's favorite tele
vision game shows, the quiz
competition also has a special
relationship with the Univer
sity. Stanford students have
participated extensively in the
trivia game show's various
forms over time and even,
on more than one occasion,
emerged victorious.
Vinita Kailasanath 'O4 M.S.
'O4 J.D. 'lO was the first Stan
ford undergraduate in recent
memory to win College Jeop
ardy, trumping the competi
tion by a significant margin to
win the show in 2001 as a
sophomore. Nico Martinez 'O7
JD 'l3 won the show in fall
2005, winning $lOO,OOO.
"Stanford is the only school
to have more than one college
winner," Kailasanath noted.
Kailasanath will return to
Jeopardy on April 3 this year
as a competitor in the "Tour
nament of the Decades,"
which brings back contestants
from previous decades.

A challenging path
Despite the many forms
and variations of Jeopardy,
the path of entry into the
game for everyone— from
high school students to adults
remains the same, accord
ing to Matt Olson 'l4, who
played College Jeopardy in
fall 2012 and won $lO,OOO as a
semifinalist.
"The process was an online
test, in October, [and] if you

get a high enough score, they
invite you to do an in-person
audition in L.A," he recalled.
The audition includes a
written test, a short mock
game and some interview
questions. Olson said that
while the time between taking
the online test and the audi
tion was lengthy, the process
went quickly after the in-per
son interview took place.
"They did all the prelims
on the first day, and then they
had the semifinals and finals
on the second day," he said. "It
was only a 48-hour period, and
they then aired them the first
two weeks of February."
In addition to hosting a
number of College Jeopardy
stars, Stanford also boasts nu
merous students who partici
pated in Teen Jeopardy dur
ing their high school years.
Nikhil Desai 'l6 is one of
them, having competed in
Teen Jeopardy in 2010.
"It was quite surprising
when I heard [I was on the
show]," Desai said. "Jeopardy

usually sends someone over to
your school to surprise you
with the announcement and a
camera, but for me that didn't
happen, so my parents were
the ones that spoiled it for me
instead. I was really excited
and thrilled, and then I really
got nervous."
Olivia Hummer 'l7 partici
pated in Teen Jeopardy as a
high school sophomore. She
explained that, for Teen Jeop
ardy, the auditions happen at
several different places across
the country, and that "they
film multiple episodes per
day."
In order to make it appear
that episodes are filmed on
different days, host Alex Tre
bek changes his suit between
each episode's filming.
The Stanford community
of Jeopardy players is surpris
ing in its scope, according to
former participants.

'l7] is a freshman here too,"
Hummer noted, adding that
the two had met again at an
admitted student receptions
in the Los Angeles area.
The experience
While impressions of Tre
bek's on-camera demeanor
may be mixed, Stanford's
Jeopardy contestants of
fered a different picture of
his overall character.
"Alex Trebek is actually
really nice," Hummer said.
"Every contestant gets to
take a photo with him and
talk to him then. He guessed
my shoe size, which is kind of
strange. He's a personable
guy."
"Alex Trebek is really in
teresting— he's really pro
fessional," Desai concurred.
"I don't think he likes high
schoolers that much, though.
I think he preferred the par
ents' company to the teenage
competitors. I felt it, I think
a couple of my other fellow
competitors felt it [as well]."
Contestants also drew at
tention to the support they
had received from the Uni

versity community.
"A bunch of my friends
drove down from Stanford so
we had a bunch of people in
Stanford Cardinal sweat
shirts," Kailasanath said,
adding that faculty were also
supportive even when
she had to miss a week of
class to film the show at
UCLA. "I think people from
Stanford tend to do particu
larly well because the cul
ture of Stanford is one that
really encourages intellectu
al curiosity."
Strategic considerations
"The most important
thing about jeopardy is tim
ing the buzzer," Olson em
phasized, noting that at least
two contestants likely know
the answer to each ques
tion. "Buzzing in right
when the lights go on to un
lock the buzzers is how you
win basically."
"What you don't see
when you're watching at
home is that the row of lights
that come on the sides of the
game board," Kailasanath
added, referencing the lights
that indicate to contestants
that the question time has
expired. "If you buzz in be
fore those lights go on, you
are given a quarter-second
delay put on your buzzer

where you can't buzz in. That
quarter second doesn't
sound like a lot, but it is a
lot."
Of the Stanford contin
gent, only Martinez and
Kailasanath have been
champions in any form of
Jeopardy. Others, however,
have had equally dramatic
experiences.
"I went in winning, and
then dropped at final jeop
ardy," Hummer recalled. "I
still think that the [way the]
last question on final jeop
ardy [turned out] was silly.
The question was that the
Ancient Greeks believed
that the planet that moved
the slowest was 'blank,' or
something along those lines.
The kid who won it, I expect
ed him to bet more, so I bet
higher to top him, but in the
end I got it wrong, and he
had bet less than I had antic
ipated."
"I was really upset," Ol
son reflected with regards to
his semifinal loss. "One of
the major things I learned
from being there was how
much it can go either way. I
was leading going in to final
jeopardy, and everyone got
final jeopardy wrong. The
way that the wagers worked
out, though, I wound up with
less than the person who was

previously second-placed."
Olson emphasized the
value of betting strategies,
tailored to opponents and
the stage of the game.
"I had a Daily Double
near the end of my second
game, and I was trying to
wager enough that I would
be more than twice the sec
ond person, so final jeopardy
didn't matter," he recalled.
"There's a lot more strategy
involved in the final jeopardy
wagering... One useful thing
to know is that you should at
least read up on final jeop
ardy wagering. That's some
thing you can learn, and it
could be useful."
In fact, the third-placed
contestant in Olson's semifi
nal would have won had he
not wagered at all.
"In terms of board-play
strategies, I try to move
around the board,"
Kailasanath said. "I try to go
for the Daily Doubles at
times that I think are strate
gic. I don't play categories
from top to bottom usually."
Other contestants put
less emphasis, however, on
betting strategies and more
on general preparation. De
sai said that he had practiced
by using a Jeopardy video
game he had at home, and by
watching the TV show.
"You don't get any mate
rials to prepare for jeop
ardy," Kailasanath lamented.
Either way, it seems that
whether through strate
gy, preparation or simple
smarts Stanford students
have done just fine on Amer
ica's favorite game show.

Of the Stanford contin
gent, only Martinez and
Kailasanath have been
champions in any form of
Jeopardy. Others, however,
have had equally dramatic
experiences.
"I went in winning, and
then dropped at final jeop
ardy," Hummer recalled. "I
still think that the [way the]
last question on final jeop
ardy [turned out] was silly.
The question was that the
Ancient Greeks believed
that the planet that moved
the slowest was 'blank,' or
something along those lines.
The kid who won it, I expect
ed him to bet more, so I bet
higher to top him, but in the
end I got it wrong, and he
had bet less than I had antic
ipated."
"I was really upset," Ol
son reflected with regards to
his semifinal loss. "One of
the major things I learned
from being there was how
much it can go either way. I
was leading going in to final
jeopardy, and everyone got
final jeopardy wrong. The
way that the wagers worked
out, though, I wound up with
less than the person who was

previously second-placed."
Olson emphasized the
value of betting strategies,
tailored to opponents and
the stage of the game.
"I had a Daily Double
near the end of my second
game, and I was trying to
wager enough that I would
be more than twice the sec
ond person, so final jeopardy
didn't matter," he recalled.
"There's a lot more strategy
involved in the final jeopardy
wagering... One useful thing
to know is that you should at
least read up on final jeop
ardy wagering. That's some
thing you can learn, and it
could be useful."
In fact, the third-placed
contestant in Olson's semifi
nal would have won had he
not wagered at all.
"In terms of board-play
strategies, I try to move
around the board,"
Kailasanath said. "I try to go
for the Daily Doubles at
times that I think are strate
gic. I don't play categories
from top to bottom usually."
Other contestants put
less emphasis, however, on
betting strategies and more
on general preparation. De

by using a Jeopardy video
game he had at home, and by
watching the TV show.
"You don't get any mate

Either way, it seems that

While Jeopardy may be
one of America's favorite tele
vision game shows, the quiz
competition also has a special
relationship with the Univer
sity. Stanford students have
participated extensively in the
trivia game show's various
forms over time and even,
on more than one occasion,
emerged victorious.
Vinita Kailasanath 'O4 M.S.
'O4 J.D. 'lO was the first Stan
ford undergraduate in recent
memory to win College Jeop
ardy, trumping the competi
tion by a significant margin to
win the show in 2001 as a
sophomore. Nico Martinez 'O7
JD 'l3 won the show in fall
2005, winning $lOO,OOO.
"Stanford is the only school
to have more than one college
winner," Kailasanath noted.
Kailasanath will return to
Jeopardy on April 3 this year
as a competitor in the "Tour
nament of the Decades,"
which brings back contestants
from previous decades.

A challenging path
Despite the many forms
and variations of Jeopardy,
the path of entry into the
game for everyone— from
high school students to adults
remains the same, accord
ing to Matt Olson 'l4, who
played College Jeopardy in
fall 2012 and won $lO,OOO as a
semifinalist.
"The process was an online
test, in October, [and] if you

get a high enough score, they
invite you to do an in-person
audition in L.A," he recalled.
The audition includes a
written test, a short mock
game and some interview
questions. Olson said that
while the time between taking
the online test and the audi
tion was lengthy, the process
went quickly after the in-per
son interview took place.
"They did all the prelims
on the first day, and then they
had the semifinals and finals
on the second day," he said. "It
was only a 48-hour period, and
they then aired them the first
two weeks of February."
In addition to hosting a
number of College Jeopardy
stars, Stanford also boasts nu
merous students who partici
pated in Teen Jeopardy dur
ing their high school years.
Nikhil Desai 'l6 is one of
them, having competed in
Teen Jeopardy in 2010.
"It was quite surprising
when I heard [I was on the
show]," Desai said. "Jeopardy

usually sends someone over to
your school to surprise you
with the announcement and a
camera, but for me that didn't
happen, so my parents were
the ones that spoiled it for me
instead. I was really excited
and thrilled, and then I really
got nervous."
Olivia Hummer 'l7 partici
pated in Teen Jeopardy as a
high school sophomore. She
explained that, for Teen Jeop
ardy, the auditions happen at
several different places across
the country, and that "they
film multiple episodes per
day."
In order to make it appear
that episodes are filmed on
different days, host Alex Tre
bek changes his suit between
each episode's filming.
The Stanford community
of Jeopardy players is surpris
ing in its scope, according to
former participants.

Hummer noted, adding that
the two had met again at an
admitted student receptions
in the Los Angeles area.
The experience
While impressions of Tre
bek's on-camera demeanor
may be mixed, Stanford's
Jeopardy contestants of
fered a different picture of
his overall character.
"Alex Trebek is actually
really nice," Hummer said.
"Every contestant gets to
take a photo with him and
talk to him then. He guessed
my shoe size, which is kind of
strange. He's a personable
guy."
"Alex Trebek is really in
teresting— he's really pro
fessional," Desai concurred.
"I don't think he likes high
schoolers that much, though.
I think he preferred the par
ents' company to the teenage
competitors. I felt it, I think
a couple of my other fellow
competitors felt it [as well]."
Contestants also drew at
tention to the support they
had received from the Uni

versity community.
"A bunch of my friends
drove down from Stanford so
we had a bunch of people in
Stanford Cardinal sweat
shirts," Kailasanath said,
adding that faculty were also
supportive even when
she had to miss a week of
class to film the show at
UCLA. "I think people from
Stanford tend to do particu
larly well because the cul
ture of Stanford is one that
really encourages intellectu
al curiosity."
Strategic considerations
"The most important
thing about jeopardy is tim
ing the buzzer," Olson em
phasized, noting that at least
two contestants likely know
the answer to each ques
tion. "Buzzing in right
when the lights go on to un
lock the buzzers is how you
win basically."
"What you don't see
when you're watching at
home is that the row of lights
that come on the sides of the
game board," Kailasanath
added, referencing the lights
that indicate to contestants
that the question time has
expired. "If you buzz in be
fore those lights go on, you
are given a quarter-second
delay put on your buzzer

where you can't buzz in. That

explained that, for Teen Jeop
ardy, the auditions happen at
several different places across
the country, and that "they
film multiple episodes per
day."
In order to make it appear
that episodes are filmed on
different days, host Alex Tre
bek changes his suit between
each episode's filming.
The Stanford community
of Jeopardy players is surpris
ing in its scope, according to
former participants.

'l7] is a freshman here too,"
Hummer noted, adding that
the two had met again at an
admitted student receptions
in the Los Angeles area.
The experience
While impressions of Tre
bek's on-camera demeanor
may be mixed, Stanford's
Jeopardy contestants of
fered a different picture of
his overall character.
"Alex Trebek is actually
really nice," Hummer said.
"Every contestant gets to
take a photo with him and
talk to him then. He guessed
my shoe size, which is kind of
strange. He's a personable
guy."
"Alex Trebek is really in
teresting— he's really pro
fessional," Desai concurred.
"I don't think he likes high
schoolers that much, though.
I think he preferred the par
ents' company to the teenage
competitors. I felt it, I think
a couple of my other fellow
competitors felt it [as well]."
Contestants also drew at
tention to the support they
had received from the Uni

versity community.
"A bunch of my friends
drove down from Stanford so
we had a bunch of people in
Stanford Cardinal sweat
shirts," Kailasanath said,
adding that faculty were also
supportive even when
she had to miss a week of
class to film the show at
UCLA. "I think people from
Stanford tend to do particu
larly well because the cul
ture of Stanford is one that
really encourages intellectu
al curiosity."
Strategic considerations
"The most important
thing about jeopardy is tim
ing the buzzer," Olson em
phasized, noting that at least
two contestants likely know
the answer to each ques
tion. "Buzzing in right
when the lights go on to un
lock the buzzers is how you
win basically."
"What you don't see
when you're watching at
home is that the row of lights
that come on the sides of the
game board," Kailasanath
added, referencing the lights
that indicate to contestants
that the question time has
expired. "If you buzz in be
fore those lights go on, you
are given a quarter-second
delay put on your buzzer

where you can't buzz in. That
quarter second doesn't
sound like a lot, but it is a
lot."
Of the Stanford contin
gent, only Martinez and
Kailasanath have been
champions in any form of
Jeopardy. Others, however,
have had equally dramatic
experiences.
"I went in winning, and
then dropped at final jeop
ardy," Hummer recalled. "I
still think that the [way the]
last question on final jeop
ardy [turned out] was silly.
The question was that the
Ancient Greeks believed
that the planet that moved
the slowest was 'blank,' or
something along those lines.
The kid who won it, I expect
ed him to bet more, so I bet
higher to top him, but in the
end I got it wrong, and he
had bet less than I had antic
ipated."
"I was really upset," Ol
son reflected with regards to
his semifinal loss. "One of
the major things I learned
from being there was how
much it can go either way. I
was leading going in to final
jeopardy, and everyone got
final jeopardy wrong. The
way that the wagers worked
out, though, I wound up with
less than the person who was

previously second-placed."
Olson emphasized the
value of betting strategies,
tailored to opponents and
the stage of the game.
"I had a Daily Double
near the end of my second
game, and I was trying to
wager enough that I would
be more than twice the sec
ond person, so final jeopardy
didn't matter," he recalled.
"There's a lot more strategy
involved in the final jeopardy
wagering... One useful thing
to know is that you should at
least read up on final jeop
ardy wagering. That's some
thing you can learn, and it
could be useful."
In fact, the third-placed
contestant in Olson's semifi
nal would have won had he
not wagered at all.
"In terms of board-play
strategies, I try to move
around the board,"
Kailasanath said. "I try to go
for the Daily Doubles at
times that I think are strate
gic. I don't play categories
from top to bottom usually."
Other contestants put
less emphasis, however, on
betting strategies and more
on general preparation. De
sai said that he had practiced
by using a Jeopardy video
game he had at home, and by
watching the TV show.
"You don't get any mate
rials to prepare for jeop
ardy," Kailasanath lamented.
Either way, it seems that
whether through strate
gy, preparation or simple
smarts Stanford students
have done just fine on Amer
ica's favorite game show.
