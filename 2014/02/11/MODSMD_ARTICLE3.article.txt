# Jeopardy contestants reflect on experience
## Stanford boasts two Jeopardy winners 
### NITISH KULKARNI DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
While Jeopardy may be
one of America's favorite tele
vision game shows, the quiz
competition also has a special
relationship with the Univer
sity. Stanford students have
participated extensively in the
trivia game show's various
forms over time and even,
on more than one occasion,
emerged victorious.
Vinita Kailasanath 'O4 M.S.
'O4 J.D. 'lO was the first Stan
ford undergraduate in recent
memory to win College Jeop
ardy, trumping the competi
tion by a significant margin to
win the show in 2001 as a
sophomore. Nico Martinez 'O7
JD 'l3 won the show in fall
2005, winning $lOO,OOO.
"Stanford is the only school
to have more than one college
winner," Kailasanath noted.
Kailasanath will return to
Jeopardy on April 3 this year
as a competitor in the "Tour
nament of the Decades,"
which brings back contestants
from previous decades.

A challenging path
Despite the many forms
and variations of Jeopardy,
the path of entry into the
game for everyoneâ€” from
high school students to adults
remains the same, accord
ing to Matt Olson 'l4, who
played College Jeopardy in
fall 2012 and won $lO,OOO as a
semifinalist.
"The process was an online
test, in October, [and] if you

get a high enough score, they
invite you to do an in-person
audition in L.A," he recalled.
The audition includes a
written test, a short mock
game and some interview
questions. Olson said that
while the time between taking
the online test and the audi
tion was lengthy, the process
went quickly after the in-per
son interview took place.
"They did all the prelims
on the first day, and then they
had the semifinals and finals
on the second day," he said. "It
was only a 48-hour period, and
they then aired them the first
two weeks of February."
In addition to hosting a
number of College Jeopardy
stars, Stanford also boasts nu
merous students who partici
pated in Teen Jeopardy dur
ing their high school years.
Nikhil Desai 'l6 is one of
them, having competed in
Teen Jeopardy in 2010.
"It was quite surprising
when I heard [I was on the
show]," Desai said. "Jeopardy

usually sends someone over to
your school to surprise you
with the announcement and a
camera, but for me that didn't
happen, so my parents were
the ones that spoiled it for me
instead. I was really excited
and thrilled, and then I really
got nervous."
Olivia Hummer 'l7 partici
pated in Teen Jeopardy as a
high school sophomore. She
explained that, for Teen Jeop
ardy, the auditions happen at
several different places across
the country, and that "they
film multiple episodes per
day."
In order to make it appear
that episodes are filmed on
different days, host Alex Tre
bek changes his suit between
each episode's filming.
The Stanford community
of Jeopardy players is surpris
ing in its scope, according to
former participants.
