# STUDENT LIFE
## Pixar filmmakers discuss animation 
### TIFFANY LAM 
The Stanford Design Initia
tive (SDI), along with the San
Francisco chapter of Women in
Animation, co-hosted a panel
event in Annenberg Auditorium
entitled "Scare School 101" on
Monday night, during which the
filmmaking team of Pixar Anima
tion Studios guided over 200 at
tendees through the production
process of their movie "Monsters
University."
Panelists included supervising
technical director Sanjay Bakshi;
technical lighting lead Steven
James; lighting technical director
Scott Clifford; and animator Alli
son Rutland.
The event was completely
funded by the ASSU. The alloca
tion of 200 free tickets sold out

within two hours of their email re
lease.
Bakshi began the talk with a
discussion of the major technical
challenges encountered during
the making of "Monsters Univer
sity", including incorporating
more characters than ever before
and the simulation of furry mon
sters wearing clothes, as well as
lighting and rendering. His pres
entation included story reels from
the film and took attendees
through the process of creating
character designs.
Rutland followed with a pres
entation on the animation
process.
"We take reality and abstract
it to tell a story," he said, using
the character Sulley to give an ex
ample of the animation process.
Her talk focused on how anima

tors showcased Sulley's personal
ity and thoughts through the ani
mation of realistic physicality and
actions.
James and Clifford concluded
the talk by focusing on the film's
complex lighting processes.
James discussed the Global Illu

mination Project, an endeavor de
signed to add more realistic light
ing in three-dimensional anima
tion through global illumination
(GI) or physically-based render
ing techniques.
James showed scenes from
the movie with and without global
illumination to highlight the dif
ference created by the technique.
Clifford, meanwhile, focused on
the urchin lighting setup of a par
ticular scene in the film's Scare
Games sequence, drawing in the
technological aspects of develop
ing 3,679 points of light.
"It's just a for-loop that runs a
thousand times," he remarked
about the setup.
The panel ended with a brief
Q&A session to address questions
that had been pre-submitted by
attendees and then approved by
SDI. During this period, the film
making team discussed their
backgrounds in animation, ex
panded further on animation
processes and challenges faced
during the making of the film and
gave advice to budding designers.
"Animation is so subjective, so

show other people your work
and get feedback," Rutland
emphasized, encouraging
students to find a mentor.
"Be interesting," Clifford
said. "You need something to
stand out."
Overall, student reac
tions to the event were ex
tremely positive.
During the event, Katie
Kirsch 'l6 enthusiastically
thanked the panelists for the

extremely interesting talk.
Afterwards, Su Lin Yeo 'l5
reflected on what she
learned.
"I didn't know how much
work went into the anima
tion process I always
thought animation was just
the creative process of devel
oping the storyline," she
said. "It was really interest
ing to learn that the people
who can code and animate
did a lot of the hard work.
It's a much more strategic
and analytical process than I
expected."
SDl's main objective for
the event was to build a com

munity of creative thinkers,
according to SDI co-presi
dent Sheta Chatterjee 'l4,
who believed that the panel
was beneficial to the Stan
ford community.
"A lot of people on cam
pus want to get involved in
design-related things, and
animation covers many as
pects of the creative
process," Chatterjee said,
adding that the success of
the panel validated SDl's
plans to host similar events
and workshops in the future.
