## Sports teams prepare for Date Auction Annual student-athlete event, aims to raise money for Camp Kesem 
### MICHAELA ELIAS 
Outside of the student-athlete commu
nity, Feb. 17 might seem like a normal
Monday. For many athletic teams, howev
er, that day is no regular sporting event
but rather the culmination of intense an
ticipation and preparation the Athlete
Date Auction.
Cardinal Council, the student-athlete
representative body, organizes the Athlete
Date Auction every year. During the
event, different teams perform a dance
and audience members bid to go on what
ever "date" that team offers based on
their performance.
Funds raised have traditionally gone to
Camp Kesem, a weeklong summer camp
for children whose parents currently have
or have passed away due to cancer.
In past years, the auction has brought
in up to $4,000. The goal this year is to
raise over $5,000, according to women's
swim team member Katie Olsen'ls, a so
cial chair for the Cardinal Council and one
of the main organizers of the auction.
In the past, Camp Kesem has not tak
en an active part in the event. This year's
programming, however, will feature a
speech by a Camp Kesem representative
in an effort to generate more enthusiasm
for the auction.
"We are trying to make charity the
main attraction of the event this year and
raise more money for the camp," Olsen
said.
While the event is ostensibly for chari
ty, the main attraction has historically
been the dances themselves.
In fact, Bridget Boushka 'l7,
a member of the women's
swim team, said that one of
the things that she had
looked forward to as a re
cruit was the date auction.
"For swim team it's a
pretty big deal. We take it
pretty seriously," Boushka
said. "We need to keep up
our reputation."
Freshmen student-ath
letes typically choreograph
the dance. In fact, on most
teams, the dance is a sur
prise for the upperclassmen,
adding another layer of
pressure for the freshmen.
"In the past we've had a
history of really good per
formances so there's tons of
pressure to make it good,"
said Max Williamson 'l7, a
member of the men's swim
team. "We're all really excit
ed about it. Our freshman
class is really outgoing so it
will be fun to go onstage and
do something a little crazy."

"The freshman on the
volleyball team have been
preparing for a while and it
should be pretty entertain
ing," said Eric Mochalski
'l5, a member of the men's
volleyball team.
This year, different
teams have been able to cre
ate their own date packages
for the winning bidders.
Some of the packages in
clude a Disney princess
movie marathon with the
men's fencing team, frozen
yogurt with the women's
synchronized sailing team, a
sunset cruise with the fresh
man sailing team and
brunch with the field hockey
team.
Jenny Claypool, the Car
dinal Council liaison from
the Athletics Department,
noted that the Date Auction
is an opportunity to see the
student athletes in a differ
ent light.
"It's fun to see their per
sonalities showing through
in their performances and
it's a great way to support a
good cause," Claypool said.
