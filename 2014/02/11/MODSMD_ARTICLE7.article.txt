## The
						magic of the Olympic Games 
### Ashley Westhem 
I love the Olympics more than
any other recurring event in
my life. So basically, my fa
vorite part of 2014 is right
now; this is my Christmas,
birthday and summer vacation hap
piness all wrapped into one.
When I hear the Olympic anthem,
it makes me almost want to cry be
cause of the pride I feel for my coun
try, the respect I have for the athletes
and the positive memories I have as
sociated with watching the games
with my family. My family is not a
soccer family that's why I cover
basketball and not soccer but I
distinctly remember all of us sitting
together and cheering on Hope Solo,
Abby Wambach and Alex Morgan in
the United States' overtime win over
Brazil. There's just something about
the Games that brings people togeth
er and displays the true values and
passion of sports.
I'm also a huge sports fan in gen
eral, so watching athletes perform on
the biggest stage that exists for their
sports is truly special and some
thing that's even more momentous
because the Games only come
around every two-and-a-half years.
My goal is to be a commentator or
analyst for NBC at the Olympics. If
you make it to the Olympics, you've
made it as an athlete... so doesn't
that mean that if you're a sports
writer or broadcaster for the
Olympics, then you've made it in that
profession? I think so, at least. So that
would be a dream come true, espe
cially since I grew up surrounded by
past, present and future Olympians.
I grew up in Lake Tahoe and liked
to ski at Squaw Valley, where three
members of the U.S. Olympic Ski
Team and one snowboarder come
from. Julia Mancuso (who just won a
bronze medal in the super combined
downhill), Marco Sullivan, Travis
Ganong and Nate Holland were
names that I grew up hearing; to
watch them compete this year has
been incredible.
I have a lot of Mends trying to
make it onto the U.S. Ski Team and
to the Olympics; a close family Mend
of mine is the coach of the Junior
Olympics team at Squaw Valley
While I'm honored when they ask me
if I want to ski at Squaw with them, I
politely decline because I don't feel
like skiing off a cliff and embarrass
ing myself.
I mean that figuratively, but if you
had asked me a couple of years ago, it
would've been literally as well. While
I am very skeptical now of the
Olympics being held in Sochi, for a
time I was convinced that I would be
at the 2014 Olympics in Russia sup
porting a certain someone.
Growing up, I had the hugest
crush on my best friend's older
brother, who trained at Squaw and
was trying to make it on to the
Olympic Alpine Ski Team. When he
told me about four years ago that
competing in the 2014 Winter
Olympics was his goal, I told him that
I would be there to cheer him on with
his sister.
His only response was, "It's in
Russia."
As if he assumed that I wouldn't
go to a corrupt and somewhat unsafe
country for him. For the record, I
definitely would have, and so I re
sponded, "Well, you have to go to
Russia at some point in your life."
That's why it's so weird that the
2014 Sochi Olympics are going on
right now, in the present; it was al
ways a very far-off thing that I felt
would never happen, but it's here,
and neither of us â€”my friend's
brother nor I is in Russia. He is on
the U.S. Ski Team but just barely
missed out on the Olympic team.
My best Mend still doesn't know
that I used to like her brother; she
thinks I'm a huge fan of skiing be
cause of her (she competes for one of
the top colleges for skiing in the na
tion). Nope, alpine skiing in the
Olympics holds a special place in my
heart because of her brother and my
fantasy of travelling to Russia to
cheer him on.
And I guess growing up in Lake
Tahoe doesn't hurt since Olympic
athletes from every shore surround
me. I'm always proud of my home
town when I hear Tahoe or Squaw or
Truckee tied to an Olympic athlete's
name. And that's what the Olympics
is all about: pride in community and
participation in something that can
unite so many types of people.

Unfortunately, Ashley Westhem's
romantic fantasy was crushed by
the inability ofKZSU and The Dai
ly to get her a press credential for
the Sochi Olympics. Tell her why
journalists can sometimes be the
worst at awesthem@stanford.edu
and Tweet at her @ashwest!6.
