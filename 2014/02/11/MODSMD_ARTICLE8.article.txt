# CARDINAL BASEBALL
## READY AND RELOADED Five key position players return for 2014 season 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Stanford baseball officially
kicks off its season this Friday at
Sunken Diamond with several
key returning players and talent
ed new freshmen, but also with
many major holes to fill.
"The 2014 Stanford baseball

team will be a little bit of a combi
nation of youth and experience,"
said head coach Mark Marquess
at Monday's Pac-12 Media Day
"We return five position players
who started or played most of the
year last year Wayne Taylor,
Brant Whiting, Austin Slater,
Alex Blandino and Danny
Diekroeger."

The Cardinal's infield will
largely be composed of returning
players. Junior third baseman
Alex Blandino returns and begins
the season as a Baseball America
preseason second-team Ail-
American. Blandino finished sec
ond on the team last season with
seven home runs and figures to
hit in the heart of the Cardinal's

order.
Senior Danny Diekroeger will
again start for the Cardinal, but
may switch from second base,
where he played for most of his 54
starts last season, to first base.
Brian Ragira previously manned
first for the Cardinal but left to
play professionally after being
drafted by the San Francisco Gi
ants in the fourth round of the
2013 MLB Draft. Ragira led the
team with eight home runs and 42
RBI last season and leaves a gap
in the three-hole in the Stanford
lineup.
"Right now, on Friday we'll
start Danny Diekroeger [at first
base]," Marquess said. "He's
played there before and he will do
a fine job there."
Sophomore Austin Barr will
back up Diekroeger at first base
and will start if Diekroeger ro
tates back to second base. Mar
quess spoke highly of Barr's hit
ting skills and mentioned that
Barr could also see time at desig
nated hitter.
Sophomore Drew Jackson
won the starting shortstop posi
tion after starting in 24 games
last season and hitting .207. His
double-play partner at second
base will likely be either fresh
man Tommy Edman or senior
Brett Michael Doran.
Junior Wayne Taylor, who
started 40 games last year for the
Card, will see time at catcher and
left field this season. His duties
behind the plate will be split with
senior Brant Whiting, who led the
team with a .344 average last year
while starting in 36 games. Both
players figure to play every day,

with Taylor alternating be
tween left field and catcher
and Whiting shifting be
tween catcher and designat
ed hitter.
The outfield for the Card
is still largely in flux. Junior
Austin Slater, who started 48
games last season, is the on
ly real certainty and will play
center field. Slater batted
second for much of last sea
son while hitting .269 with
32 RBI. Slater shifts over
from right field to replace
Austin Wilson, who was
drafted in the second round
of the 2013 MLB Draft by
the Seattle Mariners. Wil
son missed significant time
due to an injury last season
but still returned to hit .288
with five home runs and 26
RBI while batting in the
cleanup spot.
Junior Dominic Jose,
sophomore Zach Hoffpauir,
sophomore Jonny Locher,
freshman Jack Klein and
freshman Alex Dunlap will
compete for the remaining
one or two outfield spots, de
pending on whether Wayne
Taylor plays in the outfield
on any given day.
"There are some new
faces, so we will kind of fig
ure out what's going to hap
pen after four or five
games," Marquess said.
The biggest hole to fill
for the Cardinal surely
comes in the rotation with
the departure of Mark Ap
pel, who was drafted first
overall to the MLB by the
Houston Astros after four
years with the Cardinal. Ap
pel finished last season as
Stanford's ace with a 10-4
record and a 2.12 ERA in 14
starts. He broke Stanford's
all-time strikeout record
and ended his Cardinal ca
reer with 372 strikeouts to
go along with 28 wins. The
loss of his reliable presence
in countering opposing aces
on Friday nights will come
as a major blow to the Card.
"That's about 105 innings
and 10 wins we have to re
place ... [But] we have four
or five guys coming back

who have thrown significant
innings," said Marquess re
garding Appel's departure.
Junior John Hochstatter
figures to be one of the Car
dinal's main options for re
placing Appel as Stanford's
ace. Hochstatter went 3-3
with a 3.88 ERA in 13 starts
mostly on Saturdays
last year for the Cardinal as
the number-two option in
the rotation behind Appel.
While it's unclear whether
or not Hochstatter will claim
Appel's role as the ace, he
brings valuable collegiate
experience to a pitching
staff largely devoid of it.
"[Hochstatter is] a crafty
left-hander not a real
hard-thrower but he knows
how to pitch," Marquess
stated.
Sophomore Bobby Zaru
bin would likely have joined
the starting rotation after
an impressive freshman
year that saw him finish
with a 3-3 record and a 2.16
ERA in 15 appearances, in
cluding 10 starts, but will be
sidelined by a torn labrum.
Likewise, sophomore
left-hander Logan James re
turns after pitching in 17
games last season with a 3-3
record and a 4.56 ERA.
James can either start or
come out of the bullpen and
should compete to be a start
ing pitcher in either the Sun
day rotation spot or as a
starter for non-conference
weekday games.
Several freshman pitch
ers that are expected to con
tribute this season include
Cal Quantrill, Brett
Hanewich, Chris Viall and
Tyler Thorne. Quantrill
could factor into Stanford's
starting rotation as a poten
tial opening-day starter, as
he brings valuable experi
ence after having pitched for
18-U Team Canada for three
years, winning a silver medal
in 2012 at the 18-U World
Championship in Seoul.
While the presumptive
favorites in battling for spots
in the rotation are Hochstat
ter, Quantrill and James, the
rotation remains relatively
unclear. Hanewich, Viall,
Thorne and Schmidt could
potentially become starting
pitchers as well as sopho
mores Daniel Starwalt and

Marcus Brakeman, each of
whom recorded two starts
last season.
On the coaching staff,
Marquess begins his 38th
season at the helm for the
Cardinal. However, he will
be without longtime assis
tant Dean Stotz, who retired
after 37 years with the Car
dinal this past offseason.
Stotz was replaced on the
coaching staff by former
Cardinal first baseman Ryan
Garko 'O3.
The Pac-12 released the
results of the preseason Pac
-12 coaches' poll, which
placed the Cardinal sixth in
the conference behind Ore
gon State, Oregon, UCLA,
Arizona State and Arizona.
Stanford also begins the sea
son ranked at No. 25 in the
USA Today coaches' poll.
"It's no doubt of mine
that we're in the toughest
conference in the country,"
Marquess noted. "The last
two champions have come
out of the Pac-12 Conference
Arizona and UCLA."
Expectations for the Car
dinal are tempered by the
major loss of talent from last
season and the demanding
schedule that the team faces.
Stanford plays seven presea
son top-25 teams, including
No. 3 Oregon State, No. 7
Oregon, No. 8 Yanderbilt,
No. 10 UCLA, No. 15 Rice,
No. 18 Arizona State and
No. 22 Texas.
"That's a very difficult
schedule," Marquess said.
"We will surely find out
where our weaknesses may
be and where we are lacking
... It's a challenge."
While competing for a
Pac-12 title is always the
goal for the Cardinal, the
season will ultimately be a
success if the Cardinal is
able to make the postseason
tournament, which it failed
to do last year.
"You've just got to get in
the tournament," Marquess
said. "If you play well at the
right time, you can win it."
The first pitch of the sea
son for Stanford is scheduled
for 4:30 p.m. this Friday, Feb.
14, against Rice at Sunken
Diamond.

starts. He broke Stanford's
all-time strikeout record
and ended his Cardinal ca
reer with 372 strikeouts to
go along with 28 wins. The
loss of his reliable presence
in countering opposing aces
on Friday nights will come
as a major blow to the Card.
"That's about 105 innings
and 10 wins we have to re
place ... [But] we have four
or five guys coming back

who have thrown significant
innings," said Marquess re
garding Appel's departure.
Junior John Hochstatter
figures to be one of the Car
dinal's main options for re
placing Appel as Stanford's
ace. Hochstatter went 3-3
with a 3.88 ERA in 13 starts
mostly on Saturdays
last year for the Cardinal as
the number-two option in
the rotation behind Appel.
While it's unclear whether
or not Hochstatter will claim
Appel's role as the ace, he
brings valuable collegiate
experience to a pitching
staff largely devoid of it.
"[Hochstatter is] a crafty
left-hander not a real
hard-thrower but he knows
how to pitch," Marquess
stated.
Sophomore Bobby Zaru
bin would likely have joined
the starting rotation after
an impressive freshman
year that saw him finish
with a 3-3 record and a 2.16
ERA in 15 appearances, in
cluding 10 starts, but will be
sidelined by a torn labrum.
Likewise, sophomore
left-hander Logan James re
turns after pitching in 17
games last season with a 3-3
record and a 4.56 ERA.
James can either start or
come out of the bullpen and
should compete to be a start
ing pitcher in either the Sun
day rotation spot or as a
starter for non-conference
weekday games.
Several freshman pitch
ers that are expected to con
tribute this season include
Cal Quantrill, Brett
Hanewich, Chris Viall and
Tyler Thorne. Quantrill
could factor into Stanford's
starting rotation as a poten
tial opening-day starter, as
he brings valuable experi
ence after having pitched for
18-U Team Canada for three
years, winning a silver medal
in 2012 at the 18-U World
Championship in Seoul.
While the presumptive
favorites in battling for spots
in the rotation are Hochstat
ter, Quantrill and James, the
rotation remains relatively
unclear. Hanewich, Viall,
Thorne and Schmidt could
potentially become starting
pitchers as well as sopho
mores Daniel Starwalt and

Marcus Brakeman, each of
whom recorded two starts
last season.
On the coaching staff,
Marquess begins his 38th
season at the helm for the
Cardinal. However, he will
be without longtime assis
tant Dean Stotz, who retired
after 37 years with the Car
dinal this past offseason.
Stotz was replaced on the
coaching staff by former
Cardinal first baseman Ryan
Garko 'O3.
The Pac-12 released the
results of the preseason Pac
-12 coaches' poll, which
placed the Cardinal sixth in
the conference behind Ore
gon State, Oregon, UCLA,
Arizona State and Arizona.
Stanford also begins the sea
son ranked at No. 25 in the
USA Today coaches' poll.
"It's no doubt of mine
that we're in the toughest
conference in the country,"
Marquess noted. "The last
two champions have come
out of the Pac-12 Conference
Arizona and UCLA."
Expectations for the Car
dinal are tempered by the
major loss of talent from last
season and the demanding
schedule that the team faces.
Stanford plays seven presea
son top-25 teams, including
No. 3 Oregon State, No. 7
Oregon, No. 8 Yanderbilt,
No. 10 UCLA, No. 15 Rice,
No. 18 Arizona State and
No. 22 Texas.
"That's a very difficult
schedule," Marquess said.
"We will surely find out
where our weaknesses may
be and where we are lacking
... It's a challenge."
While competing for a
Pac-12 title is always the
goal for the Cardinal, the
season will ultimately be a
success if the Cardinal is
able to make the postseason
tournament, which it failed
to do last year.
"You've just got to get in
the tournament," Marquess
said. "If you play well at the
right time, you can win it."
The first pitch of the sea
son for Stanford is scheduled
for 4:30 p.m. this Friday, Feb.
14, against Rice at Sunken
Diamond.

Stanford baseball officially
kicks off its season this Friday at
Sunken Diamond with several
key returning players and talent
ed new freshmen, but also with
many major holes to fill.
"The 2014 Stanford baseball

team will be a little bit of a combi
nation of youth and experience,"
said head coach Mark Marquess
at Monday's Pac-12 Media Day
"We return five position players
who started or played most of the
year last year Wayne Taylor,
Brant Whiting, Austin Slater,
Alex Blandino and Danny
Diekroeger."

The Cardinal's infield will
largely be composed of returning
players. Junior third baseman
Alex Blandino returns and begins
the season as a Baseball America
preseason second-team Ail-
American. Blandino finished sec
ond on the team last season with
seven home runs and figures to
hit in the heart of the Cardinal's

order.
Senior Danny Diekroeger will
again start for the Cardinal, but
may switch from second base,
where he played for most of his 54
starts last season, to first base.
Brian Ragira previously manned
first for the Cardinal but left to
play professionally after being
drafted by the San Francisco Gi
ants in the fourth round of the
2013 MLB Draft. Ragira led the
team with eight home runs and 42
RBI last season and leaves a gap
in the three-hole in the Stanford
lineup.
"Right now, on Friday we'll
start Danny Diekroeger [at first
base]," Marquess said. "He's
played there before and he will do
a fine job there."
Sophomore Austin Barr will
back up Diekroeger at first base
and will start if Diekroeger ro
tates back to second base. Mar
quess spoke highly of Barr's hit
ting skills and mentioned that
Barr could also see time at desig
nated hitter.
Sophomore Drew Jackson
won the starting shortstop posi
tion after starting in 24 games
last season and hitting .207. His
double-play partner at second
base will likely be either fresh
man Tommy Edman or senior
Brett Michael Doran.
Junior Wayne Taylor, who
started 40 games last year for the
Card, will see time at catcher and
left field this season. His duties
behind the plate will be split with
senior Brant Whiting, who led the
team with a .344 average last year
while starting in 36 games. Both
players figure to play every day,

Ail-American after finishing last season second on the Cardinal squad with seven home runs.
with Taylor alternating be
tween left field and catcher
and Whiting shifting be
tween catcher and designat
ed hitter.
The outfield for the Card
is still largely in flux. Junior
Austin Slater, who started 48
games last season, is the on
ly real certainty and will play
center field. Slater batted
second for much of last sea
son while hitting .269 with
32 RBI. Slater shifts over
from right field to replace
Austin Wilson, who was
drafted in the second round
of the 2013 MLB Draft by
the Seattle Mariners. Wil
son missed significant time
due to an injury last season
but still returned to hit .288
with five home runs and 26
RBI while batting in the
cleanup spot.
Junior Dominic Jose,
sophomore Zach Hoffpauir,
sophomore Jonny Locher,
freshman Jack Klein and
freshman Alex Dunlap will
compete for the remaining
one or two outfield spots, de
pending on whether Wayne
Taylor plays in the outfield
on any given day.
"There are some new
faces, so we will kind of fig
ure out what's going to hap
pen after four or five
games," Marquess said.
The biggest hole to fill
for the Cardinal surely
comes in the rotation with
the departure of Mark Ap
pel, who was drafted first
overall to the MLB by the
Houston Astros after four
years with the Cardinal. Ap
pel finished last season as
Stanford's ace with a 10-4
record and a 2.12 ERA in 14
starts. He broke Stanford's

Pac-12 title is always the
goal for the Cardinal, the
season will ultimately be a
success if the Cardinal is
able to make the postseason
tournament, which it failed
to do last year.
"You've just got to get in
the tournament," Marquess
said. "If you play well at the
right time, you can win it."
The first pitch of the sea
son for Stanford is scheduled
for 4:30 p.m. this Friday, Feb.
14, against Rice at Sunken
Diamond.

Stanford baseball officially
kicks off its season this Friday at
Sunken Diamond with several
key returning players and talent
ed new freshmen, but also with
many major holes to fill.
"The 2014 Stanford baseball

team will be a little bit of a combi
nation of youth and experience,"
said head coach Mark Marquess
at Monday's Pac-12 Media Day
"We return five position players
who started or played most of the
year last year Wayne Taylor,
Brant Whiting, Austin Slater,
Alex Blandino and Danny
Diekroeger."

The Cardinal's infield will
largely be composed of returning
players. Junior third baseman
Alex Blandino returns and begins
the season as a Baseball America
preseason second-team Ail-
American. Blandino finished sec
ond on the team last season with
seven home runs and figures to
hit in the heart of the Cardinal's

order.
Senior Danny Diekroeger will
again start for the Cardinal, but
may switch from second base,
where he played for most of his 54
starts last season, to first base.
Brian Ragira previously manned
first for the Cardinal but left to
play professionally after being
drafted by the San Francisco Gi
ants in the fourth round of the
2013 MLB Draft. Ragira led the
team with eight home runs and 42
RBI last season and leaves a gap
in the three-hole in the Stanford
lineup.
"Right now, on Friday we'll
start Danny Diekroeger [at first
base]," Marquess said. "He's
played there before and he will do
a fine job there."
Sophomore Austin Barr will
back up Diekroeger at first base
and will start if Diekroeger ro
tates back to second base. Mar
quess spoke highly of Barr's hit
ting skills and mentioned that
Barr could also see time at desig
nated hitter.
Sophomore Drew Jackson
won the starting shortstop posi
tion after starting in 24 games
last season and hitting .207. His
double-play partner at second
base will likely be either fresh
man Tommy Edman or senior
Brett Michael Doran.
Junior Wayne Taylor, who
started 40 games last year for the
Card, will see time at catcher and
left field this season. His duties
behind the plate will be split with
senior Brant Whiting, who led the
team with a .344 average last year
while starting in 36 games. Both
players figure to play every day,

with Taylor alternating be
tween left field and catcher
and Whiting shifting be
tween catcher and designat
ed hitter.
The outfield for the Card
is still largely in flux. Junior
Austin Slater, who started 48
games last season, is the on
ly real certainty and will play
center field. Slater batted
second for much of last sea
son while hitting .269 with
32 RBI. Slater shifts over
from right field to replace
Austin Wilson, who was
drafted in the second round
of the 2013 MLB Draft by
the Seattle Mariners. Wil
son missed significant time
due to an injury last season
but still returned to hit .288
with five home runs and 26
RBI while batting in the
cleanup spot.
Junior Dominic Jose,
sophomore Zach Hoffpauir,
sophomore Jonny Locher,
freshman Jack Klein and
freshman Alex Dunlap will
compete for the remaining
one or two outfield spots, de
pending on whether Wayne
Taylor plays in the outfield
on any given day.
"There are some new
faces, so we will kind of fig
ure out what's going to hap
pen after four or five
games," Marquess said.
The biggest hole to fill
for the Cardinal surely
comes in the rotation with
the departure of Mark Ap
pel, who was drafted first
overall to the MLB by the
Houston Astros after four
years with the Cardinal. Ap
pel finished last season as
Stanford's ace with a 10-4
record and a 2.12 ERA in 14
starts. He broke Stanford's
all-time strikeout record
and ended his Cardinal ca
reer with 372 strikeouts to
go along with 28 wins. The
loss of his reliable presence
in countering opposing aces
on Friday nights will come
as a major blow to the Card.
"That's about 105 innings
and 10 wins we have to re
place ... [But] we have four
or five guys coming back

who have thrown significant
innings," said Marquess re
garding Appel's departure.
Junior John Hochstatter
figures to be one of the Car
dinal's main options for re
placing Appel as Stanford's
ace. Hochstatter went 3-3
with a 3.88 ERA in 13 starts
mostly on Saturdays
last year for the Cardinal as
the number-two option in
the rotation behind Appel.
While it's unclear whether
or not Hochstatter will claim
Appel's role as the ace, he
brings valuable collegiate
experience to a pitching
staff largely devoid of it.
"[Hochstatter is] a crafty
left-hander not a real
hard-thrower but he knows
how to pitch," Marquess
stated.
Sophomore Bobby Zaru
bin would likely have joined
the starting rotation after
an impressive freshman
year that saw him finish
with a 3-3 record and a 2.16
ERA in 15 appearances, in
cluding 10 starts, but will be
sidelined by a torn labrum.
Likewise, sophomore
left-hander Logan James re
turns after pitching in 17
games last season with a 3-3
record and a 4.56 ERA.
James can either start or
come out of the bullpen and
should compete to be a start
ing pitcher in either the Sun
day rotation spot or as a
starter for non-conference
weekday games.
Several freshman pitch
ers that are expected to con
tribute this season include
Cal Quantrill, Brett
Hanewich, Chris Viall and
Tyler Thorne. Quantrill
could factor into Stanford's
starting rotation as a poten
tial opening-day starter, as
he brings valuable experi
ence after having pitched for
18-U Team Canada for three
years, winning a silver medal
in 2012 at the 18-U World
Championship in Seoul.
While the presumptive
favorites in battling for spots
in the rotation are Hochstat
ter, Quantrill and James, the
rotation remains relatively
unclear. Hanewich, Viall,
Thorne and Schmidt could
potentially become starting
pitchers as well as sopho
mores Daniel Starwalt and

Marcus Brakeman, each of
whom recorded two starts
last season.
On the coaching staff,
Marquess begins his 38th
season at the helm for the
Cardinal. However, he will
be without longtime assis
tant Dean Stotz, who retired
after 37 years with the Car
dinal this past offseason.
Stotz was replaced on the
coaching staff by former
Cardinal first baseman Ryan
Garko 'O3.
The Pac-12 released the
results of the preseason Pac
-12 coaches' poll, which
placed the Cardinal sixth in
the conference behind Ore
gon State, Oregon, UCLA,
Arizona State and Arizona.
Stanford also begins the sea
son ranked at No. 25 in the
USA Today coaches' poll.
"It's no doubt of mine
that we're in the toughest
conference in the country,"
Marquess noted. "The last
two champions have come
out of the Pac-12 Conference
Arizona and UCLA."
Expectations for the Car
dinal are tempered by the
major loss of talent from last
season and the demanding
schedule that the team faces.
Stanford plays seven presea
son top-25 teams, including
No. 3 Oregon State, No. 7
Oregon, No. 8 Yanderbilt,
No. 10 UCLA, No. 15 Rice,
No. 18 Arizona State and
No. 22 Texas.
"That's a very difficult
schedule," Marquess said.
"We will surely find out
where our weaknesses may
be and where we are lacking
... It's a challenge."
While competing for a
Pac-12 title is always the
goal for the Cardinal, the
season will ultimately be a
success if the Cardinal is
able to make the postseason
tournament, which it failed
to do last year.
"You've just got to get in
the tournament," Marquess
said. "If you play well at the
right time, you can win it."
The first pitch of the sea
son for Stanford is scheduled
for 4:30 p.m. this Friday, Feb.
14, against Rice at Sunken
Diamond.
