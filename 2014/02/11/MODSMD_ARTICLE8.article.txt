## READY AND RELOADED Five key position players return for 2014 season 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Stanford baseball officially
kicks off its season this Friday at
Sunken Diamond with several
key returning players and talent
ed new freshmen, but also with
many major holes to fill.
"The 2014 Stanford baseball

team will be a little bit of a combi
nation of youth and experience,"
said head coach Mark Marquess
at Monday's Pac-12 Media Day
"We return five position players
who started or played most of the
year last year Wayne Taylor,
Brant Whiting, Austin Slater,
Alex Blandino and Danny
Diekroeger."

The Cardinal's infield will
largely be composed of returning
players. Junior third baseman
Alex Blandino returns and begins
the season as a Baseball America
preseason second-team Ail-
American. Blandino finished sec
ond on the team last season with
seven home runs and figures to
hit in the heart of the Cardinal's

order.
Senior Danny Diekroeger will
again start for the Cardinal, but
may switch from second base,
where he played for most of his 54
starts last season, to first base.
Brian Ragira previously manned
first for the Cardinal but left to
play professionally after being
drafted by the San Francisco Gi
ants in the fourth round of the
2013 MLB Draft. Ragira led the
team with eight home runs and 42
RBI last season and leaves a gap
in the three-hole in the Stanford
lineup.
"Right now, on Friday we'll
start Danny Diekroeger [at first
base]," Marquess said. "He's
played there before and he will do
a fine job there."
Sophomore Austin Barr will
back up Diekroeger at first base
and will start if Diekroeger ro
tates back to second base. Mar
quess spoke highly of Barr's hit
ting skills and mentioned that
Barr could also see time at desig
nated hitter.
Sophomore Drew Jackson
won the starting shortstop posi
tion after starting in 24 games
last season and hitting .207. His
double-play partner at second
base will likely be either fresh
man Tommy Edman or senior
Brett Michael Doran.
Junior Wayne Taylor, who
started 40 games last year for the
Card, will see time at catcher and
left field this season. His duties
behind the plate will be split with
senior Brant Whiting, who led the
team with a .344 average last year
while starting in 36 games. Both
players figure to play every day,
