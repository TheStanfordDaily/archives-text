# FAMILIAR FINISH
## 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's golf team is
seemingly stuck on seven sev
enth place, that is. For the second
consecutive year, the Cardinal
opened its spring season by finish
ing seventh at the Amer Ari Invita
tional in Kona, Hawaii, which ended
Saturday. It was also the third
straight season in which Stanford
put a player in the individual top
five at the event; this year, senior
Cameron Wilson led the charge, fir
ing a cumulative 14-under-par score
to claim third place.
"We felt positive about our expe
rience in Hawaii," said head coach
Conrad Ray. "Obviously, the result
could've been a little bit better but
the scores were very much bunched
up where we finished shooting
27-under and still finishing in sev
enth place. [l] felt like the guys
fought hard the last two rounds af

ter a slow start."
Thursday's first round was in
deed a sluggish, inauspicious start
for the Card, who checked in after
18 holes in 11th place out of 20
squads and 10 strokes off the fever
ish pace set by No. 2 Oklahoma
State. Wilson survived a rocky
start, which resulted in a double-bo
gey on his opening hole, and went
on to post a 5-under 67 on the par
-72, 7074-yard Waikoloa Kings
Course.

"I was happy with my game this
week," Wilson said. "Like last year,
two to three bad holes hurt my
chances. I had a weird lost ball on
my first hole of the tournament
when I hit a drive that was only a
few paces off the fairway in the
rough. I was proud of how I
bounced back from that unfortunate
break."

Another lucky stroke that Stan
ford and the field received was rela
tively calm weather for the duration

of the event. The forecasted rain
and unpredictable heavy winds did
not arrive and the 20 teams at Amer
Ari combined to shoot 360-under
par and nearly 1300 birdies.
The scoring on the par-3 holes,
however, was a different story. The
combined average score on the
course's four par-3 holes was 3.14,
and Stanford's top five golfers man
aged only six birdies versus nine bo
geys or worse on such holes. Given
his analytical approach, it is not sur
prising that Ray has chosen to con
centrate on improvements in this
area in upcoming practices.
"We're going to focus this com
ing week on some of the nuances we
picked up on," said Ray. "Par-3 scor
ing, in particular, needs some atten
tion. We need to work hard on figur
ing out how to play the par-3 holes a
little bit better as we move through
the spring."

Senior Cameron Wilson (above) carried the team as the lone senior when he posted a cumulative 14-under-par
to finish in third place individually, bouncing back from a double bogey on the opening hole.
For his part, though, Wil
son was 3-under and ac
counted for half of his team's
birdies on the par-3 holes.
His solid play on the shorter
holes each par-3 averaged
just 192 yards enabled
the Connecticut native to get
into the red early and often.
Friday's second round saw
Wilson reel off eight birdies
over a 10-hole stretch en
route to a 7-under 65, a per
formance that gave him the
36-hole lead.
However, he wasn't able
to hold it, as USC's Jeffrey
Kang and individual winner
Jordan Niebrugge of Okla
homa State leapfrogged Wil
son on Sunday to edge Stan
ford's lone senior in the line
up by one and two strokes,
respectively. Highly touted

junior Patrick Rodgers,
ranked amongst the world's
top-25 amateur golfers, also
turned in a top-10 individual
finish propelled by his final
round 6-under 66.

"[I was] happy to see
Cameron and Patrick do well
in their individual efforts,"
Ray said. "I know with some
support from the guys down
in the lineup a bit we should
be in good shape for the
Prestige."
And "the guys down in
the lineup" will certainly
need to perform better than
they did at Amer Ari if the
team is to recognize its goals
of competing for the Pac-12
and national championships
this spring. Sophomore
David Boote had an up-and
down tournament while
playing in the team's num
ber-one slot, shooting 75-69-
71 to finish at T-56th in the
individual standings. Fresh
man Viraat Badhwar round
ed out the scoring four with

a cumulative 2-over 218, T
-77th performance, with
classmate Mav McNealy not
far behind at 4-over for the
event. Junior Patrick Grimes
and freshman Jim Liu
both of whom played as indi
viduals placed T-98th
with 7-over 223 scores.
Ray's squad will take this
week off before teeing up
next Monday at The Pres
tige at PGA West Tourna
ment in La Quinta, Calif.
