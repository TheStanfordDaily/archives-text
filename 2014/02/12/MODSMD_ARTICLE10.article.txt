# SEARCH IN SEATTLE
## 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's basketball
team will attempt to accomplish
something tonight it has never
done under head coach Johnny
Dawkins: defeat the Washington
Huskies in Seattle. Even including
a 79-67 home victory against the
Huskies on Jan. 18, Stanford (15-7,
6-4 Pac-12) owns just a 2-9 record
against Washington (13-11, 5-6)
with Dawkins as head coach. The
losing streak in Seattle spans four
games, with the Cardinal's last win
coming back on Jan. 31,2008, when
Brook Lopez's monster 31-point,
13-rebound performance powered
Stanford to a 65-51 victory.

Tonight's matchup figures to be
an excellent opportunity for Stan
ford to snap the streak, given that
the two teams are currently trend
ing in opposite directions. The Car
dinal has won six of eight and two
straight, including a resounding 80-
69 drubbing of archrival Cal in
Berkeley last week. It may have
been the team's most complete per
formance to date this season, as
Stanford staked itself out to a big
lead early and then successfully
shut down any comeback attempts
by the feisty Bears, which had just
beaten then-No. 1 Arizona in its
previous game.
The Cardinal has found its
recipe for success by playing solid
man-to-man defense, having held

its opponents to just 40.3 percent
shooting over its past four games.
Stanford will look to do more of the
same on Wednesday night in Seat
tle, where the Huskies' offense has
certainly not been kind to the Car
dinal in recent trips to the Emerald
City. During the last four meetings
at Alaska Airlines Arena, the
Huskies have averaged 85.3 points
per game on 47.9 percent shooting.
The good news for the Cardinal
is that the matchup between the
two teams appears to be different
this year from other recent ones, as
evidenced by Stanford's victory
earlier this season against the
Huskies. Defense was the catalyst

Junior guard Chasson Randle (left) matched his career high with 33 points against Washington on Jan. 18.
Tonight, he will look to continue the aggressive play that earned him 13 free throws in that earlier game.
for the Cardinal in that per
formance, as Husky star
senior guard C.J. Wilcox was
held to just nine points on 4-
of-13 shooting, 10 below his
season average. Look for
Stanford senior Anthony
Brown to again hound
Wilcox all night long in an at
tempt to shut down one of
the Pac-12's most lethal scor
ers.
Washington, on the other
hand, enters Wednesday's
contest searching for an
swers, having been swept on
the road last week by the
likes of Utah and Colorado.
Sunday's loss to the Buf
faloes was particularly dis
heartening for Husky fans,
as Washington was out
played in every facet of the
game en route to a 26-point
blowout loss. The Huskies

allowed the Buffaloes to
shoot 55 percent from the
field in surrendering 91
points, the highest total con
ceded by Washington since it
gave up 102 to Indiana on
Nov. 21.
Although the Huskies are
certainly not playing their
best ball of the season at the
moment, the Cardinal would
be foolish to take them light
ly. Whatever has ailed Wash
ington on the road this sea
son seems to magically cure
itself at home. The Huskies
are 11-2 this season within
the friendly confines of Alas
ka Airlines Arena, including
a 4-0 mark in conference
play.
The Cardinal will hope to
continue to ride the strong
play of senior forward
Dwight Powell, who has
been particularly assertive
of late. In his last two con
tests, Powell is averaging 25
points, 10 rebounds and 5.5
assists, both Stanford wins
over tournament-caliber

teams Cal and Arizona
State. He certainly poses a
matchup problem for the
Huskies, who feature just
one player in their rotation
taller than 6-foot-8.

In addition to Powell, jun
ior guard Chasson Randle
will look to duplicate his per
formance from the last time
these two teams met. Randle
matched his career high with
33 points against the
Huskies on Jan. 18, and he
did it by being aggressive at
tacking the hoop. Randle
made just one 3-pointer and
shot 13 free throws during
his big night. A similar level
of confident play by Randle
could once more result in a
big night for the confer
ence's third-leading scorer,
as Washington's defense has
certainly struggled of late.
Tipoff is set for tonight at
6 p.m., and the game will be
televised on ESPN2.

shut down any comeback attempts
by the feisty Bears, which had just
beaten then-No. 1 Arizona in its
previous game.
The Cardinal has found its
recipe for success by playing solid
man-to-man defense, having held

its opponents to just 40.3 percent
shooting over its past four games.
Stanford will look to do more of the
same on Wednesday night in Seat
tle, where the Huskies' offense has
certainly not been kind to the Car
dinal in recent trips to the Emerald
City. During the last four meetings
at Alaska Airlines Arena, the
Huskies have averaged 85.3 points
per game on 47.9 percent shooting.
The good news for the Cardinal
is that the matchup between the
two teams appears to be different
this year from other recent ones, as
evidenced by Stanford's victory
earlier this season against the
Huskies. Defense was the catalyst

Tonight, he will look to continue the aggressive play that earned him 13 free throws in that earlier game.
for the Cardinal in that per
formance, as Husky star
senior guard C.J. Wilcox was
held to just nine points on 4-
of-13 shooting, 10 below his
season average. Look for
Stanford senior Anthony
Brown to again hound
Wilcox all night long in an at
tempt to shut down one of
the Pac-12's most lethal scor
ers.
Washington, on the other
hand, enters Wednesday's
contest searching for an
swers, having been swept on
the road last week by the
likes of Utah and Colorado.
Sunday's loss to the Buf
faloes was particularly dis
heartening for Husky fans,
as Washington was out
played in every facet of the
game en route to a 26-point
blowout loss. The Huskies

allowed the Buffaloes to
shoot 55 percent from the
field in surrendering 91
points, the highest total con
ceded by Washington since it
gave up 102 to Indiana on
Nov. 21.
Although the Huskies are
certainly not playing their
best ball of the season at the
moment, the Cardinal would
be foolish to take them light
ly. Whatever has ailed Wash
ington on the road this sea
son seems to magically cure
itself at home. The Huskies
are 11-2 this season within
the friendly confines of Alas
ka Airlines Arena, including
a 4-0 mark in conference
play.
The Cardinal will hope to
continue to ride the strong
play of senior forward
Dwight Powell, who has
been particularly assertive
of late. In his last two con
tests, Powell is averaging 25
points, 10 rebounds and 5.5
assists, both Stanford wins
over tournament-caliber

teams Cal and Arizona
State. He certainly poses a
matchup problem for the
Huskies, who feature just
one player in their rotation
taller than 6-foot-8.

In addition to Powell, jun
ior guard Chasson Randle
will look to duplicate his per
formance from the last time
these two teams met. Randle
matched his career high with
33 points against the
Huskies on Jan. 18, and he
did it by being aggressive at
tacking the hoop. Randle
made just one 3-pointer and
shot 13 free throws during
his big night. A similar level
of confident play by Randle
could once more result in a
big night for the confer
ence's third-leading scorer,
as Washington's defense has
certainly struggled of late.
Tipoff is set for tonight at
6 p.m., and the game will be
televised on ESPN2.

The Stanford men's basketball
team will attempt to accomplish
something tonight it has never
done under head coach Johnny
Dawkins: defeat the Washington
Huskies in Seattle. Even including
a 79-67 home victory against the
Huskies on Jan. 18, Stanford (15-7,
6-4 Pac-12) owns just a 2-9 record
against Washington (13-11, 5-6)
with Dawkins as head coach. The
losing streak in Seattle spans four
games, with the Cardinal's last win
coming back on Jan. 31,2008, when
Brook Lopez's monster 31-point,
13-rebound performance powered
Stanford to a 65-51 victory.

Tonight's matchup figures to be
an excellent opportunity for Stan
ford to snap the streak, given that
the two teams are currently trend
ing in opposite directions. The Car
dinal has won six of eight and two
straight, including a resounding 80-
69 drubbing of archrival Cal in
Berkeley last week. It may have
been the team's most complete per
formance to date this season, as
Stanford staked itself out to a big
lead early and then successfully
shut down any comeback attempts
by the feisty Bears, which had just
beaten then-No. 1 Arizona in its
previous game.
