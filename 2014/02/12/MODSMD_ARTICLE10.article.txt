# SEARCH IN SEATTLE
## 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's basketball
team will attempt to accomplish
something tonight it has never
done under head coach Johnny
Dawkins: defeat the Washington
Huskies in Seattle. Even including
a 79-67 home victory against the
Huskies on Jan. 18, Stanford (15-7,
6-4 Pac-12) owns just a 2-9 record
against Washington (13-11, 5-6)
with Dawkins as head coach. The
losing streak in Seattle spans four
games, with the Cardinal's last win
coming back on Jan. 31,2008, when
Brook Lopez's monster 31-point,
13-rebound performance powered
Stanford to a 65-51 victory.

Tonight's matchup figures to be
an excellent opportunity for Stan
ford to snap the streak, given that
the two teams are currently trend
ing in opposite directions. The Car
dinal has won six of eight and two
straight, including a resounding 80-
69 drubbing of archrival Cal in
Berkeley last week. It may have
been the team's most complete per
formance to date this season, as
Stanford staked itself out to a big
lead early and then successfully
shut down any comeback attempts
by the feisty Bears, which had just
beaten then-No. 1 Arizona in its
previous game.
The Cardinal has found its
recipe for success by playing solid
man-to-man defense, having held

its opponents to just 40.3 percent
shooting over its past four games.
Stanford will look to do more of the
same on Wednesday night in Seat
tle, where the Huskies' offense has
certainly not been kind to the Car
dinal in recent trips to the Emerald
City. During the last four meetings
at Alaska Airlines Arena, the
Huskies have averaged 85.3 points
per game on 47.9 percent shooting.
The good news for the Cardinal
is that the matchup between the
two teams appears to be different
this year from other recent ones, as
evidenced by Stanford's victory
earlier this season against the
Huskies. Defense was the catalyst

Junior guard Chasson Randle (left) matched his career high with 33 points against Washington on Jan. 18.
Tonight, he will look to continue the aggressive play that earned him 13 free throws in that earlier game.
