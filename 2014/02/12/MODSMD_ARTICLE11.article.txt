## Winning streak on the line Mochalski leads Card as new starter 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
After a dominating perform
ance at home last week against
UC-Irvine, No. 8 Stanford
men's volleyball (7-4, 4-4
MPSF) will play its first Febru
ary road game tonight at Pacific
before returning home to host
No. 4 BYU on Friday at Maples
Pavilion. The Cardinal will look
to extend its current three
match winning streak, in which
it has shut out its last three op
ponents at Maples Pavilion.
Pacific (2-9,1-7) is coming off
of a victory over UC-San Diego
on Saturday just a day after
Stanford defeated UC-San
Diego in straight sets at Maples.
Pacific was led in that match by
freshman outside hitter Thomas
Hodges, who enjoyed a career
high 23 kills. He hit .354
recording only six errors and
had 11 digs for the match. With
Stanford having won three of its
last four games at home after
winning only one of four away
from Maples, it will be interest
ing to see how the Cardinal han
dles returning to the road, even
for a short trip like this one.
After its match against Pacif
ic, Stanford will host the fourth
ranked Cougars (8-3,8-1), which
currently lead the MPSF stand
ings by a half game over UCLA.
The Cardinal has already faced
the Cougars once this season in
a tough four-set defeat on the
road. After that game, head
coach John Kosty noted that the
crowd in Provo, Utah played a
significant role in key moments
of the match the last time
around. Home-court advantage
for the Cardinal could make a
difference in this key confer
ence matchup.
Furthermore, BYU is com
ing off a 10-day break from
playing and could thus be slight
ly rusty, in stark contrast to the
Cardinal, which will be coming
off of a stretch of five matches in
14 days.
BYU's offense is led by out
side hitter Taylor Sander, who
ranks fourth in the nation with
4.33 kills per set. He also ranks
fifth in the country with his 22
aces so far this season. The Car-
dinal, which has limited its
opponents' hitting games
and has out-blocked its oppo
nents in each of its last two
matches, must find away to
return Sander's serves and
limit his kill opportunities.

Eric Mochalski will look to
continue his hot streak after
being named the AVCA
Men's Division I-II National
Player of the Week. In last
weekend's matches, which
marked the first times he
started at opposite this sea
son, Mochalski averaged
3.60 kills per set and hit .448.
While the honor demon
strates his tangible signifi
cance to the team, his leader
ship over the past few weeks

has been equally important
while the Cardinal has re
gained confidence and mo
mentum. He will look to
build on his success at the
outside position in the up
coming matches this week.
First serve for Wednes
day's match against Pacific
is set for 7 p.m. in Stockton,
Calif.
