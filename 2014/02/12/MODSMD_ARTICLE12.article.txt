### DYLAN FUGEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 2 Cardinal women's water polo team (4-0, 0-0
MPSF) will look to continue its strong start to the season
tonight when it travels to Santa Clara to take on the No. 20
Broncos (3-4,0-0 Golden Coast Conference) in what should
be a competitive matchup.
The Cardinal is coming off of a stellar opening to its
season, when it defended its Stanford Invitational title by
knocking off four ranked opponents, including a solid win
over No. 3 UCLA by a score of 8-4 in the final.

Player of the Week to cap a week in which she scored 11
