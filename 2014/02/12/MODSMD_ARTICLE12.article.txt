# BATTLE WITH BRONCOS

### DYLAN FUGEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 2 Cardinal women's water polo team (4-0, 0-0
MPSF) will look to continue its strong start to the season
tonight when it travels to Santa Clara to take on the No. 20
Broncos (3-4,0-0 Golden Coast Conference) in what should
be a competitive matchup.
The Cardinal is coming off of a stellar opening to its
season, when it defended its Stanford Invitational title by
knocking off four ranked opponents, including a solid win
over No. 3 UCLA by a score of 8-4 in the final.
Junior driver Kiley Neushul was named the MPSF
Player of the Week to cap a week in which she scored 11

goals over the course of the
invitational to pace the Car
dinal to victory in a loaded
field. She opened the tourna
ment with a five-goal match
against UC-Davis and a hat
trick against Hawaii, which
she followed up with two
goals against UC-Irvine and
a further goal in the tourna
ment final.
Apart from Neushul,
sophomore drivers Anna
Yelizarova and Maggie Stef
fens have contributed a
number of key goals, while
sophomore goalie Gabby
Stone has made a parade of
fantastic saves throughout
the non-conference sched
ule. Comparing the two
teams' respective schedules
would seems to hint towards
a Stanford victory, as UC-
Santa Clara lost 13-8 to a

Hawaii team that Stanford
comfortably beat in the
group stages of the Stanford
Invite by a score of 16-5.
Stanford has exhibited a
potent mix of offensive fire
power and defensive steel at
various points during the
four matches it has played so
far, averaging 13.25 goals
scored against only 5.25 con
ceded. In what was perhaps
its most impressive period of
play, it held No. 3 UCLA
scoreless for almost 12 min
utes in the final of the Stan
ford Invitational.
However, Santa Clara is
not a team to be taken light
ly. Senior utility player
Kaitlin Murphy leads the
team with 12 goals, and is
ably backed up by Peters
and sophomore driver Erin
Sheridan. While the Broncos
may be currently riding a
three-game losing streak,
they will look to spring the
upset and take down the
Cardinal this Wednesday.
The game will be contest-

Ed at Santa Clara's Sullivan
Aquatic Center and will
mark the first ever instance
of a "green" game hosted by
the Broncos. Thanks to the
work of sophomore two-me
ter Julia Peters, sustainable
living will be heavily promot
ed at the game, and teams
will be encouraged to avoid
waste stemming from ener
gy bar wrappers, ice bags
and food scraps. Both teams
will also be called upon to re
place their plastic water bot
tles with reusable bottles.
Stanford even plans to take
the Caltrain down to the
game in order to further re
duce carbon emissions.

Even the presence of
such noble initiatives, how
ever, will not prevent the
Cardinal from attempting to
take home another decisive
victory. The match will start
at 4 p.m. in Santa Clara,
Calif.
