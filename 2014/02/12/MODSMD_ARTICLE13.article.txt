## John Manley The
						Progressive Legacy of Ron Rebholz 
### JOHN F. MANLEY 
Ron Rebholz was not just an
inspiring teacher of Shake
speare. He was throughout
his years at Stanford a principled,
courageous political activist who
challenged the University to live up
to its highest ideals, and regularly
found it all too often a failure. You
could write a good history of Stan
ford by following the life of Ron
Rebholz. For a dozen years or so, I
was privileged to have Ron as a
friend and fellow troublemaker.
I met Ron Rebholz when I was
gathering signatures in a petition
calling for an investigation of the
political activities of the Hoover In
stitution. Someone mentioned an
English professor who might sign,
so I contacted Ron.
Ron was a member of the Facul
ty Senate and he suggested that we
focus the petition on the Senate. On
May 26, 1983, after Ron and I ad
dressed the Senate, it voted "over
whelmingly" to urge the Board of
Trustees to study the relationship
between Hoover and the Universi
ty. The fight was joined.
The roots of the Hoover fight lie
in the Political Science Depart
ment. When Hoover's help was
sought in retaining a professor who
had an outside offer, its director W
Glenn Campbell declined, citing the
department's lack of "sufficient
reciprocity" toward Hoover. Two
names were mentioned as possible
joint appointments.
If the Hoover proposal were ac
cepted, department appointments
would not be based solely on the
best candidates identified in na
tional searches, but partly, at least,
on a quid pro quo with Hoover. I
called the proposal improper but it
made me curious about Hoover, so I
got a copy of its 1982 Annual Re
port. I found there all of the evi
dence needed from an unim
peachable source that Hoover
was extensively involved politically.
The Report proudly took credit
for playing a major role in Ronald
Reagan's political career. Reagan
openly thanked the Institution for
its help. Martin Anderson from
Hoover was appointed a leading do
mestic advisor, and Richard Allen
was appointed National Security
Advisor. The joke around Hoover
was, last one out for Washing
ton turn out the lights.
The question Ron and I asked
was, What is such an institu
tion doing on a university
campus ? By allowing Hoover to
pursue its objectives aided by the
good name of the University, Stan
ford crossed a line. The only an
swer for us was a divorce.
At first, Donald Kennedy and
the Trustees in response to the
Senate vote discussed appointing
an independent, distinguished vis
iting committee, but this was soon
shelved. Kennedy decided to ap
point a committee chaired by a po
litical scientist with a joint appoint
ment at Hoover. Kennedy charged
the Ward Committee with finding
ways of strengthening ties be
tween the two institutions.
A critical committee review ran
the risk of imposing controls on
Hoover, which prospect had strong
opponents in Hoover's and Stan
ford's camp. No one representing
our views or the Senate's was on
the committee. The Ward report
endorsed closer ties between
Hoover and Stanford, going as far
as criticizing some departments for
their hostility to joint appoint
ments.
What we did not know at the
time was that secret talks were be
ing held between the University
and the White House, guided by
Hoover, to bring the Reagan Presi
dential Library and the Reagan
Center for Public Affairs to Stan
ford.
Wasting no time, W. Glenn
Campbell opened discussions over
the Reagan Library in 1981. He,
Ed Meese and Kennedy relied on
the obvious academic value of a
presidential library, but others cit
ed the already strong ties between
Stanford and the Reagan Adminis
tration. Especially objectionable
was the Reagan Center for Public
Affairs, which Campbell insisted
would be run by Hoover. Campbell
and the White House's demand
that the Center be run by Hoover
almost scuttled the entire project.
A 1988 petition signed by 57 Stan
ford faculty members demanded
that the Center be subject to nor
mal academic governance. The
White House reluctantly agreed to
this, and, with that, the project was
set for Stanford.
There the matter stood until ar
chitectural plans for the project
created a new firestorm of objec

tions. The size of the project sched
uled for the foothills overlooking
Lake Lagunita, and the prospect of
busloads of visitors offended envi
ronmentalists, homeowners and, of
course, Ron and me. All this proved
too much for the White House,
which withdrew the offer. Had
Kennedy, the Trustees and the
Hoover Institution had their way,
the complex would today be grac
ing the foothills not far from where
we are sitting.
After the Reagan Library pro
posal died, another controversy
broke out when we learned that
Stanford had for decades rented
land for a migrant farm where
workers lived and worked in pover
ty. Again we turned to Kennedy for
action, and again we failed to get it.
Kennedy's response was a sur
prise. He declared that Stanford
had no more responsibility for
Webb Ranch workers than for Ma
cy's employees who also work on
Stanford land. The university's
lawyers and Kennedy simply ig
nored the obvious differences be
tween migrant farm workers and
employees at the Stanford Shop
ping Center.
After Kennedy resigned, his
successors, Gerhard Casper and
John Hennessey, were publicly
asked to intervene on behalf of the
Webb workers, but they reaffirmed
the legalistic reply of Kennedy. Af
ter a long struggle, the workers at
Webb Ranch voted to join the Unit
ed Stanford Workers, and remain
members today. It should be noted
that when negotiations with the
Webbs bogged down, Kennedy did
intervene with a threat to turn the
land over to academic use, which
was followed soon by a labor-man
agement agreement.
The forced resignation of Camp
bell at age 65 opened the way for a
new, more skillful director of
Hoover, John Raisian, who joined
Kennedy in establishing closer,
more agreeable ties between
Hoover and Stanford. Hoover's
mission, however, remains the
same: Hoover's 2010 Annual Re
port repeats Herbert Hoover's di
rective that the Institution is not,
and must not be, a mere library.
Hoover continues major efforts to
influence public opinion through
hundreds of op-ed pieces, the In
ternet, a television series, a large
media fellowship program and the
Hoover Press. Hoover has tem
pered its rhetoric but still pushes
its agenda, aided by the good name
of Stanford.
To students: telling the truth
does not mean the truth will pre
vail, for the power of power is for
midable. Most importantly: don't
give up. Much work remains to be
done at Stanford.
Thank you.
