# FROM THE OPINIONS DESK
## Solutionism and its Discontents 
### Winston Shi 
We live in a world that has a
lot of problems; that much
is for certain. Here on the
Farm, we see problems every day
the expected mixture of the sim
ple and the insurmountable. There
are problems everywhere, palm
trees and eternal sunshine notwith
standing, and they range from our
problem sets to the California
drought to world poverty. But Stan
ford University is a place where to
not have all the solutions seems to
be an act of defiance against God.
Unlike Stanford's own Evgeny
Morozov, I do not intend to excori
ate "solutionism" the idea that
every problem can eventually be
solved. One of the great selling
points of Stanford is the hope that
permeates it: the belief, so stub
bornly upheld on campus, that any
thing is possible. This belief is a
hope that lights the lamp of
progress, because a belief in the
possibility of progress is part of
what ultimately makes progress
possible. But this belief is also a dis
orienting one: it seems that the
problems we face at Stanford are
viewed not as issues in and of them
selves, but as mere foils to the
forces of inevitable progress.
What progress do we seek? The
popular critique of Stanford solu
tionism typically limits itself to
technology, but that's silly —we
don't set our sights so low. The New
Progress is not merely technologi
cal but social and economic all at
once. It is subsidiary to no political
creed: the Republican attempting
to prevent broken families with
government subsidies is as solution
ist as the Democrat attempting to
legislate equality. And as you might
agree, the policies that a solutionist
mindset can support are not neces
sarily wrong.
In fact, I contend that the effects
of solutionism are not where that
ideology ultimately falls short. Solu
tionism is a product of three founda
tional misconceptions: the illusion of
uniformity, the illusion of unique
ness and above all the illusion of in
evitability.
The first, uniformity, is the easi
est to refute. Stanford is often la
beled as the beating heart of Amer
ican solutionism, but while the Sili
con Valley that it fosters is founded

upon the belief that problems have
solutions, the Valley itself is a con
tradiction of that belief. Glitzy start
ups and the bright-eyed entrepre
neurs that create them fail all the
time: Just because people can
propose a solution to a problem,
doesn't mean that it is the right
one or that it is practical.
Moreover, although Stanford
and Silicon Valley are intertwined,
they are not the same. We are not
frozen in an endless monolith:
Stanford is not purely high technol
ogy and palm trees, although that
is the image that we like to culti
vate. That much should be obvious
to anybody living here, but even so,
startup culture the primary in
stitution of solutionist thought
largely influences what the rest of
the world thinks of us. We're seen
as the guys waving our smart
phones all over the place, blithely
yelling "There's an app for that."

Solutionism's allure is also in
tertwined with the common percep
tion that its movement is historical
ly unique. I don't mean this as a
criticism of Stanford the oppor
tunities the University offers us are
very hard to replicate. But if I may
offer a more subjective opinion: We
view technology here, broadly, as a
continuing and perhaps even self
sustaining revolution. And in order

to succeed, every revolution must
first convince its people that it will
succeed where others failed.
Improvements in technology,
while special, are nothing new. The
explosion of scientific progress that
we are lucky enough to celebrate is,
to be fair, unprecedented. Even
considering this, however, people
have always tried to solve the prob
lems we face. Some of these move
ments have failed; others have suc
ceeded, and their successes are the
foundation of the world we see to
day.
A belief in uniqueness is ulti
mately what sustains the myth of
solutionism: If solutionism had ex
isted before and failed, its impossi
bility would be immediately obvi
ous. But if solutionism is mistaken
ly held to be unique, in that unique
ness lies a hope that all problems
can eventually be solved. Anything
is possible: compromise is a swear
word. "Are you. playing God?"
the biologist Craig Venter was once
asked. His immortal reply: "We're
not playing."
Carried away by our emotions
and our hope, at times glory almost
seems inevitable. There is no issue
with hope. But the popular concep
tion of solutionism goes beyond
that. Solutionism is not just a belief
that everything can be solved but a
belief that everything will be
solved. It preaches not just possi
bility but inevitability. And in that
regard it is an utter delusion.
The increasing prevalence of
startups selling innovation that is
often marginal at best ask any
venture capitalist about the success
rate of an entrepreneurial invest
ment indicates that while there
is plenty of intelligence to go
around, we may be trying too hard
to find the next Google. There is far
too much money in the system, and
if we will assume for a second that
an investment is a declaration of
confidence, it's then painfully clear
that we suffer from an excess of
hope. It is Alan Greenspan's "irra
tional exuberance" all over again.
Ultimately, however, I choose to
take heart in the hope that we up
hold. It is in vogue in this country
to be upset with our government
because we still expect and hope for
so much from it. Similarly if we ex
press disappointment with the
world we have today, it is only be
cause we know that the future can
be better.
With that in mind, even if we as
sume that every problem can be
solved, we cannot assume that
every problem will be. And while
the personal freedom that we cher
ish implicitly argues that different
people can have different solutions
to the same problem, we don't real
ly give variation and ambiguity the
honor that they deserve. It is both
acceptable and unavoidable to have
no solution or multiple solutions. In
this tension between our reality and
our dreams "crawling between
earth and heaven" —we find art.
You do not solve the human condi
tion. You seek to live with it.
It is not possible to solve all of
our problems, and the solutions we
may find are not necessarily the so
lutions that everybody will accept.
While we should never temper our
expectations, we should certainly
adjust our more single-minded pre
dictions. A single solution is not nec
essarily real or universally desir
able. If we would have peace in our
society, we must accept that com
promise is inevitable and the
compromises we must make are not
just with others but also with our
selves.
