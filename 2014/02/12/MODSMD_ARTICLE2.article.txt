## Stanford to lead new stem cell research center 
### KATHERINE CARR 
Stanford will collaborate with the Salk Institute
for Biological Studies to lead a new Center for Ex
cellence in Stem Cell Genomics starting this
spring, in an initiative backed by a $4O million
grant from the California Institute for Regenera
tive Medicine

Professor of Genetics Michael Snyder and Salk
Institute professor Joseph Ecker will lead the new in-

stitute, which will apply the grant
towards three main areas of re
search cardiovascular disease,
single-cell mapping and compu
tational networking of genes.
Nearly half the grant, or $l9
million, will be applied toward
promoting collaborative efforts
with partner institutions in
cluding UC-Santa Cruz, UC-

San Diego, the Scripps Research Institute and ll
lumina, Inc. with regards to research technolo
gy and findings.
"We're bringing together the best experts in
each field," Snyder said, noting that Stanford has
particular expertise in genomics, DNA sequencing
and genetics to contribute.
Snyder himself will lead the cardiovascular
project, while other Stanford professors will also
contribute to the collaboration. Reflecting on the
collective endeavor, Snyder noted that stem cell
research has advanced rapidly in recent years.
"In the four and a half years I have been at
Stanford, stem cell research has taken off like a
shot," he reflected.
While the new center is still taking shape, Sny
der and Ecker have a history of collaboration, hav
ing shared a lab at Stanford earlier in their aca
demic careers.
"We know each other from our days at Stanford
in the Biochemistry department," Ecker con
firmed. "We worked together as post-doc fellows
in Ron David's lab."
Though participating institutions will work on
unique individual projects, Ecker, who will head


Michael Snyder
the collaborative effort, ex
pressed optimism that indi
vidual labs will share infor
mation and findings with
each other and with the
broader research commu
nity.
"A center project aids the
center, but also beyond the
center, it bolsters genomic

research throughout Cali
fornia," Ecker observed.
Snyder emphasized the
opportunities for principal
investigators, graduate stu
dents and undergraduates
from Stanford to work at the
new center.
"We have amazing stu
dents," said Snyder. "I love
the culture at Stanford, it's
inventive and people think
crazy ideas."
