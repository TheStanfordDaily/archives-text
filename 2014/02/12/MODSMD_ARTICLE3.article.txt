All buildings in the area had been re
opened by 1:49 p.m., following the is
suance of an "all clear" notification by
campus police.

While "officers respond to suspicious
packages and abandoned backpacks on
campus on a somewhat routine basis," ac
cording to Stanford Police Chief Laura
Wilson '9l, the backpack's location
prompted a more pronounced response.
In addition to the closure of several
buildings in the White Plaza area, includ
ing Dinkelspiel Auditorium, the Faculty
Club and Old Union, the Stanford Univer
sity Department of Public Safety
(SUDPS) advised people in buildings
along Salvatierra Walk to shelter in place
and called in Santa Clara Country Sherif

gate further. Members of the Palo Alto
Fire Department and the Santa Clara
County Hazardous Materials Emergency
Response Team were also called onto the
scene.
The campus community was first noti
fied of the incident with an AlertSU at
9:28 a.m. Online updates and further
AlertSU notifications followed throughout
the morning until a final alert notifying
recipients that police had found no threat

"I was impressed by the
community's remarkable
discipline in staying away
from the area," Wilson told
the Stanford News Service.

reported delays of up to an

sity administrators have pre

viously acknowledged limita
tions in the Alei'tSU sys
tem's ability to quickly reach
the campus community in its
entirety.
SUDPS spokesman Bill

are currently analyzing
study notes found inside the
