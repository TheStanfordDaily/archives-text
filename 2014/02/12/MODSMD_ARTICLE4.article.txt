## New solar panel installations approved 
### MADELEINE HAN DESK EDITOR 
Provost John Etchemendy
Ph.D. 'B2 recently approved an
Office of Sustainability initiative
to install solar panels on a park
ing structure and on twelve oth
er buildings across campus as a
companion project to the Stan
ford Energy Systems Innova
tions (SESI) initiative.
The panels will increase the
total wattage provided by pho
tovoltaic cells on campus by
nearly a factor of six, from 672
kilowatts to a projected four
megawatts. The new panels will
also up the percentage of ener
gy derived from photovoltaic
cells relative to the campus's

overall energy consumption,
from under one percent to about
10 percent.
According to Fahmida
Ahmed, associate director of the
Office of Sustainability, the pan
els will accompany the Stanford
Energy System Innovations
(SESI) initiative, which was ap
proved by the Board of Trustees
in 2011. SESI aims to move
Stanford away from a cogenera
tion energy system reliant on
natural gas towards a heat re
covery system that will ac
cording to Stanford Facts re
duce campus greenhouse emis
sions by 50 percent.
The new energy system fea
tures an electricity-based power
plant that will also open up op

tions to transition from fossil fu
el-based technology to open
source technology. The solar
panels' installation will supple
ment the system by expanding
its range of clean energy
sources.
According to Scott Gould,
senior engineer for building en
ergy systems commissioning,
some developmental work on
the panels' installation took
place in Stanford labs. The pan
el project has also incorporated
assistance from student groups
like the Stanford Solar and
Wind Energy Project (SWEP)
and Students for a Sustainable
Stanford (SSS).
Ahmed explained that stu
dents have been involved with

SESI since its inception, per
forming tasks like testing the
efficiency of the initial photo
voltaic modules, supporting re
search on renewables and
spreading the word about sus
tainability initiatives to other
students.
Josh Lappen 'l7, a member
of the SSS energy and climate
subgroup, said that he hopes
this project will excite more stu
dents about sustainability ef
forts on campus.
"The issue with environmen
tal conservation concerns, espe
cially with energy production, is
that it doesn't seem like any
thing on a small scale or even on
