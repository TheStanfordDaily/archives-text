## New solar panel installations approved 
### MADELEINE HAN DESK EDITOR 
Provost John Etchemendy
Ph.D. 'B2 recently approved an
Office of Sustainability initiative
to install solar panels on a park
ing structure and on twelve oth
er buildings across campus as a
companion project to the Stan
ford Energy Systems Innova
tions (SESI) initiative.
The panels will increase the
total wattage provided by pho
tovoltaic cells on campus by
nearly a factor of six, from 672
kilowatts to a projected four
megawatts. The new panels will
also up the percentage of ener
gy derived from photovoltaic
cells relative to the campus's

overall energy consumption,
from under one percent to about
10 percent.
According to Fahmida
Ahmed, associate director of the
Office of Sustainability, the pan
els will accompany the Stanford
Energy System Innovations
(SESI) initiative, which was ap
proved by the Board of Trustees
in 2011. SESI aims to move
Stanford away from a cogenera
tion energy system reliant on
natural gas towards a heat re
covery system that will ac
cording to Stanford Facts re
duce campus greenhouse emis
sions by 50 percent.
The new energy system fea
tures an electricity-based power
plant that will also open up op

tions to transition from fossil fu
el-based technology to open
source technology. The solar
panels' installation will supple
ment the system by expanding
its range of clean energy
sources.
According to Scott Gould,
senior engineer for building en
ergy systems commissioning,
some developmental work on
the panels' installation took
place in Stanford labs. The pan
el project has also incorporated
assistance from student groups
like the Stanford Solar and
Wind Energy Project (SWEP)
and Students for a Sustainable
Stanford (SSS).
Ahmed explained that stu
dents have been involved with

SESI since its inception, per
forming tasks like testing the
efficiency of the initial photo
voltaic modules, supporting re
search on renewables and
spreading the word about sus
tainability initiatives to other
students.
Josh Lappen 'l7, a member
of the SSS energy and climate
subgroup, said that he hopes
this project will excite more stu
dents about sustainability ef
forts on campus.
"The issue with environmen
tal conservation concerns, espe
cially with energy production, is
that it doesn't seem like any
thing on a small scale or even on


VICTOR XU/The Stanford Daily
a university scale can make a
difference in the larger
worldwide impact," Lappen
said. "This is a project big
enough that I think the im
pact is evident."
While SESI is scheduled
to finish construction in
April 2015, the timeline for
installing the panels remains
subject to finding a financial
partner for the project as
well as the installation of ba
sic infrastructure, like elec
trical conduits, in the target
ed buildings.
For students like Lap
pen, the project is more than
just an environmental initia
tive it is the University's
attempt to lead by example.
"Stanford exhorts us to
provide moral leadership,"
Lappen said. "Energy pro
duction that isn't clean or re
newable doesn't just impact
the environment. It impacts

people, like those who live
near a coal power plant or
people who live in low-lying
areas where water is rising
in other parts of the world."
"I think [the project] is in
line with our core values as a
community at Stanford to
take responsibility for what
we're getting here," he con
tinued. "People are excited
to see that the University is
very much in tune with de
veloping thought on this ...
that it's our job to help pay
back."
