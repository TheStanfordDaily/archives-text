## Trustees discuss rise in tuition, new housing 
### MINKEE SOHN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford University Board of Trustees
met on Monday and Tuesday of this week to dis
cuss issues ranging from an increase in tuition to
the construction of new facilities and housing.
The Board approved a 3.5 percent increase in
undergraduate tuition for the 2014-15 academic
year. Board Chair Steven Denning MBA '7B, em
phasized, however, that nominal increases in the
cost of tuition in recent years have largely been
offset by the University's financial aid commit
ments.
"Stanford's one of the few institutions where
we've had no real increase in net dollars over the
past decade," Denning said. "The net cost of at
tending Stanford, including room and board, has
actually gone down five percent in real dollars
over the last decade."
The Board also heard an update on residential
education from Senior Associate Vice Provost for
Residential Affairs Nadeem Hussain '9O.
"[Hussain] is a ball of fire," Denning said.
"The Board was very enthusiastic about his pres
entation."
Although Denning declined to discuss the ex
act content of Hussain's presentation, he de
scribed a sustained commitment to the residen
tial experience as an essential part of a Stanford
education even as online learning gains traction.
"That residential element is not just where
you live and eat... it's a part of your education,"
Denning said.
Last Sunday afternoon, current and former
members of the Board participated in a naming
ceremony for the new Donald Kennedy Graduate
Residences in Escondido Village. Each of the four
houses within the residence, which is named after
the former president, is named for a different
Stanford provost.
"We thought it was a very appropriate time to
recognize those five leaders in terms of their con
tribution to what Stanford is today," Denning
said.
The Board also heard a presentation from
Lloyd Minor, dean of the School of Medicine, on
the future of Stanford medicine. According to
