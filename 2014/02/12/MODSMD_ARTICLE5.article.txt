## Trustees discuss rise in tuition, new housing 
### MINKEE SOHN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford University Board of Trustees
met on Monday and Tuesday of this week to dis
cuss issues ranging from an increase in tuition to
the construction of new facilities and housing.
The Board approved a 3.5 percent increase in
undergraduate tuition for the 2014-15 academic
year. Board Chair Steven Denning MBA '7B, em
phasized, however, that nominal increases in the
cost of tuition in recent years have largely been
offset by the University's financial aid commit
ments.
"Stanford's one of the few institutions where
we've had no real increase in net dollars over the
past decade," Denning said. "The net cost of at
tending Stanford, including room and board, has
actually gone down five percent in real dollars
over the last decade."
The Board also heard an update on residential
education from Senior Associate Vice Provost for
Residential Affairs Nadeem Hussain '9O.
"[Hussain] is a ball of fire," Denning said.
"The Board was very enthusiastic about his pres
entation."
Although Denning declined to discuss the ex
act content of Hussain's presentation, he de
scribed a sustained commitment to the residen
tial experience as an essential part of a Stanford
education even as online learning gains traction.
"That residential element is not just where
you live and eat... it's a part of your education,"
Denning said.
Last Sunday afternoon, current and former
members of the Board participated in a naming
ceremony for the new Donald Kennedy Graduate
Residences in Escondido Village. Each of the four
houses within the residence, which is named after
the former president, is named for a different
Stanford provost.
"We thought it was a very appropriate time to
recognize those five leaders in terms of their con
tribution to what Stanford is today," Denning
said.
The Board also heard a presentation from
Lloyd Minor, dean of the School of Medicine, on
the future of Stanford medicine. According to
Denning, Minor focused on
discussing ways of capitaliz
ing on the School of Medi
cine's current position and
means of leading the bio
medical revolution.

Denning subsequently
reviewed several approved
construction plans, including
the replacement of the cur
rent Stanford Stadium lock
er room facilities by a two
story field house (scheduled
for completion by the 2015
season) and the addition of a
parking complex by Roble
(scheduled for completion by
early 2016).
Denning also described
new faculty housing as one of
the more important construc
tion plans for the near fu
ture. The Board approved
building 180 new faculty
housing units on California
Avenue, including 68 single
family units and 108 condo
minium flats, at this month's
meeting. All units will be
available for sale.
"There's been a lot of

thought and effort put into
designing the character of
the adjacent college terrace
area... it's going to offer
some other amenities regard
ing clubhouses and pools,"
Denning said. "It's an at
tempt to provide our faculty
with appropriate housing."

Construction is sched
uled to be completed by the
2017-18 academic year,
pending final approval from
the City of Palo Alto later
this year.
