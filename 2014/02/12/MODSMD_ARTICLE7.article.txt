## ASSU reacts to rise in special fees requests 
### ANDREW VOGELEY DESK EDITOR 
In a long discussion on
Tuesday evening, the 15th
ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate debated how to best ad
just the monetary amount it
had initially recommended be
allocated to special fees
groups.
Groups of senators had
met with special fees groups
over the weekend to tenta
tively recommend disburse
ments to those groups.
"We met with each group
for about 20 minutes and
mainly checked to see if then
budget met the funding re
quirements set by the AS
SU," Senator Ilya
Mouzykantskii 'l6 said. "The
philosophy we've adopted,
mistakenly in my opinion, is
that it is up to the students to
decide if [each group's re
quest] is a legitimate [re
quest], and that we are here

whether or not the request
matches policy."
The Senate had originally
planned to finalize funding
requests by their meeting
last night. However, after
Senate Chair Ben Holston 'l5
was informed by ASSU As
sistant Financial Manager
Stephen Trusheim 'l3 M.S.
'l4 that the total funds re
quested by special fees
groups had increased by
roughly 20 percent over last
year, the vote was postponed
until the Senate could deter
mine away to limit the
amount requested.
This year's initial special
fees requests totaled
$2,610,590. If that amount
were to be approved by the
student body in April in its
entirety, each student's quar
terly activity fee would in
crease to about $l7l, up from
a current fee of $143, accord
ing to the Senate.
"A major flaw in the

process was our communica
tion with Stanford Student
Enterprises (SSE) [the fi
nancial branch of the ASSU].
It's really hard to anticipate
these huge budget increases
and the totals requested,"
said Senator Angela Zhang
'l6, chair of the appropria
tions committee.
Proposed strategies to re
duce special fees requests in
cluded having Holston and
Zhang go through the 62 pro
posals and cut roughly
$500,000 from the cumulative
total. Mouzykantskii offered
a more radical proposal, sug
gesting that the Senate force
every special fees student
group to directly petition the
student body to be placed on
the spring ballot.
Other proposals included
cutting a certain percentage
from each special fees
group's request or cutting
certain special fees line items
entirely. For example, Zhang

suggested that the Senate
limit the amount of money al
lotted for advertising for
events, noting a potential in
crease in e-flyering.
Ultimately, the senators
reached a general consensus
that spending reductions
would be best attained by
calling on student groups to
make voluntary cuts. Follow
ing that step, Holston and
Zhang, with the help of the
other senators, would review
each request to find places
where they could further re
duce spending.
"We are going to go to
some groups directly that re
quested a lot of money and see
what they can cut. We are then
going to get more feedback
from senators [about specific
requests]," Holston said.
While most special fees
groups get on the ballot
through a recommendation
by the Senate, groups can al
so get on the ballot by obtain
ing signatures from 15 per
cent of the student body,
pending approval from the
Elections Commission.
Several senators noted
that the current situation un
derscored the need for the
Student Activities Fee
(SAFE) Reform, which, if ap
proved by the Senate and the
student body, would com
pletely overhaul the funding
process for student groups
and eliminate special fees al
together.
"We've talked a lot about
how our funding system is un
sustainable and how our
funding system is going to
break. Well, this is what hap
pens when the system
breaks," Holston said. "I
want to be clear there are no
villains in this situation but
the fact of the matter is that
the way our funding system is
set up encourages this type of
behavior by student groups."
The Senate also heard an
update from Justine Moore
'l6 and Olivia Moore 'l6
about SAFE Reform, and ap
proved $20,276.52 in general
fees funding.

the fact of the matter is that
the way our funding system is
set up encourages this type of

Requests by special fees groups totaled $2,610,590 this year, 20 percent more than last
year's sum. In response, senators plan to encourage student groups to make voluntary cuts.
In a long discussion on
Tuesday evening, the 15th
ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate debated how to best ad
just the monetary amount it
had initially recommended be
allocated to special fees
groups.
Groups of senators had
met with special fees groups
over the weekend to tenta
tively recommend disburse
ments to those groups.
"We met with each group
for about 20 minutes and
mainly checked to see if then
budget met the funding re
quirements set by the AS
SU," Senator Ilya
Mouzykantskii 'l6 said. "The
philosophy we've adopted,
mistakenly in my opinion, is
that it is up to the students to
decide if [each group's re
quest] is a legitimate [re
quest], and that we are here

whether or not the request
matches policy."
The Senate had originally
planned to finalize funding
requests by their meeting
last night. However, after
Senate Chair Ben Holston 'l5
was informed by ASSU As
sistant Financial Manager
Stephen Trusheim 'l3 M.S.
'l4 that the total funds re
quested by special fees
groups had increased by
roughly 20 percent over last
year, the vote was postponed
until the Senate could deter
mine away to limit the
amount requested.
This year's initial special
fees requests totaled
$2,610,590. If that amount
were to be approved by the
student body in April in its
entirety, each student's quar
terly activity fee would in
crease to about $l7l, up from
a current fee of $143, accord
ing to the Senate.
"A major flaw in the

process was our communica
tion with Stanford Student
Enterprises (SSE) [the fi
nancial branch of the ASSU].
It's really hard to anticipate
these huge budget increases
and the totals requested,"
said Senator Angela Zhang
'l6, chair of the appropria
tions committee.
Proposed strategies to re
duce special fees requests in
cluded having Holston and
Zhang go through the 62 pro
posals and cut roughly
$500,000 from the cumulative
total. Mouzykantskii offered
a more radical proposal, sug
gesting that the Senate force
every special fees student
group to directly petition the
student body to be placed on
the spring ballot.
Other proposals included
cutting a certain percentage
from each special fees
group's request or cutting
certain special fees line items
entirely. For example, Zhang

suggested that the Senate
limit the amount of money al
lotted for advertising for
events, noting a potential in
crease in e-flyering.
Ultimately, the senators
reached a general consensus
that spending reductions
would be best attained by
calling on student groups to
make voluntary cuts. Follow
ing that step, Holston and
Zhang, with the help of the
other senators, would review
each request to find places
where they could further re
duce spending.
"We are going to go to
some groups directly that re
quested a lot of money and see
what they can cut. We are then
going to get more feedback
from senators [about specific
requests]," Holston said.
While most special fees
groups get on the ballot
through a recommendation
by the Senate, groups can al
so get on the ballot by obtain
ing signatures from 15 per
cent of the student body,
pending approval from the
Elections Commission.
