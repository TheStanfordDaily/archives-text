## Fostering change with a proclamation 
### Vignesh Venkataraman 
We live in a world
driven by instant
connections, with
ready access to re
sources previous
generations could only dream of. And
yet, ignorance and hatred continue to
fuel strife and violence all over the
world. Be it religion, culture, caste or
creed, the human race continues to be
its own worst enemy. We like to think
that we've outgrown the mistakes of
our past, that this time around we will
correct injustice before it happens, as
opposed to retroactively applying a
cure to something already diseased.
When you hear about Russia's
emphatically anti-gay policies, includ
ing a bill that prohibits "propaganda
of non-traditional sexual relations to
minors" (whatever that legalese
means in real life, I have no clue), you
start to question exactly how far out
of the Dark Ages society really has
come.

Amidst the backdrop of the Sochi
Winter Olympic games and the
strong homophobic leanings of the
host nation's government, Michael
Sam took one giant step forward and
came out of the closet, making it very
likely that come this fall, he will be
come the first openly gay athlete to
ply his craft in the NFL.
I wish for the day when this kind
of news is not even worth a passing
mention.
Sports have long been home to the
rebels, the forward thinkers, the
pushers of the boundaries of society.
Be it Jackie Robinson in baseball,
Althea Gibson and Arthur Ashe in
tennis, Charles Follis and Fritz Pol
lard in football or Chuck Cooper and
Earl Lloyd in basketball, the univer
sal truth is that sports were among
the first associations in America to in
tegrate, crossing a line that society as
a whole did not redraw for quite some
time. Sports led the charge while so
ciety tagged behind, looking at its
toes while progress marched on by.
Today, sports remain one of Amer
ica's great vices, almost a language
unto themselves. But this addiction to
sports is what makes them so valu
able from the perspective of fostering
change. Folks who couldn't separate
Thrin from Tallahassee can rattle off
box scores of age-old sporting events
from memory, verbatim. This is what
makes them so powerful. Societal
norms, no matter how amoral or in
correct, take significant effort to un
do: think about the decades needed to
abolish slavery, the decades needed to
reverse segregation or the still-ongo
ing battle against racism.
Sports can help redefine norms,
and that is what makes Michael Sam's
bold proclamation so important. We
will not focus on Sam's personal
courage and strength, which are ad
mirable and by themselves worthy of
our praise and support. Selfishly
thinking in terms of the big picture,
this is the first step in what will hope
fully be a quicker path to total and un
questioning acceptance. Football is
the most popular sport in America.
Former Ravens linebacker Brendon
Ayanbadejo said last year that as
many as four players that were in the
league at the time were thinking
about coming out. I hope that this is a
sign of the floodgates opening, that
players will not be judged by their
oiientation but by the athletic gifts
they possess. That people will not be
judged by their sexuality, but by the
content of their character.
In some sense, it can be argued
that LGBT rights are the big-picture
issue of our time, as much as the Civ
il Rights movement was the issue in
the 1960s or foreign policy was in the
1970s. The path we take moving for
ward will define what it means to be a
human being in the not-too-distant
future. I hope and pray that it is a fu
ture that we all can be proud of bar
none.
You go, Michael Sam. You were
the first to take the plunge in football;
time will tell if it is the impetus need
ed to empower change in our world.

I wish for the day

even worth a
