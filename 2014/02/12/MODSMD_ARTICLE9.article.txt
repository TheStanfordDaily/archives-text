# RETURNING HOME

### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
There's just something
about this place. Chuck
Taylor played on Stan
ford football's 1941 na
tional championship
team and later coached the Cardi
nal to a Rose Bowl berth in 1952,
becoming the first person to partic
ipate in "The Granddaddy of Them
All" as both a player and a coach.
Howie Dallmar led the 1942 Cardi
nal basketball team to a national ti
tle and later returned to coach the
team for 21 seasons. Mark Mar
quess was a first-team All-Ameri
can first baseman in 1967 and is re
turning this year for his 38th sea
son as the head coach of Stanford's

baseball program.
The man making his journey
back to The Farm this year
eleven years removed from his sen
ior season is Ryan Garko 'O3. Af
ter getting a call about the job from
departing associate head coach
Dean Stotz, who retired in Septem
ber after 37 seasons at Stanford,
and speaking to Marquess, Garko
had an easy decision to make.
"When Stanford calls and asks
you to be a part of it in any capaci
ty, I don't think you say no," he
said.
Garko's name litters Stanford
baseball's record book, and he cer
tainly knows how to win, having
made the College World Series
(CWS) in each of his four years
with the Cardinal. Over 218 career
games, he is tied for ninth in pro-

gram history with a .350 career
batting average and also tallied 39
HR and 191 RBI on The Farm. Not
to mention his absurd senior sea
son in which he hit .402 becom
ing just the sixth player in school
history to reach that plateau in a

single season with 18 HR and 92
RBI, tied for the most in a single
season.
"He was one of the best hitters
we've ever had here. He's just un
believable. He hit over .400 and had
more home runs (18) than strike
outs (17) [in his senior season],"
said Marquess, who coached Garko

"WHEN STANFORD
CALLS AND ASKS YOU
TO BE PART OF IT IN
ANY CAPACITY, I DON'T
THINK YOU SAY NO."

from 2000-2003. "And I
joked, 'He had no speed, so
he wouldn't get any leg
hits.'"
Still, Garko's Stanford
pride and humility were both
on display as he reminisced
on the Sunken Diamond
bleachers last week. What
made him smile the most
wasn't remembering his .583
career average in the Col
lege World Series, which
earned him a spot on the
CWS Legends Team in 2010.
He only slightly smirked up
on recalling his clutch 2001
postseason performances: a
go-ahead RBI single in the
eighth inning of the Cardi
nal's second elimination
game of the day against
Texas in the regional, a go
ahead RBI single to cap off a
13-11 comeback in the
team's first CWS game
against Tulane and his late
inning solo homers against
Cal State-Fullerton in the
two proceeding CWS games.
What so clearly indicated
Garko's identity as a true
Stanford man was his ear-to
ear grin and chuckle when
he said, "We owned Califor
nia all four years. We always
wanted to win the state."

Returning to Stanford,
this time as an assistant

coach, won't change the stu
dent-mentor relationship be
tween Garko and Marquess,
who was the strongest influ
ence on Garko during his
time as an athlete on The
Farm. Garko cited that rela
tionship and its significance
to him as one of the primary
reasons he chose to return to
his alma mater as a coach.
"The opportunity to come
back and work for Coach
Marquess, who has already
played such a huge role in
my life as a young man
now to learn from him, to
come back to the college
game. If there's someone to
work for, who better? The
guy is a legend."
"He pushes you right to
the edge. Sometimes, he
drives you crazy as a player
here. I was undrafted as a
junior and ended up turning
myself into a good player,
and he had everything to do
with it because he pushed
me. I want him to do the
same thing now and teach
me how to help him win
again."
After Garko went un
drafted despite being named
a Johnny Bench Award
semifinalist and to the All-
Pac-10 team, he said that he
didn't think he would play
professionally. But buying
into Marquess's values his
senior year by selling out for
his team led to a historic sen
ior season.
In June 2003, the Cleve
land Indians selected Garko
with the 11th pick in the
third round of the MLB
Draft. That was the begin
ning of a professional career
that he didn't believe would
happen: one that included

the nation's best collegiate
catcher transitioning to a
first baseman and 463 regu
lar-season major league
games in which he hit .275
with 55 HR and 250 RBI.
♦ ♦♦
Fast forward a few years,
and Garko is back where he
made a name for himself in
baseball. After just four
months on the job, Garko
has already taken to the re
cruiting trail, which will un
doubtedly improve the Car
dinal's recruiting classes in
the years to come. His pas
sion and belief in Mar
quess's program ab
solutely evident after asking
him to reiterate his recruit
ing spiel to play baseball at
Stanford makes him the
perfect person to sell this
school.
And what he emphasized
the most almost to the
point of obsession was
the number of professional
baseball players who played
for the Cardinal and have
still earned a Stanford de
gree. (After Astros All-Star
catcher Jason Castro com
pleted his degree this past
winter, Garko tweeted: "Of
the 57 MLB players to play
for Coach Mark Marquess,
[Castro] is the 49th to earn
his Stanford degree.").
More importantly, having
gone through the experience
of being a student-athlete at
Stanford will allow him to
relate to his players on a
greater personal level.
Garko said that Marquess
tells him that he "still [has] a
lot of player in [him]."
After missing the NCAA
tournament for the first
time since 2009 and just the

fifth time since 1981, anoth
er influence in the locker
room who knows what it's
like to win in the postseason
will definitely have a posi
tive impact on current stu
dent-athletes.
"I'm going to try to never
forget how hard it is to play
this game," he said. "You re
member what it's like to
stand on that field, and it
looks easier being on this
side of it now."
"He brings a lot, not only
on the coaching side, but al
so on the mental side: help
ing us navigate the day-to
day," said junior third base
man Alex Blandino. "He
keeps us focused every day
and pushes us in the right
direction, plays a little good
cop, bad cop. He's good at
giving us some love when we
need it, and a firm fist when
we deserve a kick in the rear
end."
While only time will tell
whether Garko will stay at
Stanford for as long as Mar
quess has, he seems commit
ted to being involved with the
program.
"I have a one-year-old
daughter, and part of the rea
son I took this job was for
her to just grow up around
this place," he said. "I would
do anything for her to go to
school here."
"You're around the
smartest, the hardest-work
ing, the most successful peo
ple in the world. This place
makes you a better person. It
changes your life. This is the
stuff I tell recruits every day.
I was a living example of it."
