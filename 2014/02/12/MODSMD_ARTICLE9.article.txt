### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
There's just something
about this place. Chuck
Taylor played on Stan
ford football's 1941 na
tional championship
team and later coached the Cardi
nal to a Rose Bowl berth in 1952,
becoming the first person to partic
ipate in "The Granddaddy of Them
All" as both a player and a coach.
Howie Dallmar led the 1942 Cardi
nal basketball team to a national ti
tle and later returned to coach the
team for 21 seasons. Mark Mar
quess was a first-team All-Ameri
can first baseman in 1967 and is re
turning this year for his 38th sea
son as the head coach of Stanford's

baseball program.
The man making his journey
back to The Farm this year
eleven years removed from his sen
ior season is Ryan Garko 'O3. Af
ter getting a call about the job from
departing associate head coach
Dean Stotz, who retired in Septem
ber after 37 seasons at Stanford,
and speaking to Marquess, Garko
had an easy decision to make.
"When Stanford calls and asks
you to be a part of it in any capaci
ty, I don't think you say no," he
said.
Garko's name litters Stanford
baseball's record book, and he cer
tainly knows how to win, having
made the College World Series
(CWS) in each of his four years
with the Cardinal. Over 218 career
games, he is tied for ninth in pro-

gram history with a .350 career
batting average and also tallied 39
HR and 191 RBI on The Farm. Not
to mention his absurd senior sea
son in which he hit .402 becom
ing just the sixth player in school
history to reach that plateau in a

single season with 18 HR and 92
RBI, tied for the most in a single
season.
"He was one of the best hitters
we've ever had here. He's just un
believable. He hit over .400 and had
more home runs (18) than strike
outs (17) [in his senior season],"
said Marquess, who coached Garko

"WHEN STANFORD
CALLS AND ASKS YOU
TO BE PART OF IT IN
ANY CAPACITY, I DON'T
THINK YOU SAY NO."
