One hundred days removed from its final fall
tournament, the No. 5 Stanford women's golf
team will finally complete its long winter layoff
this weekend. For the second consecutive year,
Mariah Stackhouse, Lauren Kim and company
will kick off their spring campaign Saturday on
their home course as they play host to the 36-
hole Peg Barnard Invitational.
Many will remember this as Stackhouse's
breakout tournament from last year, when she
set the current Stanford Golf Course record
with a 10-under 61 on the event's final day. Head

coach Anne Walker, however, is not looking so
much for historic rounds in the opener as she is
for continued improvement.
"The players have been working very hard
the past three weeks," Walker said. "Their ef
fort has been on par with our goals for the sea
son. I have seen something in each individual's
game that shows improvement in particular,
Mariko [Tumangan]'s wedge game, Casey
[Danielson's] and Jisoo [Keel]'s swing planes
and Lauren [Kim]'s mental process."
In addition to using the tournament to fine
tune their individual games, the members of

performance, which saw her shoot a record-setting 10-under 61 in the event's final round.
this young Stanford squad
will also be looking to repeat
their performance as team
champions at Peg Barnard,
and for good reason: A win at
this event in 2013 began a
spring season bookended by
the Cardinal's best finish at
the NCAA Championships
since 2007. If all goes as
planned, Peg Barnard will
once again be a springboard
for a successful drive to
NCAAs in Tulsa, Okla.
"We would love to win and
start the season with mo
mentum," Kim commented.
"I think it is always impor
tant to start the season off
well and give ourselves the
confidence we will need by
the end of the season at Pac
12s, Regionals, and hopefully
Nationals. It won't be the
end of the world if we don't
win, but it would be nice to
finish well."
And with the opener on
its home course, the Card
will have every chance to be
gin the spring season in
strong form. The familiarity
with the layout gives Stan
ford a definite advantage
over its opponents, and the
lack of travel means no has
sle with packing or making
flights. Even sleeping in
their own beds can provide a
sense of comfort and continu
ity of routine for the players,
which are of ultimate impor
tance in the days leading up
to the competition. Yet Walk
er's squad realizes that not
everything can or will be
held constant, and factors
such as the weather par
ticularly the area's recent
rain have already altered
their approach.
"The changing speed of
the greens on our course due
to rain and the lack thereof
has proven challenging for
our putting as a team," Kim
said. "As a team, we have
agreed to work on putting
before the weekend. The
fewer strokes we give away
because of small mistakes,
the better chance we have of
winning."
It was just that mastery
of the greens that allowed
Stackhouse to do last year
what no other woman had
done before: shoot 10-under

on the famed Stanford Golf
Course, besting a veritable
pantheon of past Cardinal
golfers that included LPGA
major winners Mickey
Wright and Hilary Lunke.
The then-freshman was mas
terful with her putter that
sunny Sunday afternoon,
sinking a 40-foot eagle on the
par-5 seventh and a 30-foot
birdie two holes later and
nailing three birdies on the
course's five par-3 holes.
With the record-setting
performance came additional
expectations from Walker
not only on Stackhouse, but
also on classmate Kim, who
finished T-sth at her first Peg
Barnard. But while Stack
house and Kim are both
asked to carry their team
more than the average soph
omore would be, they haven't
let the pressure impact their
overall play.
"Coach does a good job of
letting us know she has high
expectations without becom
ing overbearing," Kim said.
"I definitely appreciate the

way she holds us to high
standards because it shows
she believes in us and our
abilities both as golfers and
as individuals. I've noticed
that sometimes I become my
own enemy and it helps to
have someone like Coach
and Mai'iah in my case
who push me to be my best
and remind me to believe in
myself."
In order to repeat at
home, however, Stanford will
need more than solid play out
of its sophomores. Junior
Mariko Tumangan, the old
est player in Walker's fall
tournament lineups, will
have to improve on her 6-
over 148 cumulative score at
this event in 2013 if the Car
dinal is to defeat Pac-12 oppo
nents No. 17 Oregon and No.
26 Cal at this year's iteration
of Peg Barnard.
Freshmen Casey Daniel
son and Quirine Eijkenboom
will also receive the chance to
better their scores from the
Stanford Intercollegiate a
few months ago, in which nei

ther player broke par for a
round. Seniors Marissa Mar
and Danielle Frasier, who will
play as individuals, are look
ing to work themselves back
into the team's top five, a po
sition both have held at one
point in their collegiate ca
reers.

since 2007. If all goes as
planned, Peg Barnard will
once again be a springboard
for a successful drive to
NCAAs in Tulsa, Okla.
"We would love to win and
start the season with mo
mentum," Kim commented.
"I think it is always impor
tant to start the season off
well and give ourselves the
confidence we will need by
the end of the season at Pac
12s, Regionals, and hopefully
Nationals. It won't be the
end of the world if we don't
win, but it would be nice to
finish well."
And with the opener on
its home course, the Card
will have every chance to be
gin the spring season in
strong form. The familiarity
with the layout gives Stan
ford a definite advantage
over its opponents, and the
lack of travel means no has
sle with packing or making
flights. Even sleeping in
their own beds can provide a
sense of comfort and continu
ity of routine for the players,
which are of ultimate impor
tance in the days leading up
to the competition. Yet Walk
er's squad realizes that not
everything can or will be
held constant, and factors
such as the weather par
ticularly the area's recent
rain have already altered
their approach.
"The changing speed of
the greens on our course due
to rain and the lack thereof
has proven challenging for
our putting as a team," Kim
said. "As a team, we have
agreed to work on putting
before the weekend. The
fewer strokes we give away
because of small mistakes,
the better chance we have of
winning."
It was just that mastery
of the greens that allowed
Stackhouse to do last year
what no other woman had
done before: shoot 10-under

on the famed Stanford Golf
Course, besting a veritable
pantheon of past Cardinal
golfers that included LPGA
major winners Mickey
Wright and Hilary Lunke.
The then-freshman was mas
terful with her putter that
sunny Sunday afternoon,
sinking a 40-foot eagle on the
par-5 seventh and a 30-foot
birdie two holes later and
nailing three birdies on the
course's five par-3 holes.
With the record-setting
performance came additional
expectations from Walker
not only on Stackhouse, but
also on classmate Kim, who
finished T-sth at her first Peg
Barnard. But while Stack
house and Kim are both
asked to carry their team
more than the average soph
omore would be, they haven't
let the pressure impact their
overall play.
"Coach does a good job of
letting us know she has high
expectations without becom
ing overbearing," Kim said.
"I definitely appreciate the

way she holds us to high
standards because it shows
she believes in us and our
abilities both as golfers and
as individuals. I've noticed
that sometimes I become my
own enemy and it helps to
have someone like Coach
and Mai'iah in my case
who push me to be my best
and remind me to believe in
myself."
In order to repeat at
home, however, Stanford will
need more than solid play out
of its sophomores. Junior
Mariko Tumangan, the old
est player in Walker's fall
tournament lineups, will
have to improve on her 6-
over 148 cumulative score at
this event in 2013 if the Car
dinal is to defeat Pac-12 oppo
nents No. 17 Oregon and No.
26 Cal at this year's iteration
of Peg Barnard.
Freshmen Casey Daniel
son and Quirine Eijkenboom
will also receive the chance to
better their scores from the
Stanford Intercollegiate a
few months ago, in which nei

ther player broke par for a
round. Seniors Marissa Mar
and Danielle Frasier, who will
play as individuals, are look
ing to work themselves back
into the team's top five, a po
sition both have held at one
point in their collegiate ca
reers.

One hundred days removed from its final fall
tournament, the No. 5 Stanford women's golf
team will finally complete its long winter layoff
this weekend. For the second consecutive year,
Mariah Stackhouse, Lauren Kim and company
will kick off their spring campaign Saturday on
their home course as they play host to the 36-
hole Peg Barnard Invitational.
Many will remember this as Stackhouse's
breakout tournament from last year, when she
set the current Stanford Golf Course record
with a 10-under 61 on the event's final day. Head

coach Anne Walker, however, is not looking so
much for historic rounds in the opener as she is
for continued improvement.
"The players have been working very hard
the past three weeks," Walker said. "Their ef
fort has been on par with our goals for the sea
son. I have seen something in each individual's
game that shows improvement in particular,
Mariko [Tumangan]'s wedge game, Casey
[Danielson's] and Jisoo [Keel]'s swing planes
and Lauren [Kim]'s mental process."
In addition to using the tournament to fine
tune their individual games, the members of
