their home course as they play host to the 36-

breakout tournament from last year, when she
set the current Stanford Golf Course record
with a 10-under 61 on the event's final day. Head

coach Anne Walker, however, is not looking so

game that shows improvement in particular,
Mariko [Tumangan]'s wedge game, Casey
[Danielson's] and Jisoo [Keel]'s swing planes
and Lauren [Kim]'s mental process."
In addition to using the tournament to fine
