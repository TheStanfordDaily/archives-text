### DYLAN FUGEL STAFF WRITER 
No. 2 Stanford Women's Water Polo (5-0,0-
0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) contin
ued its excellent start to the season on
Wednesday, beating No. 16 UC-Santa Clara (3-
5, 0-0 Golden Coast Conference) 14-6 in what
was a comfortable victory. The game was
played at Sullivan Aquatic Center in Santa
Clara, Calif., and formed part of the Broncos'
"green" initiative, as both teams took many en
ergy-saving measures in order to reduce the
carbon footprint of the game.

2/12, Santa Clara, Calif.
Stanford started the match well, taking an
early three-goal lead with two goals from senior
Annika Dries and another tally by freshman
Dani Jackovich, who has had a very fruitful start
to her Stanford career thus far. Dries would fin
ish the game with a hat trick, while Jackovich
added another goal in the third period.
The teams would then trade goals for the
rest of the period, with scores by the Broncos'
sophomore drivers Erin Sheridan and Eliza
beth Anderson being matched by Cardinal
sophomore driver Anna Yelizarova and junior
two-meter Ashley Grossman. The period end
ed 5-3 with the Cardinal ahead, which was
about the extent that the Broncos really chal
lenged Stanford before the game was broken
open.
Anderson converted a penalty shot in order
to tighten the game up at 5-4, but the Cardinal
scored three unanswered from Grossman,
sophomore driver Maggie Steffens and fresh
man Julia Hermann to build a solid 8-4 advan
tage. The rest of the contest went Stanford's
way, leading to the comfortable final score line,
with Grossman completing a hat trick and
Hermann, Jackovich and Yelizarova all picking
up one more score apiece. Freshman Jamie
Neushul netted the remaining goal.
Overall, Stanford will be pleased with its
quality of play after recording another victory
over a ranked opponent to extend its perfect
start to the season. The outcome of the match
was almost never in doubt, apart from a few
moments of early jitters in the first period.
The Card is beginning to look like a force to be
reckoned with in the loaded MPSF.
Stanford will now turn its attention to the
weekend's slate of away games, which will fea
ture a Saturday doubleheader as the Cardinal
travels east to face the unranked Pacific Tigers
