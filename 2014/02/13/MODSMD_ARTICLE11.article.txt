## Stanford routs Santa Clara on the road Card to play Pacific and UC-Davis in Saturday doubleheader 
### DYLAN FUGEL STAFF WRITER 
No. 2 Stanford Women's Water Polo (5-0,0-
0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) contin
ued its excellent start to the season on
Wednesday, beating No. 16 UC-Santa Clara (3-
5, 0-0 Golden Coast Conference) 14-6 in what
was a comfortable victory. The game was
played at Sullivan Aquatic Center in Santa
Clara, Calif., and formed part of the Broncos'
"green" initiative, as both teams took many en
ergy-saving measures in order to reduce the
carbon footprint of the game.

2/12, Santa Clara, Calif.
Stanford started the match well, taking an
early three-goal lead with two goals from senior
Annika Dries and another tally by freshman
Dani Jackovich, who has had a very fruitful start
to her Stanford career thus far. Dries would fin
ish the game with a hat trick, while Jackovich
added another goal in the third period.
The teams would then trade goals for the
rest of the period, with scores by the Broncos'
sophomore drivers Erin Sheridan and Eliza
beth Anderson being matched by Cardinal
sophomore driver Anna Yelizarova and junior
two-meter Ashley Grossman. The period end
ed 5-3 with the Cardinal ahead, which was
about the extent that the Broncos really chal
lenged Stanford before the game was broken
open.
Anderson converted a penalty shot in order
to tighten the game up at 5-4, but the Cardinal
scored three unanswered from Grossman,
sophomore driver Maggie Steffens and fresh
man Julia Hermann to build a solid 8-4 advan
tage. The rest of the contest went Stanford's
way, leading to the comfortable final score line,
with Grossman completing a hat trick and
Hermann, Jackovich and Yelizarova all picking
up one more score apiece. Freshman Jamie
Neushul netted the remaining goal.
Overall, Stanford will be pleased with its
quality of play after recording another victory
over a ranked opponent to extend its perfect
start to the season. The outcome of the match
was almost never in doubt, apart from a few
moments of early jitters in the first period.
The Card is beginning to look like a force to be
reckoned with in the loaded MPSF.
Stanford will now turn its attention to the
weekend's slate of away games, which will fea
ture a Saturday doubleheader as the Cardinal
travels east to face the unranked Pacific Tigers

before it heads north to take
on the No. 14 UC-Davis Ag
gies. The Cardinal will be
fairly confident going into
both games, considering the
fact that Pacific is unranked
and that it beat UC-Davis 16-
3 in the first game of the sea
son during the group stages
of the Stanford Invitational.
In that game, Yelizarova
notched her first hat trick of
the season while junior driv
er Kiley Neushul had an im
pressive five goals, kicking
off a stellar run of play that
helped her net the MPSF
Player of the Week award.
That same game was also no
table for freshman defender
Sophia Monaghan, who
notched her first collegiate
goal.
Pacific (4-6, 0-0 Golden
Coast Conference) has en
dured a tough start to the
season, as it has lost all of its
matchups against ranked op
ponents. It played No. 3
UCLA close, losing 12-6, and
barely fell to No. 19
Hartwick 10-9. However, it
has not played a home game
all season, and the crowd in
Stockton will surely be hop
ing to see an upset when the
Cardinal visits on Saturday.
The Tigers are led by jun
ior utility players Taylor
Adair and Byrdie Pye, both of
whom averaged over one and

a half goals per contest last
season. However, their team
should pose no significant
threat to Stanford, which has
run roughshod over its early
season schedule.
A more difficult test will
come in the latter of the
day's two games, when the
Cardinal takes on the No. 14
Aggies. The Aggies (5-5, 0-0
Big West) have already
notched some impressive
wins for the season, includ
ing over No. 13 Indiana, No.
16 UC-Santa Barbara and

then-No. 20 Michigan. At the
Stanford Invitational, they
finished 1-3, playing then-
No. 6 Hawaii close before
losing 9-8 and picking up 7th
place with a 9-5 victory over
Michigan. They are led by
junior attacker Keelia Hous
ton and sophomore center
Allyson Hansen. In only
their second home game of
the season, they will also
look to take out Stanford in
what should be a fiercely
contested matchup.
Overall, it will be a gruel

ing weekend for the Cardi
nal, playing two games in a
span of several hours. How
ever, the team will expect
nothing less than two wins,
as it hopes to improve its
record to a perfect 7-0 on the
season. The trip marks the
start of a 10-game away slate
for the Cardinal, which does
not return to the Avery
Aquatic Center until March
30 against No. 1 USC.
