## Ten Years of Kanye 
### Uttara Sivaram 
Tuesday marked the 10th an
niversary of Kanye West's
enormously successful studio
album, The College Dropout. In
deed, the occasion may have been
even more momentous than West's
own birthday in June, which he
spent with Beyonce, Scott Disick,
his Maybach and a birthday cake
that allegedly had a net cost of
about $l3 million.
The hip-hop artist, songwriter,
fashion designer, producer, film di
rector, entrepreneur, philanthropist
and self-titled musical "scholar" has
had quite the decade, spent square
ly in the media's crosshairs as he
discovered new and exciting ways
of shocking the general public
and picking up 21 Grammys and a
few misdemeanors along the way. It
isn't enough to simply say that con
troversy has followed Mr. West
Kanye has invited media attention
to his (very ornate) front door, from
calling George W Bush racist on TV
to comparing himself to a war vet
eran.
But on Tuesday, we put these
(mostly) minor speed bumps in the
greater context of Kanye's highly
acclaimed body of work, a collection
that has inspired some of the most
insightful conversations about race
relations, class struggle, violence
and drug culture in the U.S. On
Tuesday, we asked, among many
things, "What can we learn from
Kanye West?"
The great ancient Chinese mili
tary expert, Sun Tzu, wisely said,
"Know your enemy and know your
self, and you can fight a thousand
battles." Kanye says, just as wisely,
"Believe in your flyness, and con
quer your shyness."
From Kanye, we can learn confi
dence boundless and bullish con
fidence, undiminished by the harsh
est of spotlights and the most un
forgiving of critics. On the one
hand, West's audacity is overt and
gaudy; on the other, he is brooding
and vulnerable â€”he unblushingly
reveals the very best and the very
worst of himself because ultimately,
he loves himself.
Kanye deeply, unconditionally
and profoundly adores Kanye. As a
result, his songs are no longer sub
ject to market forces or media cri
tique. Perhaps they never were.
Everything West creates is so gen
uinely loved and cherished by him
self that metrics of popular "suc
cess" and "failure" become irrele
vant. "Now I could let these dream
killers kill my self-esteem," West
raps, "or use my arrogance as the
steam to power my dreams."
From Kanye, we can learn how
to be different, and to be better at
being different. Every day, we grow
physically intellectually, person
ally but only within certain
boundaries: the structures we live
within. Standards have been set,
and we funnel through our talents
with these standards as our rails,
much like the ones they put up in
bowling alleys to ensure the ball
never rolls astray. And instead of
changing these standards, we
change ourselves.
From College Dropout to
808's & Heartbreak, and, most
recently, to the often grating, collec
tive tune of Yeezus, Kanye has
carved out a niche for his work in
the midst of an increasingly pre
dictable hip-hop universe. Like
Kanye, we can learn how to not sim
ply find a place in the world but

make a place in the world and to
forge that place from the very
essence of what makes us great.
From Kanye, we've learned the
devastating price of hubris. We've
watched how a brilliant artist has
been unceremoniously knocked
from his pedestal, destined to spend
his future displayed on the home
page of Jezebel by merely believ
ing in his own perfection. "He that
is proud eats up himself," said
Shakespeare. "Pride is his own
glass, his own trumpet, his own
chronicle." Kanye, self-proclaimed
as both a modern Shakespeare and
the next Steve Jobs, proclaims,
"You all want me to be great, but
don't want me to say I'm great?!"
Unfortunately, Kanye, yes; you
and Richard Sherman have the un
fortunate burden of brilliance with
out humility. And because of this,
Kanye will never learn. It's as if
The Kanye West genre (TM)
evolves without him, changing sty
listically but never substantially.
See, there's a real value in honest
self-critique, and it's lacking in
Kanye's entire body of work. And
because Kanye never looks back,
Kanye never moves forward.
Kanye will continue to make
beautiful songs and party with Bey
once and buy luxury cars, but he
will never truly know his greatness,
for he will never understand the
context in which he is great. As a re
sult, he is stuck, a maladaptive
character in his own book, who
"wouldn't change by the change, or
the game, or the fame, when he
came, in the game, he made his own
name." Kanye is bound to his own
dark, twisted fantasy, exceptional
and alone.
We can learn quite a bit from
Kanye West. You wouldn't really be
lieve it from his interviews and ra
dio talks, where he usually rambles
about Chicago and Kim Kardashian
and why exactly he thinks he's Je
sus. But on Tuesday, we had a
chance to remember the Kanye that
had away of expressing pride and
pain in the same verse, the Kanye
that made us laugh with his puns,
the Kanye that changed the game
by merely being in it.
Happy 10th anniversary to you,
Kanye. Thank you for giving more
and more of yourself to us every
year. Thank you for allowing us to
hate you publicly and love you pri
vately. Thank you for marrying
the only woman who would put you
in the media more than you al
ready are. Thank you for naming
your daughter something as ab
surd as a compass direction.
Thank you for being Kanye West,
because in truth, none of us would
have the courage to rise so high and
fall so far.
