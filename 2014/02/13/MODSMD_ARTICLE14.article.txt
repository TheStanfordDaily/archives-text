# European Modernity: Tragedy, then Farce
## 
### James Bradbury 
A prominent Stanford professor
(whom I won't name because
he wasn't speaking to be quot
ed) was only repeating the consensus
among the political and economic
elite when he told me after a talk on
Monday that, simply because Eu
rope was the first to modernize, mod
ernization will always and every
where involve Westernization.
His point was that China, if it is to
become a modern superpower, has
no other option than to follow what
its leaders used to condemn as the
"capitalist road." More specifically,
he said that China's large and inde
pendent state-owned enterprises
whose profits largely support the re
maining collective welfare infrastruc
ture for workers, retirees and their
families, rather than accruing to the
state treasury—are in some objec
tive sense "no longer acceptable":
They neither prop up the national
budget nor enable rapid consumer
driven growth like more efficient pri
vate companies.
Never mind that many Western
state enterprises aren't especially
profitable for their respective govern
ments either, or that Germany, the ab
solute core of the European West,

continues to defy foreign economists'
advice to shift its export-driven econ
omy more towards domestic con
sumers. In the Western view, China is
holding on to an un-Western econom
ic institution and it must get rid of it
to be deemed truly "modern."
He was, of course, right. Moder
nity is Western. The institutions that
comprise modernity, from the nation
state and parliamentary democracy
to the stock exchange and corpora
tions, began as Western innovations
and were spread, first by overt colo
nialism and then by simple economic
dominance, to "the uttermost ends of
the earth."
The West's ongoing imposition of
European modernity on the world
does not really distinguish between
pre-modern cultural and economic
institutions, like family and clan
based social insurance, and alterna
tive modernities like collective farms
or the state-owned enterprises I
mentioned: Both are swept away.
Those of us who idealistically insist
(though it really is a conservative
impulse) that countries like China
can and should forge independent
paths which preserve their unique
mixtures of traditional, Western and
alternative institutions are up
against that onslaught, and our victo
ries are always at best both tempo
rary and conditional.
But isn't it unfair to blame Eu
rope for the continued influence of
the Western conception of moderni
ty? Hasn't the continent been, as it
were, defanged through decoloniza
tion and demobilization, and hasn't it
even itself adopted institutional mix
tures like social democracy?
There is indeed a new Europe.
The founding of the European Union
as the European Coal and Steel
Community designed to make an
other European World War a physi
cal impossibility replaced the
modern concept of the nation-state
with a new kind of supranational au
thority. The European Commission
the EU's unelected executive
branch similarly replaced the
modern institution of parliamentary
democracy with a more complex
technocratic ideal.
The whole new European system
goes to great lengths, often in aggra
vating ways, to appear as non-ideo
logical as possible: Every decision
and regulation is couched in the lan
guage of utilitarian cost-benefit
analysis (when the language makes
sense at all: The EU itself released a
66-page document detailing the ways
in which words used in EU docu
ments do not mean the things they
do in other contexts).
Of course, this claim of non-ideol
ogy is a fagade: It can only be ideolo

gy that motivates the EU to (for ex
ample) take a strong, science-based
position on climate change at the
same time as a deeply unscientific
policy stance against all GMOs.
This is the reality of Europe
which Ukraine and Tbrkey peren
nially almost-European have
wrestled with for years. Ukraine has
been equally poorly served by the
Russian-aligned President Viktor
Yanukovych and his Europe-aligned
but infighting predecessors Presi
dent Viktor Yushchenko and Prime
Minister Yulia Tymoshenko not to
mention the series of corrupt gov
ernments which preceded them or
the present opposition leaders, each
of whom are less well liked than
Yanukovych.
For Ukraine, then, Russia and
Europe, who have both extended
loan offers to help shore up the coun
try's budget, represent limited eco
nomic lifelines but not a solution to
governance problems. The protesters
in Ukraine's Euromaidan move
ment want functioning institutions of
Western modernity and more demo
cratic and national sovereignty not
the loss of all three that EU member
ship ultimately promises.
At Europe's other border —with
the Arab world, rather than the
Russian bloc Turkey under Prime
Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo?an be
lieves that, while maintaining a large
ly pro-European foreign policy out
look and adopting at its own pace as
pects of EU law and policy it consid
ers helpful, the country can forge an
independent development path: one
that (among other things) allows for
the successful integration of Islamist
politics and democratic elections.
Most discourse on EU relations
and accession, including that which
concerns Ibrkey and Ukraine, focus
es on the economic incentives sur
rounding the European free trade
zone and shared currency, as well as
the effects of specific policies like the
free flow of immigrants. But the
most fundamental right a country
gives up when it joins the EU isn't
economic or even political sovereign
ty it's the right to experiment with
differing conceptions of modernity
and development, to define for itself
what those words should really
mean.
With that in mind, the European
Union project is a necessary frame
work for Europe as it embarks on its
long path of reconciliation with its
many historical and social demons. It
is not a new modernity to be export
ed with the same impunity as the
last.
