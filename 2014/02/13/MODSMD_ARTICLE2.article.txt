# Mayer soars to tech policy stardom
## Graduate students work on online privacy elicits media, regulatory interest 
### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
From serving as a consultant to
law enforcement to collaborating
with Firefox on a cookie-blocking
feature, Jonathan Mayer J.D. 'l2
Ph.D. 'l6 has made a name for him
self in recent years with regards to
technology policy and online priva
cy issues.
Despite being recently named
as one of Forbes Magazine's "Top
30 Under 30," however, Mayer
framed the public plaudits as sim
ply away to ensure that his work
continues to influence public debate
well into the future, noting that
even being considered for the
Forbes nomination had been a sur
prising if entirely positive ex
perience.
"It's one of those things where
you don't really ask for it or expect
it, but it's really nice to get it," he
said.
A native of Chicago, Mayer
earned his undergraduate degree
in public policy from Princeton Uni
versity in 2009 and came directly to
Stanford with the intent of complet
ing the first ever J.D./Ph.D. in com
puter science (CS).

"l wasn't going to do law and
policy lite or CS-lite I was going
full in on both," he reflected. "I ap
plied to both programs at Stanford,
without really asking about it in ad
vance or knowing if it was possible.
I'd read something that suggested
it was okay, but I intentionally

avoided asking questions."
Even while working towards his
law degree, Mayer split time be
tween Law School classes and CS
research.
"Some days it [was] very chal
lenging," he said. "I'd be walking
from corporate lectures to CS re

search. Thankfully the areas I was
interested in were of interest to
both law professors and the CS de
partment. I was able to do the stuff
I wanted, which happened to have
law and CS together."
His research in tech policy, an
area that Mayer describes as "the
ACLU [American Civil Liberties
Union] for technology," has led him
to work on issues related to
Google's cookie-tracking policy on
line, phone metadata privacy and
the NSA's international tracking,
among others. He framed his inter
est in those fields as reflective of
not only personal curiosity but also
a desire to educate the public about
how their data is used.
In fact, Mayer began looking in
to cookie tracking at about the
same time that the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) began their in
vestigation into Google. The FTC
acknowledged looking at Mayer's
research throughout their investi
gation, which eventually resulted in
a $22.5 million fine for the Silicon
Valley giant.
Mayer framed the cookie-track
ing issue as presenting significant
implications for the general popula
tion.

"When you go to a website on
your computer, a cookie is set,
which is just a little bit of text, with
a unique ID number, that can follow
you to another website that you go
to, so that someone could know that
you were the same person who
looked at both websites," Mayer
said. "Apple tries to prevent that
cookie sending, but there's a weird
quirk in Safari where you could
send the cookie anyways. Google
took advantage of this quirk in Sa
fari to ensure that the cookie got
sent from the first website [so they
could track your movements]."
Patrick Mutchler Ph.D. 'l6,
whose research interests involve
mobile security, began working
with Mayer this past summer on
the phone metadata privacy re
search.
"[Mayer] is a unique researcher
because having a J.D. with a Ph.D.
gives him some expertise that few
people have, even at Stanford,"
Mutchler said. "He's working on
things that have an obvious direct
influence on people, which is not
something you see as a researcher.
It's harder to come up with things

Jonathan Mayer J.D. '12 Ph.D. '16 framed his work on privacy issues as
a necessary balance to existing information asymmetries, a problem that
he described as exacerbated by a lack of nuance in media coverage.
that have a direct influence
right away.
For Mutchler, the most
unexpected part about work
ing with Mayer was the
practice of publishing their
preliminary results on May
er's blog, which is followed
by various news media.
"It got picked up by the
media and it was weird to
see them not reporting the
information correctly," he
said. "You could see how
they could get it wrong, but
it was still wrong, and that
was hard."
For Mayer, one of the

hardest parts of trying to
push back against technolo
gy giants like Google is see
ing the limited impact of his
information and research on
policy debates.
"The person with the
largest megaphone or great
est notoriety has the great
est sway, not the person with
the best facts or correct un
derstanding of technology or
law... there's no real way to
correct that," he said. "I think
I've been fortunate to have an
impact but I only have such a
large megaphone."
Mayer also expressed
frustration with the media's
lack of nuance, an issue
particularly pronounced in
recent investigations into
the National Security
Agency's information-gath

ering practices.
"Let's suppose the NSA
did follow the rules," he said.
"Did those rules make
sense? No. I think that's
more relevant and a more
persuasive argument, but
it's not always the best way
to move the debate... Jour
nalists get mad at me be
cause they want me to [say]
'screw the NSA,' but I'm not
going to say it I disagree
and talk about the things
they've done wrong."
For Mayer, the need to
function as a pseudo-ACLU
for technology issues is sym
bolized by the enormous
asymmetric exchange of infor
mation in the tech industry.
"I've been involved in law
policy and CS work because
it brings clarity to the impact

of certain practices," he said.
"People should know that the
NSA phone policy, which
looks at how closely connect
ed phone calls are, claims to
have no names involved, yet
a quick study and search
through Yelp and Google and
Facebook showed that we
could identify over 90 per
cent of the numbers we were
looking at."

"I don't think an ordi
nary member of the public
could be expecting to have
that kind of intuition about
it, so this space provides the
essential information," he
added. "Who else is going to
do it, but those in acade
mia?"
