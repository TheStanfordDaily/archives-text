## Researchers refine cancer identification 
### CHRISTINA GIBBS 
A team of Stanford researchers
has developed an instrument that
could improve the success rate of
stomach cancer surgery by better
differentiating between cancerous
and healthy cells.
The research team led by
Livia Eberlin, a postdoctoral fellow
in chemistry, and Richard Zare,
chair of the Department of Chem
istry and Eberlin's advisor em
ployed mass spectrometry to more
accurately assess the health of cells
in surgically removed stomach tis
sue, presenting the potential for re
duced surgery return rates.
Under current surgical proce
dures, the surgeon will remove tis
sue that he or she believes to be
cancerous before sending the ex
tracted sample to a pathologist.
The pathologist then identifies the
margins, or healthy edges, of the re
maining tissue, albeit due to the
20 to 30 percent chance of a diagno
sis error —while potentially leaving
some tumorous cells behind.
"Finding the margins is really
important in surgery... [patholo
gists] want the margins to be clear
of cancer," Eberlin said. "[lt] is re
ally hard to say if there's cancer
there or not."
By contrast, mass spectrome
try involves turning molecules into
charged particles and sending
them down a vacuum tube. By
measuring the amount of time it
takes for each molecule to reach
the end of the tube, the machine
generates an image with thou
sands of peaks, each of which rep
resents the abundance of a differ
ent chemical in the sample and
thus reflects cell health.

In addition to Eberlin and Zare,
the research team also included As
sistant Professor of Surgery
George Poultsides M.S. 'll and Pro
fessor of Health Research and Poli
cy Robert Tibshirani M.S. 'B3 Ph.D.
'B5.
Poultsides emphasized that all
members of the team had been vital
to the technique's development, de
spite their disparate backgrounds.
"It was a risk," Poultsides said.
"It was a collaboration between re
searchers who do not speak the
same language a risk that paid
off."
Although most scientific re
search remains confined to a specif
ic field, Poultsides framed the
team's output as reflective of the
broader importance of bridging
disciplines, particularly between
clinicians and researchers.
"Clinicians and researchers are
in their own silo," Poultsides said.
"It's hard to move between disci
plines, but Stanford is an institu
tion where collaboration is encour
aged. I felt it was very easy to work
with chemists and a statistician."
Even so, the team initially
struggled to identify funding for
the study, according to Poultsides.
They eventually won support from
the Stanford Hospital and Clinics
Cancer Innovation Fund.
Team members said that they
hope to introduce their instrument
to pathologists on a clinical level in
around a decade. In the interim,
they will work to make the product
more user-friendly while also test
ing it on a larger sample of cancer
patients to refine its accuracy.
