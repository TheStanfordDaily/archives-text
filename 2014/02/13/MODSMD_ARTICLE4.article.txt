# NEWS BRIEF
## University issues apology for AlertSU midnight calls 
### â€“ Madeleine Han 
A trio of a delayed phone all
clear message regarding Tues
day's evacuation of Tresidder
Memorial Union, a malfunction
ing steam valve at the Cardinal
Cogen facility and a series of
AMBER Alerts awoke the Stan
ford community early Wednes

day morning.
Mission Mode, the third-party
alert system vendor behind the
AlertSU program, experienced a
delay of over 12 hours in issuing
an "all-clear" notification re
garding reports of a suspicious
backpack at Tresidder. Around
half of the campus community
received the late-night message.
"Stanford never intended
phone alerts to be issues during
overnight hours," wrote Univer
sity administrators in an ex
planatory email to the Universi

ty population.
According to University
spokeswoman Lisa Lapin, Stan
ford has asked Mission Mode to
upgrade the standard platforms
they use specifically for Stanford
because the system has experi
enced delays in the past.
She added that Stanford con
tacted Mission Mode early
Wednesday morning to prevent
calls from going through to the
other 50 percent of Stanford's
population.
A non-threatening release of

steam at the Cardinal Cogen fa
cility and a series of govern
ment-issued AMBER Alerts
capped off what Lapin referred
to as an "unfortunate confluence
of events."
"We apologize for ... the dis
ruption created for many individu
als," the University email added.
"We are working to develop the
most efficient systems possible to
provide timely notifications to our
University community."
