## Fellowship numbers on the rise Record number of students win Chappell-Lougee giants 
### VANESSA OCHAVILLO DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Thirty-eight students have been
named as this year's recipients of
the Chappell-Lougee Fellowship,
which awards up to $6,000 to sopho
mores pursuing a summer research
project in the humanities or social
sciences.
The number of grants awarded
this year is the highest since the
grant's inception in 1982 and sev
en more than last year's sum. The
number of completed applications
also rose from last year, from 45 to
67.
UAR's contribution
Fellowship coordinator Christina
Mesa 'B2 Ph.D. '99 attributed the in
creased interest in part to outreach
by Undergraduate Advising and Re
search (UAR) academic directors,
who hosted more information ses
sions than in previous years and
have more experience with the
grant process.
"I think that our interactions
with them [the students] are a lot
about writing the proposal now," she
said.
While UAR's 12 academic direc
tors are all trained to help students
work on their Chappell-Lougee ap
plication, Mesa noted that individual
directors will often redirect stu
dents with specific interests to an
other director with expertise in a re
lated discipline.
For example, students pursuing
an anthropology project are sent to
Wilbur Hall's Cari Kapur M.A. '99
Ph.D. 'O5. At the same time,
prospective applicants interested in
creative writing a popular choice
among students are sent to Flo
rence Moore Hall's Melissa Steven
son '96.
Increased interest
This year's awards will support
projects ranging from studying
modernization in China and Korea
to conducting ethnography of tailors
in Italy. While fellowship coordina
tors requested additional funding
from UAR to meet the increase in
demand, however, Mesa not
ed that the selection commit
tee had had to make an un
precedented number of cuts.

"I don't think any of the
applications were particular
ly weak," Mesa said. "There
were just so many and we
had to fund the most viable.
Sometimes the best ideas
need more work or narrow
ing down."
While several students
were given the chance to re
submit their proposals with
suggested revisions, some
chose not to. Former schol
ars emphasized, however,
that the invitation to make
suggested revisions should
not discourage applicants.
"It's a 'yes' in disguise,"
said Mailyn Fidler 'l4.
