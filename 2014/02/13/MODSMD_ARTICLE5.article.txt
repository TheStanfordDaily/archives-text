## Fellowship numbers on the rise Record number of students win Chappell-Lougee giants 
### VANESSA OCHAVILLO DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Thirty-eight students have been
named as this year's recipients of
the Chappell-Lougee Fellowship,
which awards up to $6,000 to sopho

The number of grants awarded
this year is the highest since the
grant's inception in 1982 and sev

about writing the proposal now," she
said.

work on their Chappell-Lougee ap
plication, Mesa noted that individual
directors will often redirect stu

other director with expertise in a re

prospective applicants interested in
creative writing a popular choice
among students are sent to Flo
rence Moore Hall's Melissa Steven
son '96.
Increased interest
This year's awards will support

modernization in China and Korea
to conducting ethnography of tailors
