## Exploring why we storm the field 
### Do-Hyoung Pork 
Last night, I watched fren
zied fans storm the court
after Wyoming toppled
No. 5 San Diego State at
home. It was actually a
pretty impressive court storming, giv
en that it took place in the bustling
metropolis that is Laramie, Wyo. after
a game between two teams with rea
sonably small Mowings.
The scene just served to remind
me of a sad truth: I haven't had the
opportunity to storm the field with fel
low Cardinal fans, despite my three
opportunities to do so thus far during
my time on The Farm.
During the 2012 USC game, I had
n't yet moved into my freshman dorm
and thus had more pressing issues to
deal with than a football team that I'd
never seen before. During the 2012
Pac-12 Championship, I had to leave
the game after the first half to play an
orchestra concert (I know, I know...)
and experienced the field storming
only through the rabidly enthusiastic
texts that I received from my friends
during the intermission of the concert.
And for 2013 Oregon, I was up in the
press box watching the fervor from
high above the field.
Three field stormings in two
years, admittedly, does seem like a
fairly high number for the fan base of
a team that counts itself amongst the
nation's elite. And I know that Stan
ford fans' propensity to storm the
field often has sometimes drawn the
ire of many other fan bases around
the Pac-12.
But should Stanford fans care? I
don't think so.

The storming of the field in foot
ball or the storming of the court in
basketball is just a physical manifesta
tion of the overwhelming emotional
release following a game. More often
than not, that emotional release stems
from an invigorating upset of a top
five or top-10 team.
It is based on this reasoning that
people criticize Stanford fans for
storming the field against Oregon last
season. Critics argue that a defeat of
the No. 3 team by the No. 5 team in
the country is not even an upset, per
se, much less one worthy of a field
storming. They argue that storming
the field in such a scenario implies
that Stanford's fans haven't yet em
braced the idea that they follow an
elite program that should be expected
to win every game.
But why should an upset be the on
ly thing that can warrant an emotional
outpouring on the scale of a field
storming? Where were all of the critics
when fans of No. 5 Auburn stormed
the field after beating No. 1 Alabama?
By the same argument from above,
that shouldn't even have been so
much of an upset, given that the con
test was between two top-five teams.
Stanford-Oregon last season de
served a field storming for the same
reason that Jordan-Hare Stadium
poured onto the field that night follow
ing Chris Davis' 109-yard missed field
goal returned for a touchdown. There
doesn't necessarily need to be an up
set of monumental proportions to stir
up the emotional response necessaiy
to warrant a field storming.

"Kick Bama Kick" created that
emotion because of how unexpected
and historic the occasion was. For a
game won in such a fashion, for a team
that had struggled so mightily the
season before, for a game won over a
Nick Saban Alabama team, it would
be almost unthinkable not to storm
the field for that victory.
In the same vein, the magnitude of
Stanford's victory over Oregon in
2013 was such that an emotional re
sponse capable of justifying a field
storming was almost certain. Given
the recent history of the Stanford-
Oregon rivalry with each team having
broken the other's heart in consecu
tive years, it was a given that the 2013
Oregon game would have an incredi
ble significance to everybody in
volved.

It's not just that; it's that Stanford
had always been considered the lesser
team in the rivalry by college football
fans around the nation. There were
many saying that the 2012 Stanford
victory was a fluke and The Daily
Emerald, Oregon's student newspa
per, was quoted as saying that the dif
ficulty wasn't in deciding who the win
ner would be, but rather the margin of
the final score. Nobody was giving
Stanford a chance in the game.
And then Stanford jumped out to a
26-0 lead in that game, driving Stan
ford Stadium into a frenzy. That in and
of itself would have been enough to
warrant a field storming â€”an ab-

solute shellacking of a seem
ingly unbeatable team. The
fact that Oregon upped the
emotional ante in the building
by making the outcome hinge
on a final onside kick recovery
simply added fuel to the fire.
Best in the west. A field
storming was inevitable.
Hopefully, there will be

more opportunities for those in
the future and hopefully I'll
actually be able to participate
for once.

While Do-Hyoung Park says
he'd like to experience field
storming mania, a man of
his stature is liable to be
trampled. Advise him, on
safe field-storming practices
and give him the number of a
good orthopedic surgeon at
dparko27@stunford.edu and
Tweet, at, him, @dohyoung
park.
