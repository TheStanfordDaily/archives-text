# SECOND-HALF SLUMP
## Card leads by seven at half but falters late 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
For the Stanford men's basket
ball team, the nightmares in Seat
tle just keep on coming. The Cardi
nal (15-8, 6-5 Pac-12) blew a 7-point
halftime lead on Wednesday night,
falling to the Washington Huskies
(14-11, 6-6) 64-60, marking Stan
ford's fifth consecutive loss on the
Huskies' home court. The defeat
dropped Stanford head coach John
ny Dawkins' career record to just
2-10 against his Washington coun
terpart, Lorenzo Romar.

The Cardinal started off strong,
seemingly providing an answer for
every Washington run. After con
secutive dunks by seniors Josh
Huestis and Anthony Brown gave
Stanford a 4-point lead, 3-pointers
on back-to-back possessions by
Washington's leading scorer, senior
C.J. Wilcox, gave the Huskies a 23-
21 lead 15 minutes into the game.
Stanford would respond by closing
the first half on a 13-4 run, powered
mostly by the play of senior Dwight
Powell and junior Chasson Randle,
who combined to score 11 of those
13 points.
The second half began slowly
for the Cardinal, which immediate
ly allowed the Huskies to get back
into the game. Washington started
the second frame on a 12-2 run that
briefly gave it a 3-point lead. Yet

the Cardinal responded once more,
as it had throughout the entire
game up to that point. A 3-point
play from Powell gave Stanford the
lead back with 15:41 left to play,
and the Cardinal would push that
lead back up to five with 11:07 re

maining in the game.
Just when it looked like Stan
ford was ready to pull away from
the Huskies, the Cardinal invited
Washington right back into the
game. Stanford endured a cold
stretch in which it went 0-for-4

from the floor and committed two
turnovers, turning a 5-point lead
into a 1-point deficit with 5:48 left
to play.
The two teams would trade bas-

Senior center Stefan Nastic (left) only played 18 minutes in Wednesday night's game due to foul trouble.
Nastic would eventually foul out of the game after collecting just two points and two rebounds. Senior
forward Josh Huestis (right) also had a tough evening, only scoring nine points on 4-of-8 shooting.
kets down the stretch until
poor free-throw shooting in
the final three minutes be
came Stanford's undoing.
Brown and Randle each
missed key freebies from the
stripe, allowing Washington
a 2-point lead with just 25
seconds left.
On the ensuing posses
sion, it looked for a moment
as if the Cardinal had tied
things up on a Huestis base
line dunk, but the play was
whistled dead beforehand, as
Randle was called for a
charge before the pass. Stan
ford fouled with 4.1 seconds
remaining, but Wilcox calmly
sunk both free throws to
clinch the victory for the un
derdog Huskies, who im
proved to 5-0 at home during
Pac-12 play this season.
Powell was again solid for
the Cardinal, tallying 18
points and nine rebounds in
the defeat. Randle added 17
points, five rebounds, four
steals and three assists, but
he also finished just l-of-6
from behind the arc and was
a disappointing 4-of-9 from
the free-throw line.
Wilcox, who was held to
just nine points in the last
meeting between these two
teams, again struggled from

the floor, shooting just 4-of
-14 despite scoring 17 points
this time around. Freshman
point guard Nigel Williams-
Goss was again solid against
the Cardinal, adding 16
points, five rebounds and
five assists in the Husky vic
tory.
A lack of basic offensive
execution down the stretch
was once again Stanford's
downfall, much in the same
mold as the team's perform
ance against Arizona two
weeks ago. The Cardinal
shot just 8-of-26 30.8 per
cent — in the second half,
which included just a l-for-7
performance from behind
the arc and a 9-for-15 show
ing from the free-throw line.
For the game, Stanford fin
ished at just 40.4 percent
from the field, 18.8 percent
from 3-point range and 61.1
percent from the free-throw
line. Dawkins' squad had its
chances but instead could
not capitalize, shooting itself
right out of Alaska Airlines
Arena.
Stanford will look to re
bound in anticipation of the
team's matchup at Washing
ton State on Saturday. The
Cardinal will be seeking its
first road win against one of
the Washington schools
since a 75-62 triumph at
WSU on Feb. 10,2011.
