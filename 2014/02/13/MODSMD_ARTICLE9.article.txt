# SECOND-HALF SLUMP
## Card leads by seven at half but falters late 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
For the Stanford men's basket
ball team, the nightmares in Seat
tle just keep on coming. The Cardi
nal (15-8, 6-5 Pac-12) blew a 7-point
halftime lead on Wednesday night,
falling to the Washington Huskies
(14-11, 6-6) 64-60, marking Stan
ford's fifth consecutive loss on the
Huskies' home court. The defeat
dropped Stanford head coach John
ny Dawkins' career record to just
2-10 against his Washington coun
terpart, Lorenzo Romar.

The Cardinal started off strong,
seemingly providing an answer for
every Washington run. After con
secutive dunks by seniors Josh
Huestis and Anthony Brown gave
Stanford a 4-point lead, 3-pointers
on back-to-back possessions by
Washington's leading scorer, senior
C.J. Wilcox, gave the Huskies a 23-
21 lead 15 minutes into the game.
Stanford would respond by closing
the first half on a 13-4 run, powered
mostly by the play of senior Dwight
Powell and junior Chasson Randle,
who combined to score 11 of those
13 points.
The second half began slowly
for the Cardinal, which immediate
ly allowed the Huskies to get back
into the game. Washington started
the second frame on a 12-2 run that
briefly gave it a 3-point lead. Yet

the Cardinal responded once more,
as it had throughout the entire
game up to that point. A 3-point
play from Powell gave Stanford the
lead back with 15:41 left to play,
and the Cardinal would push that
lead back up to five with 11:07 re

maining in the game.
Just when it looked like Stan
ford was ready to pull away from
the Huskies, the Cardinal invited
Washington right back into the
game. Stanford endured a cold
stretch in which it went 0-for-4

from the floor and committed two
turnovers, turning a 5-point lead
into a 1-point deficit with 5:48 left
to play.
The two teams would trade bas-
