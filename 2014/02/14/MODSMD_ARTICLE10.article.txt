## MEN'S BASKETBALL Stanford looks to rebound Card's margin for error slim after loss to UW 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
On Wednesday night, victory slipped
through the fingers of the Stanford men's bas
ketball team. A disastrous second half result
ed in a 4-point loss to a Washington team that
the Cardinal (15-8, 6-5 Pac-12) had already
beaten by 12 earlier this season, precisely the
type of loss this team cannot afford if it hopes
to make a run to the NCAA Tournament.

The Cardinal will have to do a better job
of avoiding that kind of performance Saturday
in Pullman, Wash., when it takes on the Wash
ington State Cougars (9-15, 2-10) in a game
that it absolutely, unequivocally must win.
Despite having given Cal everything it wanted
and more in Wednesday's overtime loss, the
Cougars are clearly one of the two worst
teams in the Pac-12, the type of team that Big
Dance participants are supposed to beat
handily, even on the road. If Stanford aspires
to be among that group of teams come
March, it must do as such on Saturday.
Washington State's season-long struggles
notwithstanding, the complexion of playing
the Cougars has certainly changed since last
time the Cardinal saw them. WSU's leading
scorer, junior guard DaVonte Lacy, has re
turned from an injury that sidelined him for
seven of the team's first eight conference
