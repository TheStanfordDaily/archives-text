## MEN'S BASKETBALL Stanford looks to rebound Card's margin for error slim after loss to UW 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
On Wednesday night, victory slipped
through the fingers of the Stanford men's bas
ketball team. A disastrous second half result
ed in a 4-point loss to a Washington team that
the Cardinal (15-8, 6-5 Pac-12) had already
beaten by 12 earlier this season, precisely the
type of loss this team cannot afford if it hopes
to make a run to the NCAA Tournament.

The Cardinal will have to do a better job
of avoiding that kind of performance Saturday
in Pullman, Wash., when it takes on the Wash
ington State Cougars (9-15, 2-10) in a game
that it absolutely, unequivocally must win.
Despite having given Cal everything it wanted
and more in Wednesday's overtime loss, the
Cougars are clearly one of the two worst
teams in the Pac-12, the type of team that Big
Dance participants are supposed to beat
handily, even on the road. If Stanford aspires
to be among that group of teams come
March, it must do as such on Saturday.
Washington State's season-long struggles
notwithstanding, the complexion of playing
the Cougars has certainly changed since last
time the Cardinal saw them. WSU's leading
scorer, junior guard DaVonte Lacy, has re
turned from an injury that sidelined him for
seven of the team's first eight conference
games. And indeed, he has re
turned with a vengeance.
Lacy already has two 30-point
games to his credit since his return
two weeks ago, and his 39-point out
burst against Cal was particularly vi
cious. Lacy made eight three-point
ers on 15 attempts and was a perfect
11-of-11 from the foul line, single
handedly carrying his team to the
brink of victory.
NBA legend Bill Russell, wisest
of the basketball wise, once re
marked, "This game has always
been, and will always be, about
buckets." Lacy clearly ascribes to
that philosophy, and the Cardinal
coaching staff would be sage to place
particular emphasis on stopping
him.

Yet even with Lacy's heroics, it is
clear that Washington State does not
have enough else on its roster to de
feat good teams. The Cougars have
lost four of the five games this season
in which Lacy has scored more than
25 points, and the sole victory came
over lowly Cal State Bakersfield in
WSU's season opener.
As such, Stanford must do a
good job of making sure that Wash
ington State's other offensive play
ers don't have uncharacteristically
good nights. Foremost amongst
them is freshman Que Johnson,
who at 10.3 points per game is the
Cougars' second-leading scorer and
the only other truly dynamic scor
ing threat that Washington State
possesses. Johnson matched his ca
reer high with 21 points against
Stanford on Jan. 15, and the Cardi
nal would be sorry to let him score
as much this time around.

In the larger scheme of things,
it is crucial that Stanford finds some
sort of consistent offensive produc
tion from its bench. Against Wash
ington on Wednesday, the bench
was held to just two points on 1-of
-5 shooting, both coming via senior
forward John Gage.
Stanford's depth has been rav
aged by injury this season, and the
hole it has left was extremely appar

ent on Wednesday night. When the
starters have an off-shooting night
like they did against the Huskies,
the instances in which Stanford's
bench has stepped up to fill the
void the season have been few and
far in between. Barring the return
of sophomore Rosco Allen, who has
been sidelined all season with a
stress fracture in his foot, it will be
up to the current group of Gage,
senior Robbie Lemons, sophomore
Grant Verhoeven and freshman

Marcus Allen to find some way to
provide a little extra punch.

Stanford will seek to reestab
lish the positive momentum it had
gained before Wednesday's loss at 4
p.m. on Saturday, when it will again
attempt to register its first victory
in the state of Washington since
2011. The game will be televised
on Pac-12 Networks.

that it absolutely, unequivocally must win.
Despite having given Cal everything it wanted
and more in Wednesday's overtime loss, the
Cougars are clearly one of the two worst
teams in the Pac-12, the type of team that Big
Dance participants are supposed to beat
handily, even on the road. If Stanford aspires
to be among that group of teams come
March, it must do as such on Saturday.
Washington State's season-long struggles
notwithstanding, the complexion of playing
the Cougars has certainly changed since last
time the Cardinal saw them. WSU's leading
scorer, junior guard DaVonte Lacy, has re
turned from an injury that sidelined him for
seven of the team's first eight conference
games. And indeed, he has re
turned with a vengeance.
Lacy already has two 30-point
games to his credit since his return
two weeks ago, and his 39-point out
burst against Cal was particularly vi
cious. Lacy made eight three-point
ers on 15 attempts and was a perfect
11-of-11 from the foul line, single
handedly carrying his team to the
brink of victory.
NBA legend Bill Russell, wisest
of the basketball wise, once re
marked, "This game has always
been, and will always be, about
buckets." Lacy clearly ascribes to
that philosophy, and the Cardinal
coaching staff would be sage to place
particular emphasis on stopping
him.

Yet even with Lacy's heroics, it is
clear that Washington State does not
have enough else on its roster to de
feat good teams. The Cougars have
lost four of the five games this season
in which Lacy has scored more than
25 points, and the sole victory came
over lowly Cal State Bakersfield in
WSU's season opener.
As such, Stanford must do a
good job of making sure that Wash
ington State's other offensive play
ers don't have uncharacteristically
good nights. Foremost amongst
them is freshman Que Johnson,
who at 10.3 points per game is the
Cougars' second-leading scorer and
the only other truly dynamic scor
ing threat that Washington State
possesses. Johnson matched his ca
reer high with 21 points against
Stanford on Jan. 15, and the Cardi
nal would be sorry to let him score
as much this time around.

In the larger scheme of things,
it is crucial that Stanford finds some
sort of consistent offensive produc
tion from its bench. Against Wash
ington on Wednesday, the bench
was held to just two points on 1-of
-5 shooting, both coming via senior
forward John Gage.
Stanford's depth has been rav
aged by injury this season, and the
hole it has left was extremely appar

ent on Wednesday night. When the
starters have an off-shooting night
like they did against the Huskies,
the instances in which Stanford's
bench has stepped up to fill the
void the season have been few and
far in between. Barring the return
of sophomore Rosco Allen, who has
been sidelined all season with a
stress fracture in his foot, it will be
up to the current group of Gage,
senior Robbie Lemons, sophomore
Grant Verhoeven and freshman

Marcus Allen to find some way to
provide a little extra punch.

Stanford will seek to reestab
lish the positive momentum it had
gained before Wednesday's loss at 4
p.m. on Saturday, when it will again
attempt to register its first victory
in the state of Washington since
2011. The game will be televised
on Pac-12 Networks.

Stanford has struggled with its bench production all year, but it has often
turned to senior John Gage (above) to make up for its lack of depth. Gage
will need to do better Saturday than his two points against Washington.
