# BASEBALL IS BACK
## UNPROVEN CARD BEGINS SEASON AGAINST RICE 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN DESK EDITOR 
For this year's Stanford baseball team,
Valentine's Day will be more than just a day
of romance; it will be a day of rejuvenation,
of a clean slate and of the chance to make a
statement at the beginning of a long cam
paign.
That's right baseball is back on the
Farm.

On Friday, Sunken Diamond will arise
from its eight-month slumber as the No. 25
Cardinal hosts the No. 20 Rice Owls for a
three-game weekend bout.
Stanford has opened the season against
Rice in three out of the last four seasons,
holding a 6-3 record in those opening-week
contests. The Card dropped last year's open
ing series in Houston, only winning one

game during the three-game set.
While the same team will be in the op
posing dugout, this year's matchup against
Rice will feel very different, as the Cardinal
replaces last year's opening-day starter
first overall 2013 MLB Draft pick Mark Ap
pel'l3 â€”with right-handed pitcher Cal
Quantrill, a freshman making his first ever
collegiate appearance let alone start.
Fittingly, in a season that figures to be
defined by change, the Cardinal will send
out a new face in Quantrill in the Friday
evening slot that Appel had locked down for
so long. Tonight's showdown will mark the
first opening-day start by a Cardinal fresh
man in at least 20 years.
Despite his lack of collegiate experi
ence, the hard-throwing freshman from Port
Hope, Ontario, who was drafted in the 26th
round in 2013 by the New York Yankees,

certainly has the talent to begin filling the
gargantuan shoes of Appel, the program's all
time strikeout leader.

But the Cardinal youth movement on
the mound won't end on Friday. The project
ed starters for games two and three of the
series, righties Brett Hanewich and Chris
Viall, are also freshmen making their first
collegiate starts.
Stanford pitching coach Rusty Filter has
tabbed Flanewich, a Bradenton, Fla., native
and brother of Cardinal Softball senior Corey
Hanewich, as the starter for Saturday's con
test. Meanwhile, Viall will pitch in the final
game of the series, which will be held either
Sunday afternoon or Saturday evening, de
pending on the weather. Viall, who stands at
6-foot-9 and weighs in at 230 pounds, boasts

a fastball in the mid-90s and was
drafted by the San Francisco Giants
in last year's MLB Draft. He will
look to add a tremendous arm to
the Cardinal starting rotation.
Ultimately, the starting pitch
ing situation for Stanford will come
down to a tradeoff between talent
and experience as the Cardinal's
highly touted starters clash with
one of the top programs in college
baseball.

In contrast, the Owls will most
likely counter with the experienced
junior Jordan Stephens, who led all
Rice hurlers with 118.2 innings
pitched last season. While the Car
dinal did get the better of Stephens
in the second game of last year's
series, the right-handed pitcher im
proved markedly as the season pro
gressed and will look to be, in the
words of Rice head coach Wayne
Graham, "one of the top 'Friday
night' guys in the country."
Stephens possesses a reliable fast
ball coupled with a lethal off-speed
pitch, which will certainly pose a
challenge for the Cardinal lineup.
In addition to Stephens, the
Owls also field one of the top relief
pitchers in all of college baseball
in junior Zach Lemond, a third
team All-American last season
who serves as a dangerous
weapon for Rice out of the
bullpen. The Owls have yet to an
nounce their starters for the re
maining games in the series.
The Owls also appear to have
the edge in experience in the bat
ter's box, as they return seniors
Shane Hoelscher and Michael
Aquino, the latter of whom was a
second-team all-conference per
former last year. Hoelscher was on
pace to have one of the best statis
tical seasons in all of college base
ball before an injury in March halt
ed his pace.

Meanwhile, the Cardinal will
be looking for someone to step up
and add power to the lineup with
the departures of outfielder Austin
Wilson and first baseman Brian Ra
gira. Stanford will look for its offen
sive firepower to come from more
production out of the established
starters who return: junior third
baseman Alex Blandino, senior first
baseman Danny Diekroeger, junior
center fielder Austin Slater, senior
catcher Brant Whiting and junior
designated hitter Wayne Taylor.
In a matchup between two of
the most successful college baseball
programs in the last 15 years and
two coaches in Graham and Stan
ford's Mark Marquess who have

combined for over 2,400 wins, this
weekend's opening series will kick
off a new season at Sunken Dia
mond and provide an indication of
where the Cardinal stands coming
out of the gate.
The season opens Friday at
4:30 p.m. with the weekend
games, if the weather holds, sched
uled for Saturday at 2 p.m. and Sun
day at noon.
With the high hopes and
dreams that come with opening
day, maybe it's fitting that Stanford
opens its season on Valentine's Day.
As Brad Pitt's character asks in the
movie Moneyball, "How can you
not be romantic about baseball?"
