# BASEBALL IS BACK
## UNPROVEN CARD BEGINS SEASON AGAINST RICE 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN DESK EDITOR 
For this year's Stanford baseball team,
Valentine's Day will be more than just a day
of romance; it will be a day of rejuvenation,
of a clean slate and of the chance to make a
statement at the beginning of a long cam
paign.
That's right baseball is back on the
Farm.

On Friday, Sunken Diamond will arise
from its eight-month slumber as the No. 25
Cardinal hosts the No. 20 Rice Owls for a
three-game weekend bout.
Stanford has opened the season against
Rice in three out of the last four seasons,
holding a 6-3 record in those opening-week
contests. The Card dropped last year's open
ing series in Houston, only winning one

game during the three-game set.
While the same team will be in the op
posing dugout, this year's matchup against
Rice will feel very different, as the Cardinal
replaces last year's opening-day starter
first overall 2013 MLB Draft pick Mark Ap
pel'l3 â€”with right-handed pitcher Cal
Quantrill, a freshman making his first ever
collegiate appearance let alone start.
Fittingly, in a season that figures to be
defined by change, the Cardinal will send
out a new face in Quantrill in the Friday
evening slot that Appel had locked down for
so long. Tonight's showdown will mark the
first opening-day start by a Cardinal fresh
man in at least 20 years.
Despite his lack of collegiate experi
ence, the hard-throwing freshman from Port
Hope, Ontario, who was drafted in the 26th
round in 2013 by the New York Yankees,

certainly has the talent to begin filling the
gargantuan shoes of Appel, the program's all
time strikeout leader.

But the Cardinal youth movement on
the mound won't end on Friday. The project
ed starters for games two and three of the
series, righties Brett Hanewich and Chris
Viall, are also freshmen making their first
collegiate starts.
Stanford pitching coach Rusty Filter has
tabbed Flanewich, a Bradenton, Fla., native
and brother of Cardinal Softball senior Corey
Hanewich, as the starter for Saturday's con
test. Meanwhile, Viall will pitch in the final
game of the series, which will be held either
Sunday afternoon or Saturday evening, de
pending on the weather. Viall, who stands at
6-foot-9 and weighs in at 230 pounds, boasts
