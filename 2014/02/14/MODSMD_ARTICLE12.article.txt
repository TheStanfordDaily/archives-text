# Perfect start on the line

After dispatching its competition at
the Kajikawa Classic with relative ease,
the No. 14 Cardinal softball team will
come home to play its first set of home
games at Boyd and Jill Smith Family Sta
dium. The Cardinal moved to 6-0 on the
season after outscoring its opponents
60-6 in six games in Tempe, Ariz., and
the Card will look to continue its hot
start when the Nike Invitational begins
on Friday morning.
At the Kajikawa Classic, Stanford's
five freshmen all had significant impacts
in their first games in Cardinal uniforms.
In the circle, Maddi Schreyer and Carley
Floover picked up all six victories for the
Card, with both maintaining ERAs well
below 3.00. Kylie Sorenson started all six
games at shortstop for the Cardinal,
where she did not commit a single error
at the difficult position. In addition,
Sorenson also made a big contribution on
offense, as she batted .444 with four ex
tra-base hits and 8 RBI.

Bessie Noll made all six starts in right
field for the Card while hitting a team
best .647 at the plate. In particular, Noll's
2-for-3, 2-RBI game helped key a 15-0
rout on Saturday afternoon against West
ern Michigan. Finally, Lauren Bertoy bat
ted .333 as a pinch hitter for the Cardinal
and made the most of her plate appear
ances with a 2-run single to left field
against San Diego State that gave Stan
ford a 13-1 lead.

Jessica Plaza also had an outstanding
week both on and off the field for the
Cardinal. After the sophomore was se
lected as one of 24 players who will par
ticipate in tryouts for the 2014 United
States Softball Women's National Team,
Plaza proceeded to tee off on opposing
pitching at the Kajikawa Classic. The
Huntington Beach, Calif, product had

three home runs in the Arizona desert,
including the first multi-homer game of
her college career against Indiana. In ad
dition to leading the team in home runs,
Plaza also leads the Card in slugging per
centage with a 1.167 mark.
Stanford will play five games as part
of its Nike Invitational slate, including Fri
day and Saturday afternoon contests
against the Cal Poly Mustangs (2-3). Cal
Poly also opened its season with a series
of games at the Kajikawa Classic last
weekend and played three opponents
that the Cardinal also faced: San Diego
State, Seattle University and Indiana.
While the Cardinal defeated all three of
those teams via the mercy rule, Cal Poly
notched a combined 1-2 record against
the Aztecs, Redhawks and Hoosiers.
The Mustangs defeated the Hoosiers
9-2 on the final day of the Kajikawa Clas
sic; in turn, Cal Poly lost 8-4 to Seattle
University in its Friday opener and fell to
San Diego State 6-3 Saturday afternoon.
However, despite Cal Poly's inconsistent
play in Arizona, the Mustangs showed
that, on their best day, they are capable of
playing with the elite teams in the coun
try, as evidenced by their upset of then-
No. 8 Oregon on the second day of the
Classic

The Cardinal will also play against

the Bradley Braves of the Missouri Valley
Conference in two games on Friday
evening and Saturday afternoon. Bradley
(0-5) had a rough start to its season at the
Kajikawa Classic; in addition to a heart
breaking extra-innings loss to Indiana in
its opening game, the Braves were blown
out by then No. 24 Cal 10-3 and also suf
fered an 8-0 defeat against the Colorado
State Rams.

Finally, Stanford will finish off its par
ticipation in the Nike Invitational with a
Sunday matinee against the Pacific
Tigers. While Pacific (1-0) had its season
opening doubleheader against Sacramen
to State rained out, the Tigers were able
to win at UC-Davis to start their 2014
season off on a positive note. The Tigers
and Cardinal met twice last season, with
each team protecting its home field in
their non-conference matchups; the Card
knocked off the Tigers 2-0 in their first
meeting last season before the Tigers re
turned the favor by stunning the then-
No. 15 Cardinal 9-6 in Stockton, Calif.

The Cardinal will kick off the Nike
Invitational at 2:30 p.m. this afternoon
against Cal Poly before facing Bradley at
4:45 p.m.
