# WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
## ASU looks to narrow Pac- 12 gap Cardinal leads No. 15 Sun Devils by just two games 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
The No. 6 Stanford women's basketball team (22-
2, 11-1 Pac-12) is in relatively uncharted territory right
now. Sunday's loss to Washington marked the first loss
in nearly three months and only the second conference
loss since 2009 for the Cardinal women. Unfortunate
ly, there is no rest for the weary, as the Cardinal will
play host to No. 15 Arizona State (20-4, 9-3) tonight in
what looks to be a challenging matchup for the Pac-12
leaders.

The Sun Devils come into the matchup as the sec
ond-place team in the Pac-12, two games behind Stan
ford in the conference standings. Fortunately for the
Cardinal, Arizona State is also reeling after suffering a
stunning upset of its own at the hands of conference
cellar-dweller Arizona, which netted its first confer
ence victory with a 68-49 shocker at home.
With both teams looking to rebound from bad
losses, the pressure will be high in Maples Pavilion this
evening. Both the Cardinal and Sun Devils suffered
from uncharacteristically inaccurate shooting in those
losses, with both teams shooting more than 10 percent
below their season averages from the field.
However, the Cardinal will have the advantage
from the field in tonight's matchup, as Stanford boasts
the best shooting defense in the conference while the
Sun Devils clock in at 11th place in that statistic, allow
ing their opponents to shoot over 43 percent from the
field. In the loss to Arizona, the Sun Devils allowed the
Wildcats who boast the worst statistical offense in
the conference to make nearly 55 percent of their
shots.

One of the keys to limiting the Sun Devils' efficacy
on the court will be corralling as many rebounds as
possible. Arizona State is second in the conference in
offensive rebounding and first in rebounding defense,
which, when coupled with its stellar shooting from the
field, has more than made up for
the Sun Devils' inability to play sol
id shooting defense all season.
Winning the rebound battle
will rest on the shoulders of sen
ior forward Chiney Ogwumike
and fifth-year senior forward
Mikaela Ruef, who both come into
the matchup ranked in the top five
in the conference in rebounding
with 12.3 and 9.8 rebounds per
game, respectively. For Ruef, it
will just be a matter of building on
a career-best day in the loss
against Washington, in which she
grabbed an eye-popping 22
boards. For Ogwumike, it will just
be a matter of staying the course

and continuing her physical play in
the paint.
With a solid effort tonight,
Ogwumike will look to solidify her
status as one of the 10 finalists for
the Senior CLASS Award and a
Naismith Trophy Midseason Top
30 candidate.

The Sun Devils are led by
fifth-year senior guard Deja Mann,
a California native averaging 11.5
points per game this season. Al
though Mann contributed a solid
15-point effort in the loss to the
Wildcats, a lack of contributions
from her teammates ultimately
doomed the Sun Devils. No other
ASU player scored more than six
points in the upset, and the other
10 players that saw action that
night combined to go 0-of-6 from
behind the arc uncharacteristic
of a team averaging 34 percent
from downtown this season.

A pair of freshman forwards,

Sophie Brunner and Kelsey Moos,
has led the Sun Devils in rebounds
this season, with each of them
netting over six boards per game.
Although they both measure in at
over six feet in height, they will be
at a size disadvantage against the
Cardinal's rebounding forward
duo of Ruef and Ogwumike.

With a win over the Sun Dev
ils, the Cardinal will be in good
position to pick up its 13th con
secutive Pac-12 title and earn a
first-round bye in the Pac-12 Tour
nament. With a loss, however, the
Cardinal will see its conference
lead dwindle to just one game
with a tough matchup against third
place USC still looming in a week.
Tipoff against the Sun Devils
at Maples Pavilion will be at 7 p.m.
tonight.

Senior forward Chiney Ogwumike (above) will look to control the offensive
boards against an Arizona State team that is one of the best rebounding
squads in the Pac- 12.The teams face off at Maples at 7 p.m. tonight.
The No. 6 Stanford women's basketball team (22-
2, 11-1 Pac-12) is in relatively uncharted territory right
now. Sunday's loss to Washington marked the first loss
in nearly three months and only the second conference
loss since 2009 for the Cardinal women. Unfortunate
ly, there is no rest for the weary, as the Cardinal will
play host to No. 15 Arizona State (20-4, 9-3) tonight in
what looks to be a challenging matchup for the Pac-12
leaders.

The Sun Devils come into the matchup as the sec
ond-place team in the Pac-12, two games behind Stan
ford in the conference standings. Fortunately for the
Cardinal, Arizona State is also reeling after suffering a
stunning upset of its own at the hands of conference
cellar-dweller Arizona, which netted its first confer
ence victory with a 68-49 shocker at home.
With both teams looking to rebound from bad
losses, the pressure will be high in Maples Pavilion this
evening. Both the Cardinal and Sun Devils suffered
from uncharacteristically inaccurate shooting in those
losses, with both teams shooting more than 10 percent
below their season averages from the field.
However, the Cardinal will have the advantage
from the field in tonight's matchup, as Stanford boasts
the best shooting defense in the conference while the
Sun Devils clock in at 11th place in that statistic, allow
ing their opponents to shoot over 43 percent from the
field. In the loss to Arizona, the Sun Devils allowed the
Wildcats who boast the worst statistical offense in
the conference to make nearly 55 percent of their
shots.

One of the keys to limiting the Sun Devils' efficacy
on the court will be corralling as many rebounds as
possible. Arizona State is second in the conference in
offensive rebounding and first in rebounding defense,
which, when coupled with its stellar shooting from the
field, has more than made up for
the Sun Devils' inability to play sol
id shooting defense all season.
Winning the rebound battle
will rest on the shoulders of sen
ior forward Chiney Ogwumike
and fifth-year senior forward
Mikaela Ruef, who both come into
the matchup ranked in the top five
in the conference in rebounding
with 12.3 and 9.8 rebounds per
game, respectively. For Ruef, it
will just be a matter of building on
a career-best day in the loss
against Washington, in which she
grabbed an eye-popping 22
boards. For Ogwumike, it will just
be a matter of staying the course

and continuing her physical play in
the paint.
With a solid effort tonight,
Ogwumike will look to solidify her
status as one of the 10 finalists for
the Senior CLASS Award and a
Naismith Trophy Midseason Top
30 candidate.

The Sun Devils are led by
fifth-year senior guard Deja Mann,
a California native averaging 11.5
points per game this season. Al
though Mann contributed a solid
15-point effort in the loss to the
Wildcats, a lack of contributions
from her teammates ultimately
doomed the Sun Devils. No other
ASU player scored more than six
points in the upset, and the other
10 players that saw action that
night combined to go 0-of-6 from
behind the arc uncharacteristic
of a team averaging 34 percent
from downtown this season.

A pair of freshman forwards,

Sophie Brunner and Kelsey Moos,
has led the Sun Devils in rebounds
this season, with each of them
netting over six boards per game.
Although they both measure in at
over six feet in height, they will be
at a size disadvantage against the
Cardinal's rebounding forward
duo of Ruef and Ogwumike.

With a win over the Sun Dev
ils, the Cardinal will be in good
position to pick up its 13th con
secutive Pac-12 title and earn a
first-round bye in the Pac-12 Tour
nament. With a loss, however, the
Cardinal will see its conference
lead dwindle to just one game
with a tough matchup against third
place USC still looming in a week.
Tipoff against the Sun Devils
at Maples Pavilion will be at 7 p.m.
tonight.
