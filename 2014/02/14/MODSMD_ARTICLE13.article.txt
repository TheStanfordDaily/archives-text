## ASU looks to narrow Pac- 12 gap Cardinal leads No. 15 Sun Devils by just two games 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
The No. 6 Stanford women's basketball team (22-
2, 11-1 Pac-12) is in relatively uncharted territory right
now. Sunday's loss to Washington marked the first loss
in nearly three months and only the second conference
loss since 2009 for the Cardinal women. Unfortunate
ly, there is no rest for the weary, as the Cardinal will
play host to No. 15 Arizona State (20-4, 9-3) tonight in
what looks to be a challenging matchup for the Pac-12
leaders.

The Sun Devils come into the matchup as the sec
ond-place team in the Pac-12, two games behind Stan
ford in the conference standings. Fortunately for the
Cardinal, Arizona State is also reeling after suffering a
stunning upset of its own at the hands of conference
cellar-dweller Arizona, which netted its first confer
ence victory with a 68-49 shocker at home.
With both teams looking to rebound from bad
losses, the pressure will be high in Maples Pavilion this
evening. Both the Cardinal and Sun Devils suffered
from uncharacteristically inaccurate shooting in those
losses, with both teams shooting more than 10 percent
below their season averages from the field.
However, the Cardinal will have the advantage
from the field in tonight's matchup, as Stanford boasts
the best shooting defense in the conference while the
Sun Devils clock in at 11th place in that statistic, allow
ing their opponents to shoot over 43 percent from the
field. In the loss to Arizona, the Sun Devils allowed the
Wildcats who boast the worst statistical offense in
the conference to make nearly 55 percent of their
shots.

One of the keys to limiting the Sun Devils' efficacy
on the court will be corralling as many rebounds as
possible. Arizona State is second in the conference in
offensive rebounding and first in rebounding defense,
which, when coupled with its stellar shooting from the
