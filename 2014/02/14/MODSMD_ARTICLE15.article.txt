Welcome to the new college football.

If the NCAA football rules committee
has its way, the wings of the quick-strike
Ducks offense will be clipped somewhat
in 2014, with a new regulation prohibit
ing teams from snapping the ball during
the first 10 seconds of the play clock (ex
cept in the final two minutes of the half).
Oregon has averaged about 15 seconds
between plays in previous years, but it has
also snapped the ball in as few as five sec
onds. Next season, it seems that would re
sult in an absurdly named "delay of game"
penalty.
The rule is intended to give the de
fense a chance to substitute players
against no-huddle offenses, which would

prevent injuries to winded defend
ers. I'm not here to discuss the
merit of that thinking, which has
taken a beating in the media this
week.

My question is: What does
this mean for Stanford?
The obvious answer is that the
Cardinal, with its meticulous, pro
style attack, will benefit on the de
fensive side of the ball infinitely
more than it will be harmed on of
fense. And though I'm confident
that this program has the legs to re
place outgoing studs like Shayne
Skov 'l3, Trent Murphy 'l3, Ben
Gardner 'l3 and Ed Reynolds '14,1
also think that the Stanford de
fense should be happy with every
edge it can get in 2014.
On the other hand, take a look
at what Gardner posted to Twitter
on Wednesday: "The new rule pro
posal in [college football] is not
needed if you ask me. There's an
easier way to slow down offenses:
don't let them get [first] downs."
Easy to say for Gardner, who
will never have to face Mariota and
Co. again.
But there's a deeper meaning
to the implied hubris of the Cardi
nal defense, which has earned re

spect as the only unit in the coun
try to have demonstrated any sort
of consistency in stopping the
Ducks. There's a chance that the
Cardinal's targeted recruiting,
which has been aimed specifically
at defensive players fast enough to
keep up with Oregon's speedsters,
and its world-class conditioning,
which has made the no-huddle a
non-issue, will no longer set it
apart from other college football
teams. What will be Stanford's
identity, if not," the team that beat
Oregon?"

The Cardinal's coaches proba
bly don't care about that percep
tion issue. Personally, I'll miss the
two November nights when the
free-flying Ducks couldn't get past
Stanford on national TV.

But at the end of the day, it's
just a couple of seconds. People al
ways tell us to slow down and en
joy the best years of our lives;
shouldn't that apply in Eugene as
well?

Waddle slowly, my friends.
Waddle slowly.

Joseph Beyda is going to eat his
words when Oregon debuts its
sumo-wrestier-based power offense
next year to physically overwhelm
the Cardinal. Tell him about how
Mark Helfrich always has something
new up his sleeve at jbeyda@stan

ing teams from snapping the ball during
the first 10 seconds of the play clock (ex
cept in the final two minutes of the half).
Oregon has averaged about 15 seconds
between plays in previous years, but it has
also snapped the ball in as few as five sec
onds. Next season, it seems that would re
sult in an absurdly named "delay of game"
penalty.
The rule is intended to give the de
fense a chance to substitute players
against no-huddle offenses, which would

prevent injuries to winded defend
ers. I'm not here to discuss the
merit of that thinking, which has
taken a beating in the media this
week.

My question is: What does
this mean for Stanford?
The obvious answer is that the
Cardinal, with its meticulous, pro
style attack, will benefit on the de
fensive side of the ball infinitely
more than it will be harmed on of
fense. And though I'm confident
that this program has the legs to re
place outgoing studs like Shayne
Skov 'l3, Trent Murphy 'l3, Ben
Gardner 'l3 and Ed Reynolds '14,1
also think that the Stanford de
fense should be happy with every
edge it can get in 2014.
On the other hand, take a look
at what Gardner posted to Twitter
on Wednesday: "The new rule pro
posal in [college football] is not
needed if you ask me. There's an
easier way to slow down offenses:
don't let them get [first] downs."
Easy to say for Gardner, who
will never have to face Mariota and
Co. again.
But there's a deeper meaning
to the implied hubris of the Cardi
nal defense, which has earned re

spect as the only unit in the coun
try to have demonstrated any sort
of consistency in stopping the
Ducks. There's a chance that the
Cardinal's targeted recruiting,
which has been aimed specifically
at defensive players fast enough to
keep up with Oregon's speedsters,
and its world-class conditioning,
which has made the no-huddle a
non-issue, will no longer set it
apart from other college football
teams. What will be Stanford's
identity, if not," the team that beat
Oregon?"

The Cardinal's coaches proba
bly don't care about that percep
tion issue. Personally, I'll miss the
two November nights when the
free-flying Ducks couldn't get past
Stanford on national TV.

But at the end of the day, it's
just a couple of seconds. People al
ways tell us to slow down and en
joy the best years of our lives;
shouldn't that apply in Eugene as
well?

Waddle slowly, my friends.
Waddle slowly.

Joseph Beyda is going to eat his
words when Oregon debuts its
sumo-wrestier-based power offense
next year to physically overwhelm
the Cardinal. Tell him about how
Mark Helfrich always has something
