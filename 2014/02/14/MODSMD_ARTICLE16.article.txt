## Experienced Card opens 2014 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
After graduating just two seniors and
adding a talented group of nine freshmen and
one transfer, the Stanford lacrosse team is
poised to improve on its record-setting 2013
season.

Last year, the Cardinal stormed to its
eighth MPSF tournament title in nine years,
capped off by a 7-6 win over Denver in the fi
nal. The team followed up that effort with a
thrilling last-second upset of Notre Dame to
capture the first NCAA Tournament victory in
program history. The season came to an end
with a 15-8 loss to eventual semifinalist North
western in the second round of the tourna
ment.

The Cardinal will kick off the 2014 cam
paign with a game against Ohio State at 1 p.m.
tomorrow. Last season, Stanford travelled to
Ohio and battled both the Buckeyes and the
March elements to bring back a 12-10 win.
The Stanford starting lineup will be famil
iar to Cardinal fans, as 11 of 12 starters will re
turn from a year ago. Senior goalkeeper Lynd
sey Munoz will hold down the fort in net for
the third consecutive season. Last year,
Munoz posted a 10.77 goals-against average
and was named to the MPSF all-tournament
team.

In front of Munoz, first-team All-MPSF
selection Meg Lerner will be expected to lead
the defense once again. The senior set a sin
gle-season record by collecting 63 draw con
trols last year and also led the Cardinal in
caused turnovers, with 25. Junior Rachel
Kalick and senior Nina Swanson, both of
whom started every game last year, also return
to give Stanford a veteran core at the defen
sive end of the field.

On attack, the Card returns 99 percent of
its goal-scoring production from a year ago, in
cluding senior first-team All-MPSF selections
Rachel Ozer and Anna Kim.

Ozer led Stanford with 48 goals and 24
assists last year after missing most of the
2012 season with an injury. Kim was named
to the Tewaarton Award watch list after tally
ing 32 goals, 11 assists and 56 draw controls
last season.

Senior goalkeeper Lyndsey Munoz (above) will begin her third straight year between the
posts for the Cardinal as the team opens the season against Ohio State on Saturday.
The team's fourth first-team
MPSF selection, Hannah Farr, will
start again in the midfield, while fel
low junior Kyle Fraser will once
again add another dimension to the
attack. Farr, who also plays for the
women's soccer team, scored with
four seconds remaining to knock off
Notre Dame in Stanford's historic
NCAA tournament win last year.
In addition to its upperclass
men leaders, the Card will look for
its sophomore class to step up after
making heavy contributions as
freshmen last year. Second-team All-
MPSF selection Lucy Dikeou re
turns on attack alongside Julia
Burns, who was the team's second

leading scorer a year ago. Adrienne
Anderson, Meg Lentz and Macken
zie Tesei will also be expected to im
prove in their second years.
Sophomore Alexandra Crerend
also presents an intriguing option
for head coach Amy Bokker. In
2012, Crerend led the Brown
women's lacrosse team with 24
goals before taking a year off and
then transferring to Stanford. This
weekend will mark Crerend's Stan
ford debut as well as the collegiate
debut for nine freshmen.

Following the Ohio State game,
the Card will have two more out-of
conference matchups against Har
vard and Vanderbilt, both at home,
before opening MPSF play with a
game at Fresno State on March 5.
