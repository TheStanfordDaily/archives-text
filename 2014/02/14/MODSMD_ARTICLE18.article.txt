## FOOD REVIEW: Palo Alto Grill offers hearty fare 
### RENJIE WONG STAFF WRITER 
We've all been on that
one Valentine's dinner
from hell. You know the
one: tacky decor, mid
dling food, overpriced
wine and worst of all

the rude waiter, sick from serv
ing roomfuls of doe-eyed couples
all night. At best, it is the worst
date you and your valentine will
have; at worst, it is your last.
But that's not going to happen
this time not at Stanford, not in
Palo Alto, and especially not on
our watch. In our commitment to
uncovering only the best dining
experiences, we at The Daily
scoured the boulevards and back
alleys for the finest Valentine's Day
meal in the 650 ... and found it at
Palo Alto Grill.
Situated in the heart of Palo
Alto, the young restaurant has
been making waves in the dining
scene since opening last April. Led
by Executive Chef Ryan Shelton,
the establishment is the happy
lovechild of a classic steakhouse
and an edgy nouvelle cuisine
joint. With a focus on Bay Area
produce, Palo Alto Grill comfort
ably fills the niche of an upscale,
unpretentious neighbourhood
restaurant.

Shelton's pedigree is sterling:
having previously worked at Chez
TJ and Baume, two of the neigh

bourhood's Michelin joints, he has
accrued a gruelling decade of
training under his belt. This invalu
able experience has translated into
a chef who knows what the diner
wants.

"When I was younger I'd
bring my ego into the kitchen,"
Shelton said, "and it took me a
good number of years to realize
that the customer writes the
menu, not me."
His vision, then, is apparent in
the Valentine's Day menu. Bring
ing together the finest items in his
repertoire, Shelton's selection for
the evening is presented a la carte,
with smaller portions designed so
that guests can taste a wider vari
ety of his culinary confections.
Palo Alto Grill's Dungeness
crab cakes are the restaurant
world's Kardashians: juicy, meaty
and unbelievably addicting. What
appears at first to be a layer of gua
camole under the crab cakes turns
out to be an earthy pea puree,
complementing the crab's sweet
ness in away that only vine
ripened peas can. It is the accom
panying slow-poached egg, howev
er, that steals the show. Heated at
62 degrees Celsius for precisely 1
hour and 52 minutes, the resulting
congelation is a vision of Jello-like
beauty; tracing my fork over the
yolk causes it to ooze molten gold,
forming a puddle of dipping sauce
