# VIOLIN VIRTUOSO
## Joshua Bell dazzles Bing audience 
### ELIZABETH WOODSON 
Joshua Bell has been described as a "poet of vi
olin," a title he confirmed with gusto on Sat
urday night at Bing Concert Hall. Bringing life
and drama to a program that featured musi
cians from disparate eras, from Giuseppe Tar
tini to Igor Stravinsky, Bell ravished the sold
out audience in a show that lasted almost two hours.

Bell's world-class technique and stunning bow
control created an effortless connection of musical
lines in unusual and poignant ways. The violinist
brought his very best on Saturday evening: not a sin
gle note was left unaccounted for, as he accentuated
not just the clear musical cornerstones of each piece
but also the minute tonal details.

Such characteristic skill was made apparent early
on in the way Bell handled the cadenza at the end of
the program's first piece, Tartini's "Sonata in G Mi
nor." Cadenzas, short inserts composed by the artist
that exist for the sole purpose of showing off skill,

are generally dramatic affairs that the artist purpose
fully disconnects from the rest of the piece as a
demonstration of individuality.

Such overt validation of skill, however, was not
necessary for Bell. He stopped neither at the start
nor end of his cadenza, which consisted wholly of
double-stop chords and involved strenuous string
crossings.

As the piano ceased its accompaniment for those
few moments, the entire concert hall seemed to be
holding their breath as the sound of Bell and his
1713 Huberman Stradivarius fully filled the cav
ernous space.

Bell's performance of Tartini was energetic and
dramatic, perhaps reflective of a composition written
in response to a dream in which Tartini made a pact
with the devil. While the very feat of playing the
piece was meant to kill the violinist through pure ex
haustion, Bell handled the second movement, a fury
