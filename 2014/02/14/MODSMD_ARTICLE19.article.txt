# VIOLIN VIRTUOSO
## Joshua Bell dazzles Bing audience 
### ELIZABETH WOODSON 
Joshua Bell has been described as a "poet of vi
olin," a title he confirmed with gusto on Sat
urday night at Bing Concert Hall. Bringing life
and drama to a program that featured musi
cians from disparate eras, from Giuseppe Tar
tini to Igor Stravinsky, Bell ravished the sold
out audience in a show that lasted almost two hours.

Bell's world-class technique and stunning bow
control created an effortless connection of musical
lines in unusual and poignant ways. The violinist
brought his very best on Saturday evening: not a sin
gle note was left unaccounted for, as he accentuated
not just the clear musical cornerstones of each piece
but also the minute tonal details.

Such characteristic skill was made apparent early
on in the way Bell handled the cadenza at the end of
the program's first piece, Tartini's "Sonata in G Mi
nor." Cadenzas, short inserts composed by the artist
that exist for the sole purpose of showing off skill,

are generally dramatic affairs that the artist purpose
fully disconnects from the rest of the piece as a
demonstration of individuality.

Such overt validation of skill, however, was not
necessary for Bell. He stopped neither at the start
nor end of his cadenza, which consisted wholly of
double-stop chords and involved strenuous string
crossings.

As the piano ceased its accompaniment for those
few moments, the entire concert hall seemed to be
holding their breath as the sound of Bell and his
1713 Huberman Stradivarius fully filled the cav
ernous space.

Bell's performance of Tartini was energetic and
dramatic, perhaps reflective of a composition written
in response to a dream in which Tartini made a pact
with the devil. While the very feat of playing the
piece was meant to kill the violinist through pure ex
haustion, Bell handled the second movement, a fury

of four-string chords and too many trills to
count, effortlessly.
Bell also played Beethoven's "Violin
Sonata No. 10 in G Major," a piece com
posed half a century after the Tartini work. It
was a more lyrical and serene piece, culmi
nating in a surprising ending that left the au
dience in an ovation that lasted minutes.

The third piece in Bell's performance
was Stravinsky's "Divertimento for Violin
And Piano," inspired by Tchaikovsky, whom
the 11-year-old Stravinsky had the privilege
of seeing only two weeks before his death.
Passive listening was not an option dur
ing the performance Bell's powerful
presence was immediately enthralling. He
became one with the instrument, breathing
according to the ebbs and flows, peaks and
valleys of the musical landscape he was cre
ating.

It was thrilling, as an audience member,
to hear life breathed into the music as it bub
bles into being. Perhaps the best example of
Bell's presence was his conclusions. Whether
he whipped the bow across the instrument,
fully extending his arm as if wielding a sword
in the final blow of battle, or maintained the
bow's connection in perfect stillness, those
final moments of silence following each
piece's conclusion were sacred ground.
Bell received an immediate standing ova
tion after the designated program was com
plete. He graciously surprised the audience
by performing two more pieces: Rachmani
noff's "Vocalise" and a show-stopping piece
by Vitali. Another standing ovation followed,
and all that could be heard leaving the audi
torium were the awed responses from the
mesmerized crowd.
