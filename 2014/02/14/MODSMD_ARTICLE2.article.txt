## Tying the knot Undergrad couples plan for marriage amidst campus life 
### SEVDE KALDIROGLU 
To many people, and especially
to Stanford students, getting mar
ried or engaged while still in college
may sound like a crazy idea. For a
few Stanford undergraduates, how
ever, tying the knot during their
time here has been the right choice.

Overcoming challenges
Lexi Keck ' 15 and Kyle Pollock
'l4, who met through Cardinal Life,
a Christian fellowship on campus,
got engaged in December last year.
Balancing the planning of a wedding
with a normal student lifestyle
posed challenges, both acknowl
edged, but ultimately the additional
effort proved worthwhile.
"The commitment aspect and
the covenant aspect [of marriage]

are huge because that's what sepa
rates marriage from just a casual re
lationship," Keck said.

Hannah Boyd 'l4, who is en
gaged to Graham Thompson 'l4,
described the marriage process as
"challenging but exciting."
Boyd and Thompson met the
first day of freshman year in their
Program in Writing and Rhetoric
(PWR) class. They got to know each
other better through their church
and, after studying abroad together
in Cape Town, South Africa, decid
ed that they "had enough to know
that this was what [they] wanted
forever."

"I would say I've grown so
much through dating Graham," Boyd
said. "Either through the way he's

Pollock recognized their decision to get married as standing out from what he considers to be Stanford's casual hookup culture.

changed me or the way that the situation has
challenged me and made me grow. I wouldn't
trade it for anything."
For the engaged Katie Nelms 'l4 and
Luke Amuchastegui 'l4, challenges are a natu
ral part of the process.
"Basically, we're doing a life together now

it's not just what he wants to do or what I
want to do," Nelms said. "That comes with a
lot of compromise and sacrifice. Words that are
used in such negative ways can be really beau
tiful when you're doing them with somebody
and for somebody and when there is love and
trust."

Community reactions
According to Boyd, many people that did
n't know the couple well reacted negatively to
their announcement, expressing concerns that
they had rushed into the commitment at an
excessively early age.
"I think [their reaction is] mostly surprise
and excitement and then thirdly probably
maybe questioning," Thompson added. "Even
within our group of friends there has been
some... resistance to changeâ€”we've had

both good and bad."
However, the couples agreed that they
have ultimately met with a positive reaction
from the Stanford community.
"Stanford is a pretty open community and
I found it to be very true even in the situations
[where] people have to be open in a very dif
ferent way than what they are used to," Nelms
said.

"People are excited for us, but I don't
think they'd want that for themselves," Pollock
said. "They're kind of like 'Oh that's great for
you! I'm not at that place at all but I'm glad that
you're in that place.'"
Pollock framed the decision to get married
as particularly distinctive given the backdrop of
Stanford's "hookup culture."

"I feel like there is kind of a culture
against dating at Stanford at least serious
dating," Pollock said. "I think people are more
okay with something like hooking up after a
Friday night party."
"It really stems from not wanting as much
commitment [and] focusing more on success
and school," Keck added. "What I learned in
most of my classes are super important [but] I

think relationships have been the biggest as
pect of my time at Stanford."
According to Nelms, there are better ways
to do romance than common Stanford prac
tices.

"It's a time issue and taking the time to
get to know somebody and really care deeply
for someone that transcends the romance as
pect," she said. "I think that if people would
just care a little more and invest a little more
in the people that they're with, a lot of people
would have more and easier time dating and
getting to know each other."
While the couples have had a Stanford ex
perience largely distinct from that of the typi
cal student, most didn't mention anything oth
er than going out to dinner for Valentine's Day.
"I'm not a huge Valentine's Day person,"
Nelms admitted.

Her fiance, however, supported her by
giving the perfect answer:
"I think every day is Valentine's Day!"
Amuchastegui concluded.
