# HOUSE OF CARDS
## Second season of Netflix's hit TV drama released online today 
### ROXANNA REAVES STAFF WRITER 
Like you even really need a reason. You
don't need to be in Stanford in Govern
ment to appreciate the underhanded
dealings of this Netflix original TV dra
ma. With Season 2 set to be released to
day, here are four reasons to ditch your
date and stay in with a bottle of wine and the
Underwoods.

Underwoodisms

"House of Cards" wouldn't be the Emmy
winning breakout TV drama it is without those
one liners, the cruel gems of truth that Frank

Underwood drops right before he exposes
and exploits the vulnerabilities of his col
leagues.

'A great man once said, everything is
about sex, except sex. Sex is about power,"
Frank remarks at one point. Who knew cyni
cism is sexiest when spoken in a Southern
drawl? And it's all the more convincing when
Kevin Spacey is looking at you dead in the
eyes, letting you in on his little insights about
humanity. But then we quickly return to be
ing flies on the wall, peering into the inner
world of politics with voyeuristic delight. The
accent not only makes every word spoken
turn into gold, but it also helps make Frank
charismatic even while committing the most

atrocious crimes.

The Long Con
It's a beautiful thing. Watching Frank Un
derwood systematically manipulate everyone
around him even his own wife in order
to secure the Vice Presidency was incredibly
exciting. But is his constant scheming sustain
able? And what would happen if his most loyal
companions, Doug and Claire, decided they're
tired of Frank's egotism and ambition? I, per
sonally, would love to see a long con done on
Frank. While Zoe's a smart girl, such a con
could only be pulled off if someone Frank con-


Courtesy of Netflix
sidered trustworthy were involved.
Even Frank knows this, as he explains
in Episode 5: "Friends make the worst
enemies."

Since we know Frank's not com
fortable just being VP, either this sea
son or next we'll inevitably see a take
down of the current President, those
meddling kids at Slugline and any
body else that gets in Frank's way.
Claire
Can we just talk about her hair
for a second? I'm not saying Robin
Wright's portrayal of Claire Under
wood, Frank's equally conniving and
equally ruthless female counterpart,
didn't deserve a Golden Globe, but

Claire's consistently flawless bangs
and ultra-professional pixie cut played
a significant part in showing that she
"ain't no wifey". Plus, it doesn't hurt
to have something nice to look at in
the middle of all the show's ugliness.
Clearly the producers of the show
agree. Otherwise, it is hard to explain
why they would release a 30 second
pre-premiere teaser of Claire, alone,
taking a long seductive drag of a ciga
rette. Chiiiicks, man.

Obama's watching

Did you hear that? Your presi
dent is watching "House of Cards." In
fact, he's supposed to make a cameo
in the upcoming season. Yes, the
President of the United States of
America took a short break from, like,
pulling us out of Afghanistan and im
plementing foreign policy to be in
"House of Cards." He's admitted to

watching it and said, "I wish things
were that ruthlessly efficient... I was
looking at Kevin Spacey and thinking,
mmm well, this guy is getting a lot of
stuff done." Looks like maybe he's
even internalized some of Under
wood's self-motivation, considering
his promise to enact more executive
orders in the coming year.
But, long story short, if the Pres
ident has time to catch up on TVJ so
should you. This season appears to be
more cutthroat, twisted and jaw-drop
ping than ever. With 13 more hours
of political scheming scheduled to be
dropped on Netflix today, finding the
time to balance work with play this
weekend will be difficult. But, to take
it from Frank, "that's how you devour
a whale, Doug—one bite at a time."

"House of Cards." He's admitted to

watching it and said, "I wish things
were that ruthlessly efficient... I was
looking at Kevin Spacey and thinking,
mmm well, this guy is getting a lot of
stuff done." Looks like maybe he's
even internalized some of Under
wood's self-motivation, considering
his promise to enact more executive
orders in the coming year.
But, long story short, if the Pres
ident has time to catch up on TVJ so
should you. This season appears to be
more cutthroat, twisted and jaw-drop
ping than ever. With 13 more hours
of political scheming scheduled to be
dropped on Netflix today, finding the
time to balance work with play this
weekend will be difficult. But, to take
it from Frank, "that's how you devour
a whale, Doug—one bite at a time."
