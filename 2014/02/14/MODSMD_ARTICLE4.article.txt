# Q&A
## Professor gives love advice 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Professor Emeritus of Human Biology
Herant Katchadourian first taught HUMBIO
10: Human Sexuality in 1968, eventually
leading the course for more than thirty years
and teaching over 20,000 students in the
process. Katchadourian sat down with The
Daily to discuss his love advice for Stanford
students and his area of expertise: today's
hookup culture.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What was the
motivation behind starting your Human Sex
uality course? How did you first become in
terested in this topic?
Herant Katchadourian (HK): In the
late 19605, with all of the turmoil, [Stanford
University administrators] were concerned
about pregnancy, premarital sex and venereal
diseases, as we used to call them. They want
ed to cool things down... They came to me
and said this guy is a psychiatrist and so many
students know him, so therefore he would
be a good person for this [teaching the Hu
man Sexuality course],
I came the year after [to Stanford] and
offered the course for the first year and sixty
to seventy students showed up. The next
year, 400 students showed up and the third
year a thousand students showed up. We had
to move to [Memorial Auditorium],

TSD: What are your thoughts on today's
hookup culture? How would you describe
the evolution of the hookup culture? What
are its greatest dangers and is there away for
it to be replaced by something healthier?

HK: Part of me wishes that there was
such a thing when I was an undergraduate.
When I was an undergraduate at the Ameri
can University of Beirut, I couldn't get with
in shouting distance of the girls. In that sort
of starvation diet, hooking up sounds like
paradise if you accept fundamentally that
students now can do this responsi
bly, which means that they protect
themselves and their partner. The
second protection has to do with is
sues, elements of coercion. There
is this psychological pressure of
saying what's wrong with you and
if you come here as a freshman
from a very conservative back
ground, you don't want to be seen
as stigmatized as odd or square and
so on. This may be a weapon in the
hands of men who tend to be more
exploitative. They want to get what
they want and there may be a price
to pay but they are not paying the
price.

TSD: What do you envision the fu
ture looking like with regards to
human sexuality? How would hu
man behavior be different than
now and how would it be worse,
better or the same?

HK: In the future, what I don't
know is if... we are going to see
change in the psychology of men
and women in regards to sex be
cause so far a great deal has
changed. But sooner or later you hit
a brick wall. If evolutionary psychol
ogists are right, eggs are the largest
cells in the human body and there
are a limited number, so they are
like crystal goblets. Sperm are like
paper cups. So, when it comes time
to what do you do with your cup, a
woman wants to make sure that
this crystal goblet is going to end up
in somebody's hands who will nur

ture it and that can be trusted. So
women bank on quality; men bank
on quantity. If the primary driver is
reproductive strategy, meaning hav
ing as offspring as you can who will
in turn reproduce perpetuates your
genes. Men and women want the
same thing: they want survival and
they want to be represented in the
next gene pool, but the ways of get
ting there, the reproductive strate
gies are fundamentally different. If
this is true, this is going to stay like
this until the cows come home. We
are wired like that and evolutionary
time is hundreds and thousands of
years.

TSD: What three pieces of "love"
advice would you offer to an in
coming freshman at Stanford?
HK: I would say that don't do
anything impetuously and immedi
ately. Give yourself some time to
settle down. It's like a sailboat.
There's a strong wind here but
don't raise your sails before you
know what direction you want to
go. Don't be swept away.
Number two, examine your
own values, your own needs, your
own aspirations, your own desires
from a new perspective as you be
ing who you are, not simply a child
of your parents. For that, you need
to do what your head, your heart,
your conscience tells you to do.
This may or may not coincide with
how you grow up. If you are going
to hang on to your parents' values,
it should be by choice. Not by ge
netic or cultural enforcement.

Third, this [sex] is a very po
tent force. It can lead to a great
deal of happiness for yourself as
well as for the people you interact
with. It can also be degrading of
them. It is not a toy; it is a real gun.
You have to be careful that you
don't get damaged or damage other
people as a result of what you are
doing.

go. Don't be swept away.
Number two, examine your
own values, your own needs, your
own aspirations, your own desires
from a new perspective as you be
ing who you are, not simply a child
of your parents. For that, you need
to do what your head, your heart,
your conscience tells you to do.
This may or may not coincide with
how you grow up. If you are going
to hang on to your parents' values,
it should be by choice. Not by ge
netic or cultural enforcement.

Third, this [sex] is a very po
tent force. It can lead to a great
deal of happiness for yourself as
well as for the people you interact
with. It can also be degrading of
them. It is not a toy; it is a real gun.
You have to be careful that you
don't get damaged or damage other
people as a result of what you are
doing.

ROD SEARCEY/The Stanford Daily
Professor Emeritus of Human Biology Herant Katchadourian taught
HUMBIO 10: Human Sexuality for more than 30 years. More than
20,000 students took the course with Katchadourian.
Professor Emeritus of Human Biology
Herant Katchadourian first taught HUMBIO
10: Human Sexuality in 1968, eventually
leading the course for more than thirty years
and teaching over 20,000 students in the
process. Katchadourian sat down with The
Daily to discuss his love advice for Stanford
students and his area of expertise: today's
hookup culture.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What was the
motivation behind starting your Human Sex
uality course? How did you first become in
terested in this topic?
Herant Katchadourian (HK): In the
late 19605, with all of the turmoil, [Stanford
University administrators] were concerned
about pregnancy, premarital sex and venereal
diseases, as we used to call them. They want
ed to cool things down... They came to me
and said this guy is a psychiatrist and so many
students know him, so therefore he would
be a good person for this [teaching the Hu
man Sexuality course],
I came the year after [to Stanford] and
offered the course for the first year and sixty
to seventy students showed up. The next
year, 400 students showed up and the third
year a thousand students showed up. We had
to move to [Memorial Auditorium],

TSD: What are your thoughts on today's
hookup culture? How would you describe
the evolution of the hookup culture? What
are its greatest dangers and is there away for
it to be replaced by something healthier?

HK: Part of me wishes that there was
such a thing when I was an undergraduate.
When I was an undergraduate at the Ameri
can University of Beirut, I couldn't get with
in shouting distance of the girls. In that sort
of starvation diet, hooking up sounds like
paradise if you accept fundamentally that
students now can do this responsi
bly, which means that they protect
themselves and their partner. The
second protection has to do with is
sues, elements of coercion. There
is this psychological pressure of
saying what's wrong with you and
if you come here as a freshman
from a very conservative back
ground, you don't want to be seen
as stigmatized as odd or square and
so on. This may be a weapon in the
hands of men who tend to be more
exploitative. They want to get what
they want and there may be a price
to pay but they are not paying the
price.

TSD: What do you envision the fu
ture looking like with regards to
human sexuality? How would hu
man behavior be different than
now and how would it be worse,
better or the same?

HK: In the future, what I don't
know is if... we are going to see
change in the psychology of men
and women in regards to sex be
cause so far a great deal has
changed. But sooner or later you hit
a brick wall. If evolutionary psychol
ogists are right, eggs are the largest
cells in the human body and there
are a limited number, so they are
like crystal goblets. Sperm are like
paper cups. So, when it comes time
to what do you do with your cup, a
woman wants to make sure that
this crystal goblet is going to end up
in somebody's hands who will nur

ture it and that can be trusted. So
women bank on quality; men bank
on quantity. If the primary driver is
reproductive strategy, meaning hav
ing as offspring as you can who will
in turn reproduce perpetuates your
genes. Men and women want the
same thing: they want survival and
they want to be represented in the
next gene pool, but the ways of get
ting there, the reproductive strate
gies are fundamentally different. If
this is true, this is going to stay like
this until the cows come home. We
are wired like that and evolutionary
time is hundreds and thousands of
years.

TSD: What three pieces of "love"
advice would you offer to an in
coming freshman at Stanford?
HK: I would say that don't do
anything impetuously and immedi
ately. Give yourself some time to
settle down. It's like a sailboat.
There's a strong wind here but
don't raise your sails before you
know what direction you want to
go. Don't be swept away.
Number two, examine your
own values, your own needs, your
own aspirations, your own desires
from a new perspective as you be
ing who you are, not simply a child
of your parents. For that, you need
