## SHPRC increases student outreach 
### VANESSA OCHAVILLO DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
It's just a typical Tuesday after
noon at the Sexual Health Peer Re
source Center (SHPRC), as Milana
Baker 'l4 greets two visitors using
up their quarterly $3 credit for con
doms and rings up their purchases.
Sitting cross-legged on a swivel
chair in the SHPRC's office on the
second floor of Vaden Health Cen
ter, Baker, the center's projects con
sultant, explains that it wasn't al
ways this way the office used to
be much quieter. But she likes the
change of pace.

Structuring the organization
Since its founding in the mid
'9os, the student-led organization
has grappled with increasing stu
dents' knowledge about the center
and spreading awareness about sex
ual health.

"The institution is pretty old,
so it can get pretty complacent,"
Baker said.

Two years ago, Sophi Newman
'l3, SHRPC's director in both

2011-12 and 2012-13, decided to
break the stagnancy starting
with the condoms.

According to Newman, the
program initially struggled with a
supply problem. SHPRC found itself
backlogged on orders and putting
out an inconsistent product line.
"We were constantly chasing
after ourselves, always out of
stock," she said. "On a good day we
might have what you wanted, but
we were always running out."
They eventually switched to a
more reliable and current condom
supplier, Global Protection.
With supply no longer a prob
lem, Newman decided last year to
overhaul the organization's image.
Together with Baker and another
peer counselor, Newman helped re
design the center, turning it from
that "random place with a lot of
condoms" into a center that was
more welcoming with the intention
that students would visit frequently,
according to Baker.

"You used to come in and it
didn't feel professional. It didn't feel
safe," Newman said. "Because

we're providing people information
and providing items that are related
to personal health, I thought it was
critical that we maintain an aesthet
ic that was very professional."

A couch now sits near the
counselor's desk, encouraging easy

conversation, and assorted con
doms now sit in clear glass jars, re
placing cheap, plastic ones.

A new directorship
As a four-year veteran coun
selor, Baker has seen the SHPRC in

crease the number of events it
hosts in the last two years. Each of
the 28 peer counselors is required
to participate in at least one major
event each quarter, and many have

All Stanford undergraduate students have a $3 credit at the Stanford Health Peer Resource Center, where they
can purchase condoms, lube, toys and other similar items. The Center also offers peer counseling for students.
Student counselors have recently increased outreach efforts to promote awareness of sexual health on campus.
