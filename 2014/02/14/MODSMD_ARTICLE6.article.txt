# Revisiting Valentine's Day traditions

### VICTOR XU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's the morning of Feb. 14
and 13 students clad in suave red
jackets and khaki dress pants
crowd into a small dorm room,
where an enthusiastic couple is
waiting. One of the singers hums a
brief starting pitch before begin
ning the serenade a tender ren
dition of "Brown Eyed Girl."
No matter, as the couple soon

stops focusing on the singers, be
coming more interested in each
other's company than in the song.

Such is a common scene for
the Mendicants on Valentine's Day
every year, as the singers scurry
around campus from dawn to dusk
in order to perform a series of per
sonal serenades.

However, Valentine's Day on
campus features a number of other
traditions as well, from some based
on philanthropic efforts to others

founded on old-fashioned chivalry.

Music to My Ears

The Mendicants' Valentine's
Day serenades continue a decades
old tradition dating back to before
the 1980s. While the background
behind the Mendicants' first sere
nades has been obscured through
time, the performances are very
much in line with the group's his
tory and goal of "winning the
hearts of men and women alike,"

according to Chris Andrews 'O4, a
former Mendicant.
Serenades are available for
booking in the weeks preceding
Valentine's Day through online
signups. Starting early in the morn
ing, members of the Mendicants
begin their long day of crooning by
waking up their first clients with
boisterous song. The singers then
give the serenaded person a rose
before hurrying to their next per
formance.

With only about 15 minutes
for each serenade, including transit
and positioning time, singers skip
classes for the day and rush across
campus to make each gig. Some
times even entire-dorm serenades
are ordered.

"It helps show that [the client]
went the extra mile; they didn't
just buy chocolates or something,"
said Ben Isaacs 'l6, a Mendicants
