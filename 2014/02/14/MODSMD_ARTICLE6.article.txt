# Revisiting Valentine's Day traditions

### VICTOR XU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's the morning of Feb. 14
and 13 students clad in suave red
jackets and khaki dress pants
crowd into a small dorm room,
where an enthusiastic couple is
waiting. One of the singers hums a
brief starting pitch before begin
ning the serenade a tender ren
dition of "Brown Eyed Girl."
No matter, as the couple soon

stops focusing on the singers, be
coming more interested in each
other's company than in the song.

Such is a common scene for
the Mendicants on Valentine's Day
every year, as the singers scurry
around campus from dawn to dusk
in order to perform a series of per
sonal serenades.

However, Valentine's Day on
campus features a number of other
traditions as well, from some based
on philanthropic efforts to others

founded on old-fashioned chivalry.

Music to My Ears

The Mendicants' Valentine's
Day serenades continue a decades
old tradition dating back to before
the 1980s. While the background
behind the Mendicants' first sere
nades has been obscured through
time, the performances are very
much in line with the group's his
tory and goal of "winning the
hearts of men and women alike,"

according to Chris Andrews 'O4, a
former Mendicant.
Serenades are available for
booking in the weeks preceding
Valentine's Day through online
signups. Starting early in the morn
ing, members of the Mendicants
begin their long day of crooning by
waking up their first clients with
boisterous song. The singers then
give the serenaded person a rose
before hurrying to their next per
formance.

With only about 15 minutes
for each serenade, including transit
and positioning time, singers skip
classes for the day and rush across
campus to make each gig. Some
times even entire-dorm serenades
are ordered.

"It helps show that [the client]
went the extra mile; they didn't
just buy chocolates or something,"
said Ben Isaacs 'l6, a Mendicants
member.
Isaacs recalled a series of sere
nades last year where a student jok
ingly booked the Mendicants to sing
for his roommate five times
throughout the day. In past Valen
tine's Days, the group has even sung
for marriage proposals and to the
wives and husbands of professors
and deans.

Chivalry at its finest
A tradition specific to freshman
dorms is the practice of having
freshman boys roll out female dorm
mates on the morning of Valentine's
Day. Dressed in their finest attire,
the men generally wake up the
women at dawn and treat them to
flowers, chocolate and candy in a
traditional show of courtliness.

The rollout tradition varies by
dorm, however, especially given
concerns of the practice being het
eronormative and non-inclusive.
Marcelo Clerici-Arias, a residential
fellow in Cedro, said that he holds a
conversation with the Cedro staff
each year, talking about such issues
and collectively deciding how to
manage the tradition. Some years,
they follow the regular tradition of
boys rolling out girls, and other
years they choose alternatives.
Clerici-Arias said this year's staff de
cided to roll out the entire dorm, re
gardless of gender.
Stephanie Eberle, residential
fellow in Burbank, said that staff
members and dorm government
will often choose an alternative
event or make the tradition less het
eronormative.

"I think that, when all are in
cluded, it can really be a celebration
of 'Burbank love,"' Eberle said.

Candy Crush
While the sale and distribution
of "Crush Grams" by Kappa Alpha
Theta has also become a fixture of
Stanford tradition, its motivations
are based more in philanthropy than
in professing love to other students.
Crush Grams are cans of Crush

orange soda that are purchased and
distributed by members of Theta
the day before Valentine's Day. The
grams come with a note from the
sender and a bow, and are intended
as tokens of gratitude or admiration.
Kendall Cody' 15, chief market
ing officer for Theta, said Crush
Grams proceeds go toward the
chapter's weekly homeless feeds.
This year, the chapter sold 340
grams and raised $1,020, according
to Cody.
"I think it's an easy way to sup
port a good cause while showing
somebody that you care," she said.
Relay For Life began a similar
effort selling "Candy Grams," or
packages containing candy and an
optional rose last year. The pro
ceeds go to the American Cancer
Society for the purposes of educa

tion, advocacy, research and servic
es as well as a variety of other caus
es. The group has sold almost 600
Candy Grams this year, according to
Relay For Life Co-President John
Newcomb' 16.

"It's becoming a staple of what
we do," he said. "It's a good way not
only to spread awareness of cancer,
but also to raise money."
With practiced customs like
serenades and rollouts, and tradi
tions like Candy Grams forming
each year, Valentine's Day at Stan
ford promises old and new features
each year.

"It's a day to show appreciation
for the whole community and the
members in it," Eberle said.

Crush Grams are cans of Crush

orange soda that are purchased and

the day before Valentine's Day. The

as tokens of gratitude or admiration.
Kendall Cody' 15, chief market

Grams proceeds go toward the
chapter's weekly homeless feeds.
This year, the chapter sold 340

Relay For Life began a similar
effort selling "Candy Grams," or
packages containing candy and an
optional rose last year. The pro

Society for the purposes of educa

es. The group has sold almost 600
Candy Grams this year, according to
Relay For Life Co-President John
Newcomb' 16.

"It's becoming a staple of what
we do," he said. "It's a good way not

but also to raise money."
With practiced customs like
serenades and rollouts, and tradi

and 13 students clad in suave red
jackets and khaki dress pants
crowd into a small dorm room,
where an enthusiastic couple is
waiting. One of the singers hums a
brief starting pitch before begin
ning the serenade a tender ren
dition of "Brown Eyed Girl."
No matter, as the couple soon

stops focusing on the singers, be
coming more interested in each
other's company than in the song.

Such is a common scene for
the Mendicants on Valentine's Day
every year, as the singers scurry
around campus from dawn to dusk
in order to perform a series of per
sonal serenades.

However, Valentine's Day on
campus features a number of other
traditions as well, from some based
on philanthropic efforts to others

founded on old-fashioned chivalry.

Music to My Ears

The Mendicants' Valentine's
Day serenades continue a decades
old tradition dating back to before
the 1980s. While the background
behind the Mendicants' first sere
nades has been obscured through
time, the performances are very
much in line with the group's his
tory and goal of "winning the
hearts of men and women alike,"

according to Chris Andrews 'O4, a
former Mendicant.
Serenades are available for
booking in the weeks preceding
Valentine's Day through online
signups. Starting early in the morn
ing, members of the Mendicants
begin their long day of crooning by
waking up their first clients with
boisterous song. The singers then
give the serenaded person a rose
before hurrying to their next per
formance.

With only about 15 minutes
for each serenade, including transit
and positioning time, singers skip
classes for the day and rush across
campus to make each gig. Some
times even entire-dorm serenades
are ordered.

"It helps show that [the client]
went the extra mile; they didn't
just buy chocolates or something,"
said Ben Isaacs 'l6, a Mendicants
member.
Isaacs recalled a series of sere
nades last year where a student jok
ingly booked the Mendicants to sing
for his roommate five times
throughout the day. In past Valen
tine's Days, the group has even sung
for marriage proposals and to the
wives and husbands of professors
and deans.

Chivalry at its finest
A tradition specific to freshman
dorms is the practice of having
freshman boys roll out female dorm
mates on the morning of Valentine's
Day. Dressed in their finest attire,
the men generally wake up the
women at dawn and treat them to
flowers, chocolate and candy in a
traditional show of courtliness.

The rollout tradition varies by
dorm, however, especially given
concerns of the practice being het
eronormative and non-inclusive.
Marcelo Clerici-Arias, a residential
fellow in Cedro, said that he holds a
conversation with the Cedro staff
each year, talking about such issues
and collectively deciding how to
manage the tradition. Some years,
they follow the regular tradition of
boys rolling out girls, and other
years they choose alternatives.
Clerici-Arias said this year's staff de
cided to roll out the entire dorm, re
gardless of gender.
Stephanie Eberle, residential
fellow in Burbank, said that staff
members and dorm government
will often choose an alternative
event or make the tradition less het
eronormative.

"I think that, when all are in
cluded, it can really be a celebration
of 'Burbank love,"' Eberle said.
