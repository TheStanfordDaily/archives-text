# Flashback Friday Sherman weighs in on V-day tradition
## 
### 
In one of Stanford's most established Valentine's Day traditions,
freshman boys roll out their female dormmates early in the
morning of Feb. 14th and serenade them with songs, candy and
flowers. In 2007, however, this tradition prompted a heated se
ries of emails between West Lagunita residents upset by being
woken up early. At the center of the exchange was Richard
Sherman ' 10, All-Pro Stanford graduate and Super Bowl champion,
who expressed his opinion on the debate, according to Deadspin,
as follows:
To all You assholes complaining,
If you dint like it live in another dorm next year then be
cause tradition is tradition and If your Homosexual don't cel
ebrate the holidayy if its that big of a deal but im tired of yall
