# Stanford: The Business of Developing People?
## 
### Stephany Yong 
When talking about Silicon
Valley businesses, a friend
of mine categorizes tech
entrepreneurship into three buck
ets: the products, the ideas that
drive their production and those
who fund them. On Sand Hill, we
see this play out in a similar fash
ion: venture capitalists are in the
business of developing and fund
ing companies, while companies
are in the business of developing
products.

Of course, this naturally
points to a gaping hole in the anal
ogy: What about the people be
hind these ideas and investments?
Who has stakes in their develop
ment?

We naturally find ourselves
looking to Stanford, which has
been variously lauded and derided
for being a tech talent incubator
of sorts.

Here, it can be difficult to dis
cern where Silicon Valley ends
and academia begins. Some facul
ty members help build and advise
startups, while many professors,
armed with years of experience in
entrepreneurship and industry
come to teach classes about start
ups and the processes involved in
funding them. It isn't exceptional
ly abnormal for a student to take a
quarter's leave to focus on a proj
ect or work part-time at a startup,
the GSB or a venture firm.

We have Start-X on Page Mill
Road fostering a community for
student innovators to develop
their entrepreneurial skills and
products. Around the world, stu
dent entrepreneurial groups are
looking to build organizations sim
ilar to BASES (Business Associa
tion of Stanford Entrepreneurial
Students), which puts on its annu
al BASES Challenge competition

to provides mentorship and fund
ing for Stanford startups. (Full dis
closure: I work for BASES.)

We can even observe how
more "traditional" business
groups like Stanford Finance,
Stanford Consulting and the Blyth
Fund have partnered this year to
sponsor an entrepreneurial speak
er series one that, for example,
recently featured Eventßrite CEO
Kevin Hartz.

But you don't even need to
join a student organization to get
that kind of exposure. You could
be sitting in Old Union, minding
your own business, when some
one who could potentially help
you secure your seed funding
round takes a seat next to you.
What's most exciting about
Stanford being in the business of
developing people is just how en
trepreneurial the people have got
ten in the process: Students have
taken it in to their own hands to
create unique, individualized val
ues for themselves while at Stan
ford. Campus culture's emphasis
on experiential learning manifests
itself in the numerous startups,
business pitches and hackathons
that take place all the time.
That's not to say that success
is guaranteed. Before writing this
piece, I consulted with friends
who launched startups (with vary
ing degrees of success) on cam

pus. They've taken the renowned
design thinking and startup cours
es. They consulted with profes
sors and mentors throughout the
process, while some of them even
went through the BASES Chal
lenge or a student accelerator on
Sand Hill. Yet at the end of the
day, the overwhelming takeaway
was this: none of the theoretical
case studies and ideal practices
discussed in class have much
weight unless you go out, start
something and, more likely than
not, fail.
Stanford objectively does a
solid job in terms of developing
people through myriad channels
typically institutional relat
ing to faculty interaction and re
search. Stanford's remarkable abil
ity to develop people has less to
do with its tangible resources and
more to do with the people who
came here with the intention to
"join" this business and this
world.

These people internalized
the Valley's "Move fast, break
things," mantra they created a
safe space, with an abundance of
risk-takers and potential co
founders, where people can apply
in the real world the principles
our students learn about in tech
entrepreneurship classes but of
ten never seriously plan on apply
ing.

Stanford's business is to de
velop people, and its most effec
tive tactic is this exact self-improv
ing mechanism: it brings people
together, so that in the process of
learning, listening, and doing,
they develop each other.

products. Around the world, stu
dent entrepreneurial groups are
looking to build organizations sim
ilar to BASES (Business Associa
tion of Stanford Entrepreneurial
Students), which puts on its annu
al BASES Challenge competition

to provides mentorship and fund
ing for Stanford startups. (Full dis
closure: I work for BASES.)

We can even observe how
more "traditional" business
groups like Stanford Finance,
Stanford Consulting and the Blyth
Fund have partnered this year to
sponsor an entrepreneurial speak
er series one that, for example,
recently featured Eventßrite CEO
Kevin Hartz.

But you don't even need to
join a student organization to get
that kind of exposure. You could
be sitting in Old Union, minding
your own business, when some
one who could potentially help
you secure your seed funding
round takes a seat next to you.
What's most exciting about
Stanford being in the business of
developing people is just how en
trepreneurial the people have got
ten in the process: Students have
taken it in to their own hands to
create unique, individualized val
ues for themselves while at Stan
ford. Campus culture's emphasis
on experiential learning manifests
itself in the numerous startups,
business pitches and hackathons
that take place all the time.
That's not to say that success
is guaranteed. Before writing this
piece, I consulted with friends
who launched startups (with vary
ing degrees of success) on cam

pus. They've taken the renowned
design thinking and startup cours
es. They consulted with profes
sors and mentors throughout the
process, while some of them even
went through the BASES Chal
lenge or a student accelerator on
Sand Hill. Yet at the end of the
day, the overwhelming takeaway
was this: none of the theoretical
case studies and ideal practices
discussed in class have much
weight unless you go out, start
something and, more likely than
not, fail.
Stanford objectively does a
solid job in terms of developing
people through myriad channels
typically institutional relat
ing to faculty interaction and re
search. Stanford's remarkable abil
ity to develop people has less to
do with its tangible resources and
more to do with the people who
came here with the intention to
"join" this business and this
world.

These people internalized
the Valley's "Move fast, break
things," mantra they created a
safe space, with an abundance of
risk-takers and potential co
founders, where people can apply
in the real world the principles
our students learn about in tech
entrepreneurship classes but of
ten never seriously plan on apply
ing.

Stanford's business is to de
velop people, and its most effec
tive tactic is this exact self-improv
ing mechanism: it brings people
together, so that in the process of
learning, listening, and doing,
they develop each other.
