## On Opinion Articles 
### Patrick Cirenza 
Opinion articles are worthless. I
anything, they detract from the
fabric of society. When I read a
newspaper, I never read the opinions
section. Why would I? Opinion articles
are the value judgments of others in
which facts are selectively used, T is a
permissible pronoun, and reactionary
extremism is required to garner any
notice. The only prerequisite for writ
ing an opinion article is the urge to get
on a soapbox and opine. In the words
of Trish Hall, Op-Ed editor of the New
York Times, "Anything can be an Op-
Ed."

Yet in almost every newspaper in
the world, from high school papers to
The Wall Street Journal, there is
an opinions section. To understand
why, it is necessary to view the issue
through the lens of supply and de
mand. I completely understand the
supply side authors of opinion arti
cles are the type of people who love
hearing their own voices. Why not see
it in print? As long as vanity remains a
part of the human psyche, I suspect
there will never be a shortage of opin
ion articles.
What is more of a head-scratcher
is the demand side. Why do people
take time out of their busy days to
read purposeless articles like this one?
Today, I am contributing nothing to
you or your intellect. After reading
this article, you will neither be any
smarter nor more informed than you
were before you read it. I therefore
urge you to stop reading. With the ex
ception of the poor copy editor who
has to revise this, you have my full
blessing at this point to put down the
newspaper and walk away.
I posit (for those who are still
with me) that people read opinion ar-

tides because they are lazy thinkers.
Opinion articles are pre-packaged ar
guments and deductions, ready-made
for appropriation and subsequent use
at cocktail parties, in prison and in
other circumstances that necessitate
conversation for the sake of conversa
tion.

As a reader, if you agree with an
opinion article, you can mindlessly an
nex the argument and claim it as your
own without too much strain on the
brain. It is possible to think even less
if you disagree because of how easy it
is to disparage an article as simply
wrong without asking why.
On balance, this seems to be an
unhealthy practice. A robust mind
should always seek to form fresh opin
ions. That is why I advocate that you,
the astute and perceptive reader,
should read every other section in the
newspaper and develop your own
thoughts. Leave the opinions section,
a desolate wasteland of vacuous con
victions, to those who are unwilling to
ponder or reflect long enough to
come to their own conclusions.

If you have made it this far, I hope
you share my opinion that all opinion
articles are worthless and, indeed,
make our society as a whole worse
due to their sloth-inducing nature. In
the height of hypocrisy, however, I in
tend to perpetuate the problem and
will continue writing opinions for The
Daily. Thus, with the exceedingly low
bar I have just set myself, I will now
begin my weekly column in the opin
ions section.

As columnists go, Patrick Cirenza is the
quintessential rebel without a cause.
