## Jeter will be missed, even by Angels fan 
### Michael Peterson 
I hate the Yankees. Born and
bred an Angels fan, some of my
favorite sports memories in
clude the Angels' American
League Division Series victories
in 2002 and 2005—when I attended
the deciding Game Five —over the
Yankees. Few sports memories hurt as
much as the Angels' defeat in the 2009
American League Championship Se
ries to the Yankees.
But as a fan of baseball, I am devas
tated to see Derek Jeter leave.
Don't get me wrong, Jeter picked
the perfect time to retire —he's no
longer the player he once was. Even
though everyone knew Mr. Novem
ber's retirement would come soon, his
announcement still rocked the spoils
world.
In an era when baseball suffered
from rampant steroid use, Jeter played
the game the right way And in a time
when baseball suffered from a loss of
popularity due to the concurrent rise of
the NFL and the NBA, Jeter served
as baseball's face and kept it thriving.
Derek Jeter played for the world's
most popular baseball team, played on
baseball's brightest stages —winning
five World Series and appearing in 16
postseasons and played at the high
est level. But more importantly, he
played the right way.
Despite football players receiving
PED suspensions more frequently —
there have been 98 NFL players sus
pended for PED use since 2003 as op
posed to 44 MLB players—football is
rarely referred to as having a steroid
problem, whereas baseball was recent
ly considered as being in a "steroid
era." This "steroid era" stained base
ball's reputation more than perform
ance-enhancing drugs stained any oth
er sport.
Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting
streak, Hank Aaron's 755 home runs,
Cal Ripken Jr.'s 2,632 consecutive
games played, Pete Rose's 4,256 hits,
Cy Young's 511 wins and Nolan Ryan's
5,714 strikeouts are all revered records
(or in Aaron's case, formerly held
record) that define baseball. More so
than any other sport, baseball is a num
bers-driven game and the highest of
numbers are treated with the utmost
sanctity These statistics connect the
past and the present superstars.
In football, rule changes altered the
legitimacy of many records by shifting
the NFL game to a more pass-orient
ed attack. Out of the top 14 record
holding seasons for most passing
yards, only one season occurred before
2001. Matt Schaub and Matthew
Stafford have thrown for more passing
yards in a season than Johnny Unitas,
Joe Montana and Brett Favre, but you
will never hear them mentioned in the
same breath as those quarterbacks
again.
Tet in baseball, hitting in 56 consecu
tive games or collecting4,2s6 hits over a
career remain otherworldly and un
touchable achievements. A record
brings with it an immortal place in base
ball history—a history that extends
back farther than any of America's oth
er pastimes. Baseball's popularity
stems hugely from its connection to the
past and the chaw of superstars mark
ing their places in history
Steroids threatened the sanctity of
these records, and in the case of Hank
Aaron's home-run record, steroids de
stroyed the record. Barry Bonds
smashed 762 home runs in his career
and his name will forever be attached
to steroid use. The sacredness of base
ball was violated. Home runs became a
common sight after Sammy Sosa,
Mark McGwire and Bonds, all impli
cated in steroids scandals, laid Roger
Maris' single-season home-run record
of 61 to waste. Steroids also claimed
Alex Rodriguez, the youngest player to
hit 600 home runs and a three-time
MVP

Steroids wrecked the reputations
of some of baseball's brightest and all
time greatest stars. Yet, in the midst
of the "steroid era," Derek Jeter
shined.
Jeter has a flair for the dramatic
and made a career of postseason high
lights. He led off Game 4 of the Sub
way Series (the 2000 World Series)
with a home run and won World Series
MVP He hit a walk-off home run in
Game 4 of the 2001 World Series just
minutes after the clock struck mid
night and the calendar flipped to No
vember, earning him the nickname Mr.
November. And he made arguably the
most memorable single play of his
generation with "The Flip," which not
only contributed to a playoff victory
but also demonstrated the hustle and
grit that defined his career.
He accomplished all this while
