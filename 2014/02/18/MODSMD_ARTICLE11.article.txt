## CARD CAN'T BACK UP YOUNG PITCHERS, DROPS TWO 
### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
It's safe to say that No. 25 Stan
ford baseball and head coach Mark
Marquess missed Mark Appel 'l3 in
the team's opening series against
No. 15 Rice.
For the first time in his 38 sea
sons at the helm of the baseball pro
gram, Marquess sent three fresh
man starting pitchers to the mound
to open the season. That inexperi
ence, combined with an anemic of

fensive display and some sloppy de
fense, led to consecutive losses in
noncompetitive games: 10-3 on Fri
day and 5-1 on Saturday. Yet on Sun
day, Stanford seemed to send out a
completely different team both of
fensively and defensively, scoring 12
unanswered runs after the fifth in
ning to salvage a 12-3 comeback vic
tory.
For Friday's opener, the Card
tapped Ontario native Cal Quantrill
for the start. He became the first
Stanford freshman to start on

Opening Day since Mike Mussina
got the call in 1988, the last year
Stanford won the national champi
onship. Though some nerves in his
first collegiate appearance created
some early control issues, Quantrill
settled down over the course of the
day, demonstrating the poise he ac

quired over three years of pitching
in high-stakes games for UlB Team
Canada.
After a leadoff walk for Rice and
a fielder's choice, junior Skyler Ew
ing hit a line drive to right-center
field that was bobbled by Stanford
junior center fielder Austin Slater.
Rice senior Keenan Cook ended up
scoring all the way from first, and
the Cardinal quickly found itself be
hind 1-0. It was just the start of a

A Sunday home run by senior designated hitter Brett Michael Doran (right) was one of the few bright spots for the Cardinal offense over the
weekend. No. 25 Stanford lost two of three games to visiting No. 15 Rice and couldn't produce enough runs to bail out its freshman pitchers.
