# GROWING PAINS
## CARD CAN'T BACK UP YOUNG PITCHERS, DROPS TWO 
### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
It's safe to say that No. 25 Stan
ford baseball and head coach Mark
Marquess missed Mark Appel 'l3 in
the team's opening series against
No. 15 Rice.
For the first time in his 38 sea
sons at the helm of the baseball pro
gram, Marquess sent three fresh
man starting pitchers to the mound
to open the season. That inexperi
ence, combined with an anemic of

fensive display and some sloppy de
fense, led to consecutive losses in
noncompetitive games: 10-3 on Fri
day and 5-1 on Saturday. Yet on Sun
day, Stanford seemed to send out a
completely different team both of
fensively and defensively, scoring 12
unanswered runs after the fifth in
ning to salvage a 12-3 comeback vic
tory.
For Friday's opener, the Card
tapped Ontario native Cal Quantrill
for the start. He became the first
Stanford freshman to start on

Stanford won the national champi

first collegiate appearance created
some early control issues, Quantrill
settled down over the course of the
day, demonstrating the poise he ac

quired over three years of pitching
in high-stakes games for UlB Team
Canada.

A Sunday home run by senior designated hitter Brett Michael Doran (right) was one of the few bright spots for the Cardinal offense over the
weekend. No. 25 Stanford lost two of three games to visiting No. 15 Rice and couldn't produce enough runs to bail out its freshman pitchers.
host of defensive misplays
and errors for Stanford in the
game, which together ac
counted for five unearned
runs.

The Cardinal showed
some signs of life in the bot
tom of the second, when soph
omore right fielder Zach
Hoffpauir launched a three
run-bomb to left on a 2-1
hanging curveball. It was just
the third hit of Hoffpauir's
baseball career and gave him
his first three RBI, which put

the Cardinal up 3-1.
Yet the lead didn't last
very long. The Owls hacked
away with a run in the top of
the fourth after consecutive
two-out hits off Quantrill, who
had shown promise early in
the inning by mixing pitches
with strong placement.
In the top of the fifth, Rice
singled three consecutive
times off Quantrill and plated
one before the Cardinal sent
in another freshman righty,
Tyler Thorne. Thorne was
wild in his first collegiate ap
pearance and allowed a two
run RBI single to Ewing,
which gave Rice a 5-3 lead
that it didn't relinquish for the
rest of the game.

Quantrill finished with 71
pitches through 4.2 innings,
allowing five runs four
earned on six hits. He
struck out six Owls in the out
ing, proving that although his
low-90s fastball is not neces
sarily overpowering, his off
speed pitches especially if
thrown for strikes are es
pecially effective.
"I felt good. The heater
and the changeup both looked
good; I just left a couple up,"
Quantrill said. "Overall, it was
a pretty average outing."
Saturday's game, though
scoreless through six innings,
seemed like just as much of a
blowout, with Rice's offense
threatening nearly every in

ning and the Cardinal unable
to answer back with its own
offense.
Freshman Brett Hanewich
got the start for Stanford and
was hit hard in three-plus in
nings of work, allowing five
hits and three walks on 67
pitches. However, he was able
to work out of jams in each in
ning: Rice had two men on
with one out in each frame but
was unable to convert any of
its opportunities.
The Owls continued to
threaten in the next few in
nings with junior John
Hochstatter on the rubber
but were still unable to capi
talize. It took a solo homer
from Ewing to finally get the
team on the board, giving the
Owls a 1-0 lead.
The Cardinal had its best
opportunity to tie the game
up and possibly take a lead in
the bottom of the seventh,
when its first two hitters
reached base. Slater then laid
down a sacrifice bunt and sen
ior Alex Blandino was inten
tionally walked. However, the
potential rally was quelled

when the next two Stanford
hitters struck out on seven
pitches.
Such struggles in key situ
ations was indicative of the of
fense as a whole through the
first two games, as the Cardi
nal hit a meager .183 with just
two extra-base hits and 22
strikeouts in the first two
games in the series.
Sunday's game was cru
cial for the Cardinal, as it
looked to avoid being swept in
its opening series for the first
time since a 2007 road trip Cal
State-Rillerton.
After getting two quick
outs in the first, freshman
pitcher Chris Viall allowed a
single to right and then on a
high fastball, another homer
to Ewing, who went 7-for-12
with eight RBI in the series,
which gave the Owls an early
2-0 lead.
Viall continued to get hit
hard early, as even the outs he
was getting were hard-lined
shots to the outfield. Yet he
settled down and started to
throw his off-speed pitches
for strikes, and in innings
three through five, he allowed
just two base runners and
shut out the Owls to set up
Stanford's comeback.
"First couple of innings, I
was definitely a little bit nerv
ous, but I settled [in] pretty
nicely," said Viall, who earned
a win in his first career start.
"I learned very quickly that I
can't leave fastballs up."
The Cardinal offense
showed its first signs of life in

its opening series with a six
run fifth inning in which the
team batted around. Junior
left fielder Wayne Taylor and
senior designated hitter Brett
Michael Doran bookended
the scoring in the inning, each
with 2-run homers.
Stanford broke open the
game a couple of innings later
with four runs in the seventh
and two in the eighth. Hoff
pauir had a two-run shot in
the seventh over the left-field
fence and Doran, who got on
ly one start in the weekend
series, found away to make
the most of his chances, as he
was 4-for-7 with the RBI in
his pinch-hitting and DH-ing
duties.
"We have a lot of guys who
can play, including a lot of
guys on the bench who are
definitely capable players,"
Doran said. "So every chance
you get, you need to make the
most of it, and I was glad I
was able to do that today."
Moving forward, the Car
dinal will look to carry the of
fensive momentum it gained
in the final game of this series
to San Jose State, which lost
two of three to San Diego
State this weekend, on Tues
day at 6 p.m. The game will
be a small tune-up and a
chance to get back to .500 be
fore a trip to hostile Austin,
Tex. to take on No. 22 Texas
in a three-game set this com
ing weekend.
