The No. 6 Stanford women's bas
ketball team (24-2, 13-1 Pae-12)
rolled to two consecutive dominant
victories against its Pac-12 rivals
from Arizona over the weekend.
Coming off of a surprising loss
against the Washington Huskies last
week, the Cardinal regained focus
and bounced back to ensure that the
loss had not thrown them off track.
Friday evening, the Cardinal wel
comed the Pac-12's second-place
team, the Arizona State Sun Devils
(20-4, 9-3), into Maples Pavilion.
Playing after its first loss in nearly
three months a game in which it
allowed the Huskies to score 87
points â€”Stanford made a recom
mitment to defense that paid off
against Arizona State.

The Cardinal defense was sharp
from the opening tip, as it kept the
Sun Devils from scoring a field goal
in the first eight minutes of the
game. Fueled by disappointment
from its performance against Wash
ington, Stanford's intense defensive
effort held Arizona State to 24.2 per
cent shooting, the lowest of any Car
dinal opponent all year.
All-American senior forward
Chiney Ogwumike emphasized the
importance of the defensive side of
the ball following the Washington
setback.
