# CARD ROUTS ASU, ARIZONA

### LAUREN LOCKETT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 6 Stanford women's bas
ketball team (24-2, 13-1 Pae-12)
rolled to two consecutive dominant
victories against its Pac-12 rivals
from Arizona over the weekend.
Coming off of a surprising loss
against the Washington Huskies last
week, the Cardinal regained focus
and bounced back to ensure that the
loss had not thrown them off track.
Friday evening, the Cardinal wel
comed the Pac-12's second-place
team, the Arizona State Sun Devils
(20-4, 9-3), into Maples Pavilion.
Playing after its first loss in nearly
three months a game in which it
allowed the Huskies to score 87
points —Stanford made a recom
mitment to defense that paid off
against Arizona State.

The Cardinal defense was sharp
from the opening tip, as it kept the
Sun Devils from scoring a field goal
in the first eight minutes of the
game. Fueled by disappointment
from its performance against Wash
ington, Stanford's intense defensive
effort held Arizona State to 24.2 per
cent shooting, the lowest of any Car
dinal opponent all year.

importance of the defensive side of

Stanford junior guard Amber Orrange (above) led the Cardinal to a
pair of much-needed home wins against the Arizona schools, as the
squad bounced back from a surprising loss to Washington last week.
"Last week, we weren't
satisfied with our defense at
all," said Ogwumike to
GoStanford.com. "Defense is
a matter of will so we made
the commitment to play it re
ally hard. I told our team it
was a chance to be reborn and
start new, so I like the direc
tion we're going in starting
today."
Not only did Ogwumike
set the standard for defen
sive intensity, but she and
junior guard Amber Orrange
also led the team on the offen
sive end. Ogwumike posted 20
points and 13 rebounds for her
19th double-double of the sea
son, while Orrange got to the
basket easily and contributed
14 points (12 in the first half)
and a career-high five steals in
an impressive performance.
Led by 30 points from Ogwu
mike and Orrange, the Cardi
nal put the game away in the
first half, taking a 32-12 lead

into halftime.
"This game more than any
other, Amber really got on a
mission," said Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer to
GoStanford.com. "She was at
tacking, scoring really well.
This is the Amber we know
and love."
Following the Cardinal's
rout of the Sun Devils, the
Arizona Wildcats visited
Maples on Sunday afternoon
and suffered a similar fate, as
Stanford crushed the Wild
cats in a 74-48 victory.
Much like in the game
against the Sun Devils, Stan
ford was propelled by stingy
defense and this time, lots
of 3-point shooting. Though
the afternoon began with the
teams trading baskets, the
Cardinal put the game out of
reach midway through the
first half with a critical 25-2
scoring run. Junior forward
Bonnie Samuelson, who
knocked down five 3-pointers,
led the run on her way to a
team-high 17 points. Samuel
son became the first player
other than Ogwumike to lead
the team in scoring since the

second game of the season.
Ogwumike, who finished
the game with 15 points,
scored 11 duiing the run. Or
range also contributed anoth
er solid all-around perform
ance, adding nine points, nine
assists and five rebounds. The
team finished the game with
13 3-pointers, five short of the
conference single-game
record.
With Sunday's victory,
Stanford retained a firm lead
in the Pac-12 standings and
clinched a bye in the first
round of next month's confer
ence tournament. If the Card
maintains the physical, ag
gressive defense that it dis
played this weekend, its re
maining matchups should be
no problem.
With only four games left,
the team is beginning to close
out its regular season. Next
weekend, the team will travel
to Los Angeles for rematches
with the USC Trojans and the
UCLA Bruins, two teams that
it has already beaten.

of 3-point shooting. Though
the afternoon began with the
teams trading baskets, the
Cardinal put the game out of
reach midway through the
first half with a critical 25-2
scoring run. Junior forward
Bonnie Samuelson, who
knocked down five 3-pointers,
led the run on her way to a
team-high 17 points. Samuel
son became the first player
other than Ogwumike to lead
the team in scoring since the

second game of the season.
Ogwumike, who finished
the game with 15 points,
scored 11 duiing the run. Or
range also contributed anoth
er solid all-around perform
ance, adding nine points, nine
assists and five rebounds. The
team finished the game with
13 3-pointers, five short of the
conference single-game
record.
With Sunday's victory,
Stanford retained a firm lead
in the Pac-12 standings and
clinched a bye in the first
round of next month's confer
ence tournament. If the Card
maintains the physical, ag
gressive defense that it dis
played this weekend, its re
maining matchups should be
no problem.
With only four games left,
the team is beginning to close
out its regular season. Next
weekend, the team will travel
to Los Angeles for rematches
with the USC Trojans and the
UCLA Bruins, two teams that
it has already beaten.

The No. 6 Stanford women's bas
ketball team (24-2, 13-1 Pae-12)
rolled to two consecutive dominant
victories against its Pac-12 rivals
from Arizona over the weekend.
Coming off of a surprising loss
against the Washington Huskies last
week, the Cardinal regained focus
and bounced back to ensure that the
loss had not thrown them off track.
Friday evening, the Cardinal wel
comed the Pac-12's second-place
team, the Arizona State Sun Devils
(20-4, 9-3), into Maples Pavilion.
Playing after its first loss in nearly
three months a game in which it
allowed the Huskies to score 87
points —Stanford made a recom
mitment to defense that paid off
against Arizona State.

The Cardinal defense was sharp
from the opening tip, as it kept the
Sun Devils from scoring a field goal
in the first eight minutes of the
game. Fueled by disappointment
from its performance against Wash
ington, Stanford's intense defensive
effort held Arizona State to 24.2 per
cent shooting, the lowest of any Car
dinal opponent all year.
All-American senior forward
Chiney Ogwumike emphasized the
importance of the defensive side of
the ball following the Washington
setback.

Stanford junior guard Amber Orrange (above) led the Cardinal to a
pair of much-needed home wins against the Arizona schools, as the
squad bounced back from a surprising loss to Washington last week.
"Last week, we weren't
satisfied with our defense at
all," said Ogwumike to
GoStanford.com. "Defense is
a matter of will so we made
the commitment to play it re
ally hard. I told our team it
was a chance to be reborn and
start new, so I like the direc
tion we're going in starting
today."
Not only did Ogwumike
set the standard for defen
sive intensity, but she and
junior guard Amber Orrange
also led the team on the offen
sive end. Ogwumike posted 20
points and 13 rebounds for her
19th double-double of the sea
son, while Orrange got to the
basket easily and contributed
14 points (12 in the first half)
and a career-high five steals in
an impressive performance.
Led by 30 points from Ogwu
mike and Orrange, the Cardi
nal put the game away in the
first half, taking a 32-12 lead

into halftime.
"This game more than any
other, Amber really got on a
mission," said Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer to
GoStanford.com. "She was at
tacking, scoring really well.
This is the Amber we know
and love."
Following the Cardinal's
rout of the Sun Devils, the
Arizona Wildcats visited
Maples on Sunday afternoon
and suffered a similar fate, as
Stanford crushed the Wild
cats in a 74-48 victory.
Much like in the game
against the Sun Devils, Stan
ford was propelled by stingy
defense and this time, lots
of 3-point shooting. Though
the afternoon began with the
teams trading baskets, the
Cardinal put the game out of
reach midway through the
first half with a critical 25-2
scoring run. Junior forward
Bonnie Samuelson, who
knocked down five 3-pointers,
led the run on her way to a
team-high 17 points. Samuel
son became the first player
other than Ogwumike to lead
the team in scoring since the

the game with 15 points,
scored 11 duiing the run. Or
