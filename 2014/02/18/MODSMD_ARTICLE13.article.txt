# BROWN POSTS CAREER HIGH
## 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
Anthony Brown turned the
ball over on Stanford's first pos
session of the game. After that,
the senior guard couldn't do
much wrong.
Brown torched the Washing
ton State Cougars (9-16, 2-11
Pac-12) on Saturday afternoon
en route to a career-high 30
points, leading the Stanford

men's basketball team to a 69-56
road victory. It was the Cardi
nal's first win against the
Cougars in Pullman since Feb.
10, 2011, and it also marked the
first time Stanford swept the
season series against WSU since
the 2007-08 season. After the de
feat to Washington earlier in the
week, the Cardinal knew this
was a game it had to have.

Senior forward Anthony Brown (above) had 30 points when not
much else was going right for the Cardinal, as Stanford got an
important road victory at Washington State on Saturday.
"We felt like this game
meant more than us than it
did to them," Brown said.
"We had a sense of urgency
today and came away with
the 'W'"
Deadly early and often
for the Cardinal (16-8, 7-5),
Brown scored 20 of his 30
points in the first half. He
made all six of his field goal
attempts during the opening
frame, including all four of
his 3-point attempts. Stan
ford opened the game on a
19-8 run, and it was Brown
who was responsible for 14 of
those points during the first
seven minutes.
The Cardinal used
Brown's terrific first-half
performance to stake itself
out to a 15-point lead at half
time, one that it would use to
coast to its conference-lead
ing sixth road victory of the
season. Brown's first-half
performance was the first
time a Stanford player had
scored 20 points in a half
since Dwight Powell scored
20 in the second half against
UC-Davis on Dec. 15,2012.
"I just wanted to be ag
gressive, coming off the loss
against Washington," Brown
said. "I just came out, at

tacked; they left me open, I
got my rhythm going, and
then from there, once you hit
a few, it feels like the basket
is wide open."
Brown finished the game
8-of-10 from the field, 4-of-6
from beyond the arc and 10-
of-11 from the free-throw
line. It was easily the best
game of his Stanford career,
considering how much Stan
ford struggled to score oth
erwise.
Junior Chasson Randle
added 14 points for Stan
ford, the only other member
of the Cardinal to reach dou
ble digits on Saturday. Stan
ford was able to find success
despite by a poor shooting
night by attacking the rim
and stifling the Cougars' at
tempts on the other end. The
Cardinal shot 36 free throws
to WSU's 18, and held the
Cougars to shooting just
31.4 percent.
Particularly notable on
the defensive end for Stan
ford was the Cardinal's cov
erage of WSU's DaVonte
Lacy, an effort that was
spearheaded by Brown.
Lacy has been an explosive
scorer at times this season
but was quieted by the Card.
Coming off of a career-best
39-point performance
against Cal, he was held to
just 13 points on 4-of-12
shooting on Saturday.
Freshman Que Johnson

finished as the leading scor
er for the Cougars with 14
points, but he too struggled
from the field, finishing just
4-of-ll from the field.
The win marked the third
time this season that Stan
ford won the second game of
its two-game road trip after
losing the first, marking the
first time that has happened
since at least 1978, the first
season of Pac-10 play.
Stanford hopes that the
solid road victory will spur it
forward as the team moves to
wards the end of the confer
ence season. After the Cardi
nal takes on USC and No. 23
UCLA this Thursday at
Maples Pavilion, Stanford will
embark on a four-game
stretch in which it will play
teams ahead of it in the con
ference standings: Arizona
State and No. 4 Arizona. The
Cardinal wraps up the regular*
season by hosting Colorado
and Utah before the Pac-12
Tournament in Las Vegas.
As it stands today, the Car
dinal would probably be an
NCAA Tournament team.
But clearly, there is much
work to be done. If Stanford
hopes to see its name on the
bracket come March, the
Trees will have to grow some
more and reach even greater
heights.

ford opened the game on a
19-8 run, and it was Brown
who was responsible for 14 of
those points during the first
seven minutes.
The Cardinal used
Brown's terrific first-half
performance to stake itself
out to a 15-point lead at half
time, one that it would use to
coast to its conference-lead
ing sixth road victory of the
season. Brown's first-half
performance was the first
time a Stanford player had
scored 20 points in a half
since Dwight Powell scored
20 in the second half against
UC-Davis on Dec. 15,2012.
"I just wanted to be ag
gressive, coming off the loss
against Washington," Brown
said. "I just came out, at

tacked; they left me open, I
got my rhythm going, and
then from there, once you hit
a few, it feels like the basket
is wide open."
Brown finished the game
8-of-10 from the field, 4-of-6
from beyond the arc and 10-
of-11 from the free-throw
line. It was easily the best
game of his Stanford career,
considering how much Stan
ford struggled to score oth
erwise.
Junior Chasson Randle
added 14 points for Stan
ford, the only other member
of the Cardinal to reach dou
ble digits on Saturday. Stan
ford was able to find success
despite by a poor shooting
night by attacking the rim
and stifling the Cougars' at
tempts on the other end. The
Cardinal shot 36 free throws
to WSU's 18, and held the
Cougars to shooting just
31.4 percent.
Particularly notable on
the defensive end for Stan
ford was the Cardinal's cov
erage of WSU's DaVonte
Lacy, an effort that was
spearheaded by Brown.
Lacy has been an explosive
scorer at times this season
but was quieted by the Card.
Coming off of a career-best
39-point performance
against Cal, he was held to
just 13 points on 4-of-12
shooting on Saturday.
Freshman Que Johnson

finished as the leading scor
er for the Cougars with 14
points, but he too struggled
from the field, finishing just
4-of-ll from the field.
The win marked the third
time this season that Stan
ford won the second game of
its two-game road trip after
losing the first, marking the
first time that has happened
since at least 1978, the first
season of Pac-10 play.
Stanford hopes that the
solid road victory will spur it
forward as the team moves to
wards the end of the confer
ence season. After the Cardi
nal takes on USC and No. 23
UCLA this Thursday at
Maples Pavilion, Stanford will
embark on a four-game
stretch in which it will play
teams ahead of it in the con
ference standings: Arizona
State and No. 4 Arizona. The
Cardinal wraps up the regular*
season by hosting Colorado
and Utah before the Pac-12
Tournament in Las Vegas.
As it stands today, the Car
dinal would probably be an
NCAA Tournament team.
But clearly, there is much
work to be done. If Stanford
hopes to see its name on the
bracket come March, the
Trees will have to grow some
more and reach even greater
heights.

Anthony Brown turned the
ball over on Stanford's first pos
session of the game. After that,
the senior guard couldn't do
much wrong.
Brown torched the Washing
ton State Cougars (9-16, 2-11
Pac-12) on Saturday afternoon
en route to a career-high 30
points, leading the Stanford

men's basketball team to a 69-56
road victory. It was the Cardi
nal's first win against the
Cougars in Pullman since Feb.
10, 2011, and it also marked the
first time Stanford swept the
season series against WSU since
the 2007-08 season. After the de
feat to Washington earlier in the
week, the Cardinal knew this
was a game it had to have.

Senior forward Anthony Brown (above) had 30 points when not
much else was going right for the Cardinal, as Stanford got an
important road victory at Washington State on Saturday.
"We felt like this game
meant more than us than it
did to them," Brown said.
"We had a sense of urgency
today and came away with
the 'W'"
Deadly early and often
for the Cardinal (16-8, 7-5),
Brown scored 20 of his 30
points in the first half. He
made all six of his field goal
attempts during the opening
frame, including all four of
his 3-point attempts. Stan
ford opened the game on a
19-8 run, and it was Brown
who was responsible for 14 of
those points during the first
seven minutes.
