# BROWN POSTS CAREER HIGH

### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
Anthony Brown turned the
ball over on Stanford's first pos
session of the game. After that,
the senior guard couldn't do
much wrong.
Brown torched the Washing
ton State Cougars (9-16, 2-11
Pac-12) on Saturday afternoon
en route to a career-high 30
points, leading the Stanford

men's basketball team to a 69-56
road victory. It was the Cardi
nal's first win against the
Cougars in Pullman since Feb.
10, 2011, and it also marked the
first time Stanford swept the
season series against WSU since
the 2007-08 season. After the de
feat to Washington earlier in the
week, the Cardinal knew this
was a game it had to have.

Senior forward Anthony Brown (above) had 30 points when not
much else was going right for the Cardinal, as Stanford got an
important road victory at Washington State on Saturday.
