## SUPER TUESDAY "Compassionate Conservatism" and the Unemployment Debate 
### Josh Jones 
For weeks, President Obama
and the Democrats have been
fighting to restore extensions
to the Emergency Unemployment
Compensation program. But on Feb.
6, Republicans blocked the $6 billion
three-month extension in the Sen
ate, insisting that their amendments
and suggestions had not been con
sidered. The extension would have
increased financial assistance for the
unemployed from the standard 26
weeks to 63-73 weeks and has been
renewed by Congress every year
since 2008.
Since these extended benefits ex
pired shortly after Christmas, an es
timated 1.7 million Americans have
seen their checks stall at a time
when the national unemployment
rate hovers at 6.7 percent.
So whatever happened to "com
passionate conservatism?"
Many liberals, out of their sin
cere desire to help, are quick to de
monize 'heartless' fiscal conserva
tives that dare to question the effica
cy or legitimacy of social welfare
programs and the recent battle
over unemployment benefits has
been no exception. In January, Oba
ma denounced the failure to extend
unemployment insurance as "just
plain cruel." Senator Harry Reid
claimed Republicans wouldn't ap
prove unemployment insurance "be
cause they don't care." In response
to GOP objections to the bill, the
Senate Majority Leader scoffed,
"What [Republicans] want is to
know what the 57-year-old woman in
Nevada is going to do to stop couch
surfing."
But this is neither fair nor accu
rate.
For starters, even 'extremist' Tea
Party politicians have said they're
willing to extend unemployment
benefits if real spending cuts offset
the cost and other job-creating ini
tiatives are enacted. Trying a differ
ent approach, Senator Rand Paul
has called for "economic freedom
zones," a project that would dramat
ically decrease taxes in areas with
record-high unemployment in an ef
fort to incentivize firms to hire and
consumers to buy.
Outside of the Tea Party, Senator
Marco Rubio has called for stream
lining welfare funds back to the
states, which in the past have run
successful anti-poverty measures
such as job-training programs. Ru
bio said to CNN, "Our current pro
grams help people in alleviating the
symptoms of poverty ... but they
don't help people emerge from
poverty." He later added, "An unem
ployment check allows you to pay
the bills, and that's important. But
the only way to solve unemployment
is employment."
These are hardly the words or
proposals of insensitive Scrooges.
Rather, they highlight a crucial dif
ference of political ideology liber
als want to pool money and have a
small group of decision-makers in
Washington reallocate the re
sources; conservatives want to leave
more money at home and let local
communities and individuals solve
local problems. For all the dema
goguing, policy debates in D.C. are
largely about who should remedy
social ills and how, not if we should
solve them.
In the case of unemployment
benefits, many conservative law
makers seem to be asking: After five
years, is supplying over a year's
worth of unemployment checks still
a tenable emergency response, or is
it yet another Band-Aid solution that
allows us to avoid dealing with the
real problem?
America may be wondering the
same thing. A recent AP poll noted:
"Unemployment ranked near the
top of issues for the government to
tackle, at 42 percent. But only one of
the 1,141 adults surveyed mentioned
extending unemployment benefits, a
proposal that seems popular but not
highly important." The sad reality is
that many popular Democratic pro
posals help some while hurting oth
ers. In the case of the minimum
wage, for example, setting a price
floor above current wages reduces
labor demand and causes unemploy
ment, exacerbating the need for
measures such as unemployment in
surance.

Now, there's plenty of corruption
in government, and the elective na
ture of our system makes it difficult
to discern who is genuinely con
cerned with the general welfare and
who is simply accruing political capi

tal. I, for one, am no Republican
apologist. But to automatically label
all who question social welfare pro
grams as a bunch of self-righteous
misers who think the poor too stupid
or lazy to provide for themselves is
both a judgmental and counterpro
ductive approach.
True proponents of limited gov
ernment have great faith in the com
mon man so much, in fact, that
they reject the notion that an elite
group of central planners has the
right, capacity, or need to tell people
how to manage their money or be
better people. They believe that,
while life isn't fair or easy, govern
ment mandates dictated by the spe
cial interests aren't either (and
they're more expensive to boot).
True conservatives believe in
laissez-faire, not corporate bailouts,
special deals and crony capitalism.
Indeed, though conservatives and
libertarians are usually accused of
"trickle-down economics" because of
their commitment to lower taxes, it
is the big-government Republicans
and Democrats who insist that the
top-down, one-size-fits-all approach
of the federal government is the best
way to force the economy and socie
ty to run properly. Somehow, they
say, the money will filter through the
bureaucracy back to states, counties,
and individual citizens.
Believing government has the
power for good does not make you
an evil or unintelligent person. By
the same token, believing in solu
tions other than the use of govern
ment force does not necessarily
mean you are indifferent to the peo
ple or issues at hand. Binary 'right'
and 'left' political positions, polarized
and exaggerated by reporters and
talking heads, are often poor repre
sentations of personal desires, be
liefs and lifestyles. If we really want
less gridlock and more action, we
should take care when implying oth
erwise.
