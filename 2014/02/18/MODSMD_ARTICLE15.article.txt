# Addressing the Wounds of American Racism
## 
### Kristian Bailey 
The last time I wrote for The
Daily was to express my grief
over the acquittal of George
Zimmerman for his murder of
Trayvon Martin. The event that
sparks my return to a column is the
murder of yet another young black
person that has similarly gone un
punished. Last weekend, a Florida
jury could not come to agreement on
whether Michael Dunn was guilty of
killing 17-year-old Jordan Davis af
ter Dunn shot into the car Davis was
sitting in because Davis's music was
too loud. The jury did, however, con
vict Dunn of attempted murder of
the three other people in the car.
My reactions to this weekend's
verdict come from a much different
place. The Zimmerman verdict tore
open a sore that some of black Amer
ica thought was healing. One of the
women I worked with during last
summer summarized that feeling the
best: "What's critical for the black
community is this constant re
wounding of our place in the econom
ic, social and political order." And
having experienced a wound that cut
so deeply last summer, I am not sur
prised or disturbed by Dunn's ver
dict.
This outcome makes sense to me
given the reality of our social order.
As my friend said to me, we as a soci
ety have never dealt with the funda
mental traumas that slavery and Jim
Crow caused in this country and
the legacies of these traumas cascade
from generation to generation. We
have never dealt with the fact that
our government was at best compla
cent— and, more accurately, co-im
plicated — in setting up systems of
racism.
These unaddressed issues resur
faced Sunday evening when I re
watched "Fruitvale Station." The
film paints a very real picture of Os
car Grant, a 22-year-old who was
murdered by BART police on New
Year's Day 2009. The film spent the
majority of its time humanizing Os
car Grant, because, as a formerly in
carcerated, unemployed, young
black male with a history of selling

marijuana, his life tends to be other
wise predictable and expendable, his
story undeserving of sympathy and
outrage. Yet the film also humanized
his killer and the police who were im
plicated in Oscar's death. It is hard to
know where to place our emotions
when we realize that Oscar's story is
just one of many examples of racism
and the policing of black bodies, one
in which the cop who shot him was
just one of many agents of the state
that fail to serve and protect black
people and kill them instead. Michael
Dunn and George Zimmerman are
just two more examples of people
who take policing into their own
hands.
And so I will argue that just as
much as black society needs the time
and space to heal from our historical
wounds, non-black society is also
traumatized and is also grieving. To
live in a society that continuously
tries to forget the systemic violence
of its past is in itself a form of vio
lence against everyone who lives
within it.
No one is a winner in a world
where we're taught to fear black bod
ies, to define our experiences as hu
mans with "at least we're not black."
I am hard-pressed and I chal
lenge readers to come up with an
example of a non-black Oscar Grant
or Trayvon Martin or Marissa
Alexander or Renisha Mcßride.
I challenge readers to prove me
wrong and I charge that the reason it
is so hard for us to do this is because
blackness remains the thing most
feared in America. Non-black people
do not get shot for walking through
gated communities late at night or
for knocking on someone's front
porch and asking for help. This is not
to minimize the experiences of other
racial/ethnic groups, but to ask for an
honest acknowledgment that we all
retain a fear of blackness. It is a fear
that black people ourselves fall into;
it is a fear that I myself fall into.

I do not think Americans will ever
be "free" (whatever that means), un
til we deeply examine and tear out
the roots of our ugly history not

just against blacks, but indigenous
people and immigrants of all vari
eties. It is an unpleasant past and
present, which means the process
will not be comfortable or conven
ient, but it seems absolutely neces
sary for building and ensuring a fu
ture that is just for all of us.
Last quarter, the black communi
ty held a panel on the policing of
black bodies with Oscar Grant's
mother, his lawyer, the director of
"Fruitvale Station" and one of the
primary organizers working for Os
car's justice in Oakland. The words of
Dereca Blackmon '9l, the Oakland
organizer, really stuck out to me and
still resonate today. Recounting a
conversation from her time as an un
dergrad at Stanford, she recalled
having a self-identified rich student
ask her, "Why should I care [about
poor people]?" in a class on communi
cating across differences. Appreciat
ing his bluntness, she responded:
"You'll never be safe you'll never
be able to build enough fences to pro
tect yourself from the people you
don't care about."
So as remote as the murder of a
black 17-year-old might seem from
the Stanford campus, I encourage us
to recognize the many fences we
have around us: whether between
Stanford and East Palo Alto, be
tween residential clusters on cam
pus, or between us as students and
the people who keep the University
functioning through maintenance
and service. It is our responsibility as
people deeply embedded in power to
think about these things. We will nev
er exist in a truly safe world until we
take the time to care about and pro
tect those who are on the margins.
Those interested in the na
tional conversation on race
might he interested in hearing
Dereca Blackmon moderate a
conversation between civil
rights icons Elaine Brown and
Jesse Jackson this Wednesday
in CEMEX Auditorium.

majority of its time humanizing Os
car Grant, because, as a formerly in
carcerated, unemployed, young
black male with a history of selling

marijuana, his life tends to be other
wise predictable and expendable, his
story undeserving of sympathy and
outrage. Yet the film also humanized
his killer and the police who were im
plicated in Oscar's death. It is hard to
know where to place our emotions
when we realize that Oscar's story is
just one of many examples of racism
and the policing of black bodies, one
in which the cop who shot him was
just one of many agents of the state
that fail to serve and protect black
people and kill them instead. Michael
Dunn and George Zimmerman are
just two more examples of people
who take policing into their own
hands.
And so I will argue that just as
much as black society needs the time
and space to heal from our historical
wounds, non-black society is also
traumatized and is also grieving. To
live in a society that continuously
tries to forget the systemic violence
of its past is in itself a form of vio
lence against everyone who lives
within it.
No one is a winner in a world
where we're taught to fear black bod
ies, to define our experiences as hu
mans with "at least we're not black."
I am hard-pressed and I chal
lenge readers to come up with an
example of a non-black Oscar Grant
or Trayvon Martin or Marissa
Alexander or Renisha Mcßride.
I challenge readers to prove me
wrong and I charge that the reason it
is so hard for us to do this is because
blackness remains the thing most
feared in America. Non-black people
do not get shot for walking through
gated communities late at night or
for knocking on someone's front
porch and asking for help. This is not
to minimize the experiences of other
racial/ethnic groups, but to ask for an
honest acknowledgment that we all
retain a fear of blackness. It is a fear
that black people ourselves fall into;
it is a fear that I myself fall into.

I do not think Americans will ever
be "free" (whatever that means), un
til we deeply examine and tear out
the roots of our ugly history not

just against blacks, but indigenous
people and immigrants of all vari
eties. It is an unpleasant past and
present, which means the process
will not be comfortable or conven
ient, but it seems absolutely neces
sary for building and ensuring a fu
ture that is just for all of us.
Last quarter, the black communi
ty held a panel on the policing of
black bodies with Oscar Grant's
mother, his lawyer, the director of
"Fruitvale Station" and one of the
primary organizers working for Os
car's justice in Oakland. The words of
Dereca Blackmon '9l, the Oakland
organizer, really stuck out to me and
still resonate today. Recounting a
conversation from her time as an un
dergrad at Stanford, she recalled
having a self-identified rich student
ask her, "Why should I care [about
poor people]?" in a class on communi
cating across differences. Appreciat
ing his bluntness, she responded:
"You'll never be safe you'll never
be able to build enough fences to pro
tect yourself from the people you
don't care about."
So as remote as the murder of a
black 17-year-old might seem from
the Stanford campus, I encourage us
to recognize the many fences we
have around us: whether between
Stanford and East Palo Alto, be
tween residential clusters on cam
pus, or between us as students and
the people who keep the University
functioning through maintenance
and service. It is our responsibility as
people deeply embedded in power to
think about these things. We will nev
er exist in a truly safe world until we
take the time to care about and pro
tect those who are on the margins.
Those interested in the na
tional conversation on race
might he interested in hearing
Dereca Blackmon moderate a
conversation between civil
rights icons Elaine Brown and
Jesse Jackson this Wednesday
in CEMEX Auditorium.

The last time I wrote for The
Daily was to express my grief
over the acquittal of George
Zimmerman for his murder of
Trayvon Martin. The event that
sparks my return to a column is the
murder of yet another young black
person that has similarly gone un
punished. Last weekend, a Florida
jury could not come to agreement on
whether Michael Dunn was guilty of
killing 17-year-old Jordan Davis af
ter Dunn shot into the car Davis was
sitting in because Davis's music was
too loud. The jury did, however, con
vict Dunn of attempted murder of
the three other people in the car.
My reactions to this weekend's
verdict come from a much different
place. The Zimmerman verdict tore
open a sore that some of black Amer
ica thought was healing. One of the
women I worked with during last
summer summarized that feeling the
best: "What's critical for the black
community is this constant re
wounding of our place in the econom
ic, social and political order." And
having experienced a wound that cut
so deeply last summer, I am not sur
prised or disturbed by Dunn's ver
dict.
This outcome makes sense to me
given the reality of our social order.
As my friend said to me, we as a soci
ety have never dealt with the funda
mental traumas that slavery and Jim
Crow caused in this country and
the legacies of these traumas cascade
from generation to generation. We
have never dealt with the fact that
our government was at best compla
cent— and, more accurately, co-im
plicated — in setting up systems of
racism.
These unaddressed issues resur
faced Sunday evening when I re
watched "Fruitvale Station." The
film paints a very real picture of Os
car Grant, a 22-year-old who was
murdered by BART police on New
Year's Day 2009. The film spent the
majority of its time humanizing Os
car Grant, because, as a formerly in
carcerated, unemployed, young
black male with a history of selling
