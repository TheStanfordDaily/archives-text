# SUPER TUESDAY
## The
						Boots of Poverty Are Strapless 
### Nick Ahamed 
If you follow Stanford grad Cory Booker on
Twitter, you'll be well aware that federal unem
ployment benefits have expired. The bulk of
the program expired at the end of 2013, cutting off
almost two million people from its support.
The current federal program was initiated by
President Bush as an emergency response to the
2008 recession and its resulting unemployment.
Since then, Congress has voted 11 times to contin
ue it, never allowing one day with expired benefits.
What makes this time different?
The current debate is over a bill in the Senate
proposed by Jack Reed (D-RI). The bill proposes
to extend benefits for an additional three months.
Like most welfare programs, unemployment insur
ance is typically administered by states, and most
states have a limit of 26 weeks of benefits for an el
igible individual. The three-month federal exten
sion would support the 35.8 percent of unemployed
individuals who did not find a job in the first 26
weeks of being laid off, at a total cost of $6.4 billion
over ten years.
Yet, when the bill came up for a vote a third time
in early February, Republicans filibustered. There
was no vote to be had.
Originally, they said that the cost was too high.
After an amendment was added that cut spending
elsewhere (called a pay-for), Sen. Rob Portman (R
-OH) commented that the pay-for "put taxpayers at
risk," despite that a similar pay-for has been used
in past laws by both sides.
Other Republicans say that their voice is being

ignored in the process hardly a good reason to
deny two million Americans sustenance despite
the fact that the bill was co-introduced by Sen.
Dean Heller (R-NV). Likewise, Sen. Tom Coburn
(R-OK) inserted a sensible amendment that denied
benefits to millionaires.
Even if the one voted needed for passage in the
Senate is seemed, Speaker Boehner will likely
table it as he has tabled immigration, putting it on
ice for the foreseeable future.
However, denying people unemployment insur
ance is actually hurting the economy. Firstly, it
pushes people from a time-limited program to oth
er, indefinite ones, like Social Security and disabili
ty benefits, according to a Government Accounta
bility Office report. This often means the involved
individuals leave the economy, creating a false de
crease in unemployment. The Economic Policy In
stitute estimates that 310,000 jobs will be lost in
2014 alone as a result of the expiration.
Secondly, the government is injecting less mon
ey into a still-struggling economy. The Washington
Post reports that the expiring of benefits will cut
between two-tenths and four-tenths of a percent
age point from America's GDI) or between roughly
$3O and $6O billion (because those receiving bene
fits have very low saving rates). The money that
they get is money they spend, injecting it back into
the economy.
The same GAO report informs us that 40 per
cent of those who exhausted their benefits earned
less than $20,000 in 2012.
Additionally, many conservatives lump unem
ployment insurance together with their under
standing of the welfare state. They argue that
these programs create a moral hazard that is,
they discourage unemployed individuals from find
ing a job.
This argument likewise does not hold water.
State benefits run out after about six months. Fed
eral benefits, if extended, will allow them to run out

at nine months. Either way, there is a sunset on
benefits. This pairs well with the fact that unem
ployed individuals find a job by month eight, on av
erage.
Moreover, unemployment benefits do not incen
tivize individuals to lose their job. Indeed, only peo
ple who were let go through no fault of them own
are eligible.
Lastly, most states' unemployment insurance
programs pay less than 50 percent of what some
one was previously earning. Thus, some ask the
question: Can you live on $330 per week?
It seems easy, but the weekly cost of attending
Stanford is about six times that, at $1,840.

Republicans talk about the poor pulling them
selves up by their bootstraps. This is certainly a
lofty aim and one consistent with American individ
ualism. But more often than not, boots don't come
with poverty, especially not boots with straps.
Cutting off unemployment insurance cuts the
straps off two million more boots.
Congress should first pass this temporary ex
tension.
Then they should focus on making federal bene
fits a more permanent institution. This policy is
founded upon the principle that as a nation, we
should agree to give a helping hand to those
knocked down. This means that federal benefits
should be extended at least two months. The sys
tem should be structured such that hardworking
employed people â€”who therefore are paying into
the insurance system should, on average, not
have to go one week without money for food.
It seems that enabling individuals to get back
on their feet should be a policy that Republicans
and Democrats alike would stand behind. There is
more as a nation that we can do, but this is a good
start.
