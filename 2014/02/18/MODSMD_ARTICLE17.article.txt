## Aaron Bright to transfer to Saint Mary's 
### â€“ Do-Hyoung Park 
Two months removed
from a season-ending injury
that prevented him from
completing his senior season
with the Cardinal basketball
team, guard Aaron Bright
announced on Monday that
he will be transferring to
Saint Mary's College after
his graduation from Stanford
in June.
Bright is eligible to use a
medical redshirt for this sea
son to extend his eligibility.
He played only seven games
before dislocating his shoul
der in practice and electing
to undergo season-ending
surgery. In those seven con
tests, he averaged 5.9 points
and 2.3 assists per game.
The senior will likely start

at guard for the Gaels next
season after taking advan
tage of the NCAA's graduate
transfer rule, which allows
for players who complete
their undergraduate degree
at an institution before their
eligibility ends to transfer to
another school and play im
mediately instead of sitting
out a year.
Although it had been
known since his injury that
he would likely transfer from
Stanford, Bright hadn't an
nounced his decision to relo
cate to Moraga, Calif, after
the conclusion of his under
graduate degree until Mon
day. Bright, the MVP of the
2012 NIT, will leave Stanford
as the program's lOth-place
all-time rebounder with his
career total of 316.
