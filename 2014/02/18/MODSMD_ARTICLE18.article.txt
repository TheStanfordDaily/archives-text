# STANFORD STILL PERFECT
## 
### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Softball contin
ued its torrid start to the
2014 season, going 5-0
against the competition at
the Stanford Nike Invitation
al this weekend to maintain
its unblemished record.

Although No. 17 Stan
ford's performance from Fri
day to Sunday was not nearly
as dominant as its showing
last weekend in Tempe, Ariz.,
it was nevertheless an im
pressive display by the Car
dinal (11-0). More specifically,
on a weekend when No. 8
Texas A&M, No. 9 Nebraska
and No. 16 Baylor, among
other highly ranked teams,
all lost a least one game to
squads from "weaker" one
bid conferences, Stanford
succeeded where those other
teams failed by maintaining
its level of play and attention
to detail throughout the Invi
tational.

Several Cardinal players
really rose to the occasion
when the team needed a
boost. This was particularly
true for junior Erin Ashby,
who made winning play after
winning play both in the field
and at the plate for Stanford.
Ashby especially shined on
Sunday afternoon, when the
Cardinal had to outslug the
Pacific Tigers to win 11-9.
With her team leading 3-1
entering the bottom of the
fourth inning, Ashby provid
ed an immediate spark when
she blasted a leadoff home
run to left-center field. While
Ashby is normally known for
her patience at the plate, she

jumped on the first delivery
from Tigers starter Danni
Bonnet to hit a solo shot that
left Smith Family Stadium in
a hurry.
Later in the game, the
Card had an 8-5 lead in the
bottom of the sixth when
Ashby ultimately delivered
the final margin with a two
out, two-RBI double that
plated Kayla Bonstrom and
Kylie Sorenson. Finally, Ash
by took advantage of a mis
communication in the Pacific
infield to score the final run of
the game for Stanford. In the
end, Ashby finished the Nike
Invitational with a team-lead
ing three extra base hits
while sharing the high mark
in RBI (six) with Sorenson;
the Crescenta Valley High
School graduate also had six
runs, a stolen base and a .667
slugging percentage.
When asked to comment
on something that stood out to
her this weekend, Ashby
pointed to her teammates.
"The biggest thing was us
working together as a team
[by] coming out, putting runs
on the board, helping our
pitchers out as much as we
could and by collaborating as a
whole to win each game," she
said.
Kylie Sorenson also had
an outstanding weekend for
the Cardinal. The Stevenson
Ranch, Calif, native batted a
team-best .455 in five games,
while also drawing five walks
to post a tremendous .588 on
base percentage. After
jumping on opposing pitch
ers during the first day of the
Stanford Nike Invitational,
Stanford's opponents be
came very wary of pitching
to the talented freshman, as
Sorenson drew a couple of
four-pitch walks of the "unin
tentional-intentional" variety.
Sorenson made the most
of her three plate appear

ances in the Friday-afternoon
opener against Cal Poly. After
drawing a one-out walk in the
top of the first inning against
the Mustangs, Sorenson hit
an RBI sacrifice fly in the
bottom of the second inning
to give the Card a 4-2 lead.
Sorenson also capped off the
scoring in the 5-2 Cardinal
victory with an RBI single in
the bottom of the fourth in
ning. In the Friday nightcap,
Sorenson went 2-for-3 over
all, including a single and a
triple in the bottom of the sec
ond inning against Bradley.
Stanford scored seven runs in
the second and sent 11 batters
to plate to pace a 7-3 win over
the Braves.
"One through nine [of the
Stanford lineup] can drive the
ball, hit the ball out of the park
at any time, any day. It is su
per nice to have that," Soren
son said. "If you do not get the
job done... the girl behind me
is going to get it done."
Head coach John Rittman
was very pleased with his
team's performance this
weekend at the Stanford Nike

Invitational, a showing that
was rounded out by a 5-0 vic
tory over Bradley and a 6-2
win over Cal Poly on Saturday
afternoon.
"[The 11-0 start] says a lot
about our team," Rittman
said. "We are fairly young. We
have a lot of underclassmen
that are playing, a lot of fresh
men that are starting and a
young pitching staff. Getting
out to a great start is some
thing that we talked about."
"We know that it is a long
season, and this is just two
weekends into it, but we have
done a great job coming out
and getting ready to play," he
added.
Stanford travels on Tues
day to Davis, Calif, to take on
UC-Davis before heading to
Cathedral City, Calif, to par
ticipate in the Mary Nutter
Collegiate Classic this Friday
through Sunday. It will face
three ranked opponents at
that tournament, including
No. 2 Tennessee.
