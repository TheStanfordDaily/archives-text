# CARD DROWNS NO. 1 CAL
## 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
In the year after four-time Olympic
gold medalist Missy Franklin chose to
sign with Cal, the defending national
runners-up Golden Bears looked to be
unstoppable heading into the 2013-14
season. But this year, it was the No. 4
Cardinal (10-0, 7-0 Pae-12) that raced
through its dual meet schedule in away
that No. 1 Cal (7-2, 5-2 Pac-12) could not,
as Stanford capped off a perfect dual
meet season with a sinking of its cross
bay rivals, 167-133, on Saturday morning
in front of a packed Avery Aquatic Cen
ter on an emotional Senior Day.

"It wasn't pretty, in a lot of senses,"
head coach Greg Meehan told GoStan
ford.com. "I think both teams are strug
gling through some fatigue and are still
working hard as we gear up towards the
end of the season. But regardless, it was
great racing."
Although Franklin paced Cal with
easy victories in all three of her individ
ual events, the Cardinal ultimately pre
vailed with its deeper talent. Five differ

ent Cardinal swimmers won individual
events on Saturday as Stanford won 10 of
the 14 swimming events and split the div
ing events to earn a hard-fought victory
over the nation's top-ranked team. Only
Franklin and sophomore Elizabeth Pel
ton won individual events for the Bears.
Senior Felicia Lee, who was named
the Pac-12 Swimmer of the Month in
January for her perfect month Lee
placed first in all 14 events that she en
tered —won all four events that she was
a part of to top off a fantastic senior sea
son. She won every dual-meet event that
she competed in both individual and

relay after the Oct. 3 meet
against Washington State.
Although Franklin start
ed the meet on a strong note
for Cal by solidly winning
both the 1,000-yard and 200-
yard freestyle events, the
Cardinal earned a close vic
tory in the 200-yard medley
relay thanks to a powerful
anchor leg from junior Mad
dy Schaefer. Her split of
21.99 was nearly half a sec
ond quicker than that of Cal
junior Kaylin Bing, which al
lowed the Cardinal to grab
an exhilarating come-from
behind win.
From there, the Cardinal
took over the meet.
Lee held off a surging
Pelton in the 100-yard back
stroke to win by a margin of
two hundredths of a second,
junior Katie Olsen and soph
omore Sarah Haase con
tributed a 1-2 finish in the
100-yard breaststroke, sen
ior Maya Dißado sped to
victory in the 200-yard but

terfly and Schaefer and
freshman Lia Neal finished
1-2 in the 50-yard freestyle
to put the Cardinal solidly
ahead.
Although Franklin and
Pelton broke Stanford's win
ning streak with wins in the
100-yard freestyle and 200-
yard backstroke, respective
ly, the Cardinal took back
full control by winning the
last five events to end its
dual meet season with a
flourish. It was only fitting
that three of those events
were won by seniors, with
Taylor and Dißado winning
their final events in their
home pool at Avery and Lee
claiming another individual
victory before closing her
home career with a win in
the 400-yard freestyle relay.
Senior diver Stephanie
Phipps also closed her home
career on a strong note with a
victory in the 3-meter diving
event while placing in second
in the 1-meter diving event
behind the reigning Pac-12
Diver of the Month, Cal's
Anne Kastler.

Although the Cardinal fin
ished its dual-meet season
with an unblemished record,

the duals aren't necessarily a
great indicator of success in
the more important champi
onship meets due to the dif
ferences in format. Different
team strengths and weak
nesses are highlighted by
championship meets, and Cal
has traditionally been a much
stronger championship meet
squad than it has been a dual
meet squad due to its all
around depth and experi
ence.
The Cardinal will see just
how good Cal can be first
hand and attempt to
knock off the defending con
ference champions —at the
Pac-12 Championship meets
in Federal Way, Wash., from
Feb. 26-Mar. 1. As has been
the case in each of the last
three years, expect the top
spot to be fiercely contested
between the Cardinal and
Golden Bears.
"It has been a great four
years with my class and
couldn't have ended up on a
better note," Lee told
GoStanford.com, "but we still
have more to go."
