## Candidates vie for mascot title during Tree Week 
### EDWARD NGAI DESK EDITOR 
Auditions to be the 2014-15 Stanford Tree mascot
of the Leland Stanford Junior Marching Band
(LSJUMB) and kisser of hundreds every Full Moon on
the Quad began on Feb. 17 and will conclude this
week when LSJUMB rolls out one of the eight candi
dates vying for the job.
"There is only one position we introduce them to
the Band's management, they get to meet some of the
Band and old Trees from years past and learn about the
position," said Allison Crow 'l6, a public relations man
ager for LSJUMB.
Throughout the audition week, also known as Tree
Week, prospective Trees, or Saplings, aim to impress
the campus community with impressive stunts of all
sorts.
According to Roselyn Miller 'l6, another LSJUMB
public relations manager, potential Trees are tasked
with coming up with creative and memorable stunts
that will leave an impression on both the campus com
munity and the group of former Trees and LSJUMB
leaders who will determine who becomes the face of the
University.
"It's a chance for them to show off their creativity,"
Miller said. "We don't give them guidelines for what
stunts they should be doing."

Guidelines or not, Tree stunts overwhelmingly take
the form and character of the Band itself irreverent
and whimsical, while showing off a gratuitous amount
of skin. To that end, this year's candidates have a lot to
live up to the current Tree, Calvin Studebaker 'l5,

for a stunt.
On Monday, the first day of Tree
Week, candidates introduced them
selves to their evaluators. Stunts
yesterday included hijinks ranging
from mock crucifixion to a naked
surprise baked into a dildo-topped
cake.
Those were nothing out of the
ordinary, according to Band lead
ers.
"There were a lot of really in
teresting stunts, some involving
artistic creativity, some costuming,
some dancing," Miller said. "It was
a good introduction."
For Joanie Holberg 'l5, a candi
date for Tree, this opportunity is
one that comes around only once in
a lifetime.
"Thirty years from now, when I
look back on college, am I going to
think 'Wow, that midterm was so
nuts,' or am I going to think back
about being the Tree?" she asked.

"I want to be a part of the Band
community in away where I'm cre
ating the energy and acting in that
leadership role."
William Funk 'l6, another can
didate, stated his desire to keep the
tradition of the Tree alive.
"At the UCLA game this year...
a lot of the old trees were there
talking about the origin of the Tree
and its tradition and what it
means," he said. "I just absolutely
loved everything they were saying
and they convinced me to try out
for the Tree and made me want to
keep up this tradition."
