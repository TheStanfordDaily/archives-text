## Candidates vie for mascot title during Tree Week 
### EDWARD NGAI DESK EDITOR 
Auditions to be the 2014-15 Stanford Tree mascot
of the Leland Stanford Junior Marching Band
(LSJUMB) and kisser of hundreds every Full Moon on
the Quad began on Feb. 17 and will conclude this
week when LSJUMB rolls out one of the eight candi
dates vying for the job.
"There is only one position we introduce them to
the Band's management, they get to meet some of the
Band and old Trees from years past and learn about the
position," said Allison Crow 'l6, a public relations man
ager for LSJUMB.
Throughout the audition week, also known as Tree
Week, prospective Trees, or Saplings, aim to impress
the campus community with impressive stunts of all
sorts.
According to Roselyn Miller 'l6, another LSJUMB
public relations manager, potential Trees are tasked
with coming up with creative and memorable stunts
that will leave an impression on both the campus com
munity and the group of former Trees and LSJUMB
leaders who will determine who becomes the face of the
University.
"It's a chance for them to show off their creativity,"
Miller said. "We don't give them guidelines for what
stunts they should be doing."

Guidelines or not, Tree stunts overwhelmingly take
the form and character of the Band itself irreverent
and whimsical, while showing off a gratuitous amount
of skin. To that end, this year's candidates have a lot to
live up to the current Tree, Calvin Studebaker 'l5,

Saplings aim to impress the campus community during
Tree Week with stunts that incorporate candidates'
personalities, ranging from mock crucifixion to a
naked surprise baked into a dildo-topped cake.
