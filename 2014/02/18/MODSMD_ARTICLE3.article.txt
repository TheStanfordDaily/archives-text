## Lloyd, Whitfield officially switch to safety 
### â€” Do-Hyoung Park 
Stanford football announced on
Monday that sophomore quarter
back Dallas Lloyd and sophomore
wide receiver Kodi Whitfield will
be switching to safety for the start
of spring football and heading into
next season.
This announcement comes af
ter Stanford's depth at defensive
back was compromised at the end
of the 2013 season by the depar
ture of three seniors: Ed Reynolds
to the NFL Draft and Barry
Browning and Devon Carrington
to graduation.
Although it had been known
since late last season that Lloyd
had been practicing at free safety,
the announcement of Whitfield
joining him in the defensive back
field came as a surprise to many.
Lloyd will make the switch after
having started the season taking

limited snaps at quarterback, pre
dominantly in a change-of-pace,
read-option-oriented role with run
ning back Ricky Seale. Lloyd's
time spent under center decreased
throughout the season as he expe
rienced problems with turnovers
and starting quarterback Kevin
Hogan took over running the read
option. With freshman Ryan Burns
having redshirted this season and
top quarterback recruit Keller
Chryst joining the team next year,
the Cardinal's depth at quarter
back would likely have pushed
Lloyd into even more of a support
ing role if he had stayed at quarter
back.
Whitfield, as a converted wide
receiver, will bring a pair of good
hands to the safety position. His
phenomenal one-handed catch
against UCLA was one of the Car
dinal's premier highlights last sea
son. However, as the season went
