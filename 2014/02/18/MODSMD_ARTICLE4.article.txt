## Trail draws commuter backlash Proposed perimeter trail' may reduce commuter access to Dish 
### EDWARD NGAI DESK EDITOR 
As part of a countywide initia
tive to build walking and biking
trails, Stanford has proposed a
"perimeter trail" route that would
complete a network of regional
trails connecting the Arastradero
Preserve to the Bay.
In order to do so, Stanford has
proposed moving half of the 33 par
allel-parking spots on Stanford
Ave. to a parking lot on Coyote Hill
Rd., about a mile away from the
Dish gate. However, a group of
Dish commuters have mobilized to
protest the arrangement, request
ing that Stanford either move park
ing spaces closer to the Dish gate
or entertain opening new points of
access to the Dish trail.
The Committee for Dish Access,
the citizen group representing
those commuters who do not live on
or near campus, has alleged that
Stanford's parking plan serves to
restrict Dish access for commuters
and those who do not live or work in
the immediate Stanford area.
In an undated open letter, the
Committee wrote that "Stanford's
current proposal... can only be ex
plained as an effort to limit the
number of hikers and runners on
the Dish."
"The walk from Coyote Hill to
the Dish takes 15 to 20 minutes one
way," said Marcia Sterling J.D. 'B2,
the committee's chair. "[The pro
posed new plan] requires crossing
Palo Alto's busiest and most dan
gerous intersection. It has seven
lanes, commuters flooding in from
[Highway] 280 to the University ...
we feel it's very dangerous."
Sterling also attributed increas
ing car chaos on Stanford Ave. near
the Dish to the University's prior
actions, noting that the University
has increasingly limited parking on
residential side streets over the
last several years.
James Sweeney Ph.D. '7l, pro
fessor of management science and
engineering and president of the
Stanford Campus Residential
Leaseholders (SCRL), maintained
that Stanford is under no obliga
tion to accommodate the whim of
every community member that
chooses to hike the Dish. In fact,
according to Sweeney, Stanford is
not even obliged to open the Dish
to the public.
"Stanford originally made [the
Dish] available only for students,
staff and faculty," Sweeney said,
noting that the Dish and lands are
on private property. "Now, you
have people in the community say
ing, 'well, Stanford, if you let us use
the private property, you owe us
parking, you owe us bathroom fa
cilities, you owe us other ameni
ties.'"
At a Palo Alto City Council
meeting on Feb. 3, approximately
two dozen community members
urged city council members to take
sides on the debate. According to
Palo Alto Mayor Nancy Shepherd,
however, council members could
not respond because the com
plaints were raised during oral
communications.
"The city council has not taken
it up on agenda. It's not on our
work plan," Shepherd said.
Citing Palo Alto's bicycle and
pedestrian master plan, which
came before City Council in 2012,
Shepherd said there was no need to
re-evaluate City Hall's position on
the trail.
Trail construction a longstand
ing headache
The dispute over this half-mile
long stretch of trail is, however, on
ly the latest hitch in a series of de
velopment projects that have oc
curred over a decade and a half.
Larry Horton '62 M.A. '66, sen
ior associate vice president for gov
ernment and community relations,
said that the University's decisions
on Stanford Ave. cannot be separat
ed from the land-use issues sur
rounding the other trail develop
ment negotiations that have taken
place since 2000, when the Santa

Clara County Board of Supervisors
approved the Stanford University
General Use Permit (GUP). The
GUP placed conditions on Stanford
land use including the construc
tion of the perimeter trail in ex
change for approval to develop it.
Over the last 15 years, the Uni
versity has been negotiating with
the various stakeholders in GUP
imposed trail projects, including
Stanford community members, the
City of Palo Alto and the counties of
Santa Clara and San Mateo.
In a letter dated Aug. 29,2002, a
lawyer representing Stanford uses
the precise example of the Dish in
describing lands that, in her opin
ion, were not legally required to be
open to the public.
"While Stanford voluntarily pro
vides public access to areas such as
the Dish road, it controls that ac
cess," wrote Gordon Earle to Santa
Clara County planner Tim Heffing
ton. "Because neither Stanford nor
any other entity can know what the
future educational needs of the Uni
versity will be, Stanford believes it
is critical that it maintain the rights
over its land in order to retain suffi
cient flexibility to meet those needs

in the future."
Horton suggested that Stanford
may not have been clear enough
about who actually owns the land in
question.
"From 2000 to 2005, there were
extraordinary pressures ... to try to
get us to agree to an interior trail
[running through campus]," Horton
said, noting that any time the Uni
versity engages in land issues,
"[Stanford] would have to work
around the trail. We can't move
things around. It's for perpetuity.
It's forever."
Sterling, for her part, believes
that Stanford should try to look be
yond its legal concerns and look for
ways to benefit both those who can
walk to the Dish and those who
would prefer to commute to it.
"We support Stanford in a billion
ways," she said, referencing her
own standing as an alumna. "Some
of the folks who fought with the
county on this a decade ago still feel
concerned about someone trying to
take away their private land. I don't
think there's any risk of that."
