# Student dies battling cancer
## Lance Armstrong, others express condolences over social media 
### EDWARD NGAI DESK EDITOR 
Condolences have started to
pour in for the late Jimmy Fowkes
'l4, a religious studies major who
had fought reoccurring brain can
cer since age 13. Fowkes passed
away last week, aged 21.
Lance Armstrong, the former
professional cyclist and cancer
survivor who had forged a strong
relationship with Fowkes through
Armstrong's nonprofit organiza
tion Livestrong, expressed his
condolences on Twitter, writing a
message tagged #jimmystrong.
"Going into it, I think I was
just kind of alone and didn't know
anyone else with cancer," Fowkes

told The Daily in 2013, referenc
ing his initial involvement in Live
strong fundraising in 2006. "[Live
strong] was really the first time I
could meet other cancer survivors
and talk about their experiences."
Even when Fowkes' brain can
cer returned for a fourth time in
2011, he remained a full-time stu
dent at Stanford while undergoing
daily chemotherapy treatments.
Fowkes raised more than $230,000
for cancer charity Livestrong
since his initial diagnosis in middle
school, and also received the Na
tional Collegiate Cancer Founda
tion scholarship four times.
