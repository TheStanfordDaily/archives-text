## CDC launches new artfocused career trek 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
This spring break, the Career
Development Center (CDC) will
offer a new career-exploration
program focused on art and art
administration that will offer par
ticipating students exposure to
the San Francisco art scene for a
day.
Entitled "Art is My Occupa
tion," the program was created
through a collaboration between
the Department of Art and Art
History, the Stanford Institute for
Diversity in the Ails and the Stan
ford Arts Institute. Participants
will visit CounterPULSE, the
Asian Ail Musuem and the San
Francisco Arts Commision.
"We are very excited to offer
this arts-focused trek as there are
plenty of creative students and a

wealth of creative industries in the
Bay Area," said Liz Celeste,
gallery and exhibitions manager,
who will help lead students on the
trek. "I think it's important that
students get exposure to what dif
ferent careers in the arts can look
like."
The "Art is My Occupation" ca
reer trek will join a set of similar
offerings put on by the CDC, with
participants in each program
spending one or two days touring
various companies and organiza
tions in the targeted field. Accord
ing to program director Erin
Grant, organizations that are se
lected to be part of the career
treks represent unique facets of
that particular industry.
"We try to pick organizations
representative [of the sector] as a

whole," Grant said. "That way they
meet people that have different
roles and learn about what the job is
on a day-to-day basis, so students
can compare and contrast."
Grant also noted that by going to
the organization itself rather than
simply talking to representatives
while still on-campus, students get
to see what the workplace is like.
Students who had gone on the
trips expressed similar sentiments.
Bana Hatzey 'l4 attended the busi
ness-and-media trek that was of
fered last September in New York
City.
"As Stanford students, we don't
really get opportunities to do things
on the East Coast," Hatzey said.
"[The trip] was a really great
chance to see what things are like in
New York and have quality time
with recruiters. We all got to meet
each other and have networking
sessions."
Jeremy Schreier 'l4, who at
tended a "Both Sides of the Bay"
trek that focused on non-technical
careers in the high-tech industry,
said that he felt his choice of major
had been reaffirmed after attending
the trek.
"I felt very validated for study
ing at Stanford and felt like I could
get a really good job without being
in engineering," Schreier said. "The

skills you can get through studying
humanities and social sciences are
definitely valuable in these compa
nies."
According to Grant, students are
selected for each trek by a commit
tee consisting mainly of the faculty
members that organize the trip.
The 15 to 20 students that are cho
sen to attend the trips are support
ed completely by the CDC, with the
sole requirement that they pay a de
posit that would ensure their atten
dance.
The CDC recently moved the
deadline for "Arts is My Occupa
tion" to the end of the month
from an initial cutoff date of last
Monday â€”in order to encourage
more applications, according to Ce
leste.
Grant said she hopes that,
through the career treks, the stu
dents will be able to explore various
professional paths and opportuni
ties, as well as facilitating connec
tions between students, alumni and
participating organizations' em
ployees.
"I want students to think about
where they will be five or ten years
after graduation," Grant said. "The
vast majority of people get jobs
through networking, so I want stu
dents not only to understand the
value of networking but also how to
do it so they are better off when
they don't have the support that
they have [at Stanford]."
