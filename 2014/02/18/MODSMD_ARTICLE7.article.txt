### â€“ Madeleine Han 
Stanford led the nation's univer
sities in fundraising in 2013, bring
ing in $931.57 million over the
course of the year, according to a
survey conducted by the Council for
Aid to Education (CAE).
Stanford also led American uni

versities in fundraising in 2012, dur
ing which the University became
the first university to raise more
than $1 billion in a single year.
The 10 most successful fundrais
ing universities in 2013 raised 17.3
percent of nationwide contributions
between them. Last year's national
fundraising total $33.8 billion
marked a nine percent increase
over the previous year.
Stanford was also one of just
three universities to receive individ
ual donations of over $lOO million,
reflecting a $l5l million gift from
philanthropist John Arrillaga '6O.

Ann Kaplan, director of the
CAE survey, cited "medical re
search" and "arts programs" as po
tential reasons for large contribu
tions.
"If you're going to make a $lOO
million-plus gift, you probably have
a purpose in mind, and you're try
ing to be effective in a certain area
of social change or scientific re
search," Kaplan told U.S. News.
"Those are the institutions that
have the capacity to make use of
that kind of fund at that level."
