## Thawing the icy aura of the Winter Games 
### Ashley Westhem 
Every four year's, the same
debate persists around this
time: whether the Winter
Olympics are up to par with
the Summer Olympics. I'm
sure Norway and the Netherlands
would love to argue that winter is far
superior, and Jamaica and Great
Britain would beg to differ.
And then you have the United
States, which simply dominates all sea
sons of spoils and has incredible ath
letes at both Games. It doesn't matter
to us which season is more popular;
well put up a good fight in any sport.
The general consensus is that the
Winter Games are not as popular or as
entertaining as the Summer Games,
and the same arguments always come
up. I want to dismantle some of the
common critiques of the Games and in
stead offer a new one.
First off, there's the critique that
the Winter Olympics don't have as
many countries participating as in the
Summer Olympics. So that means a
slight cutting down on the amount of
fans that come to the Games, perhaps.
Okay that's valid. Only so many coun
tries have sno\y and that's a huge bar
rier weather-wise and money-wise
(winter gear is expensive!). But the Ja
maican bobsled team pretty much
strikes down the argument about
needing snow in order to compete.
The second argument against the
Winter Games is that it isn't as exciting
and there aren't many recognizable
names or teams. What about Shaun
White, Mike Eruzione and the 1980
men's hockey team, Apolo Anton
Ohno, Lindsey Vonn or Kristi Yam
aguchi? There may not be as many big
names, but they do exist.
And then there's the common gripe
with curling and how it makes the Win
ter Games laughable. As if table tennis,
badminton and trampolining don't fall
in that same category. I'm not putting
down any of those spoils; I'm just try
ing to make a point The one griev
ance that holds some water with me is
how all winter spoils generally blend
together: They all involve some form of
skis or boards or skates on top of snow
or ice with the intent of not falling.
The new critique that I want to of
fer is the way in which the winners are
determined. In the Summer Games,
there is a combination of time (swim
ming), scoring (soccer) and judging
(gymnastics) in determining the win
ners. Save for curling and hockey,
there is no scoring in the Winter
Games and it's skewed toward time
and judging.
This leads me to question whether
the best athletes in each sport actually
always win the gold medal. I don't
think so. Timed events are frustrating
because the fastest time might have
been the sloppiest-looking run, didn't
display much technical skill or wasn't
very impressive to watch, but still man
aged to get the job done. So the best
skier in the world might not win the
Super G because the gold goes to
someone who happened to be the best
in one particular race. That's the only
issue that I have with timed events
not that there's anything to really do
about it.
And then you have the events like
slopestyle, half-pipe and ice dancing, in
which judging sometimes seems total
ly arbitrary and something as trivial as
a person's outfit can affect the scoring
â€”points were deducted from a Russ
ian skater during a pairs performance
for a feather falling off. And that's espe
cially unfortunate for the partner who
didn't do anything wrong. Similarly, if
one partner falls and isn't picking up
the slack, it's frustrating for the audi
ence to watch and the other partner to
cope with. But that's a different topic
entirely related to team dynamics.
At least the ice-dancing judges got
it right when they gave Meiyl Davis
and Charlie White the gold. But then
there are other results which come out
much more controversial, like Canadi
an Mark McMorris getting bronze
when popular opinion said he deserved
gold for his run. It's all up to the judges.
And this is the same complaint that I
have with the Summer Games.
It's the politics and personal analy
sis of the Games, though, that make
them so intriguing to watch, and you
can get them out of both the Winter
and Summer Games. They each have
something different to offer to the au
dience and should be appreciated
equally.
