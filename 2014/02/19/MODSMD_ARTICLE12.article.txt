# FIFTH-SET STALL
## Cardinal winning streak stopped at four 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
Though No. 8 Stanford men's
volleyball team knew that Satur
day's match against No. 4 BYU
would be one of its toughest of the
season, confidence was not a ques
tion going in. The team was riding
a season-long, four-match winning
streak not only getting the re
sults, but also dominating its oppo
nents, not having lost a single set
over the streak.
The two teams battled through
out the match, trading sets, until
Stanford finally fell in a tough fifth
set, in which BYU started on a 6-0
run and never looked back. Ulti

mately, Stanford (8-5, 5-5 MPSF)
fell into a tie for eighth in the con
ference, while BYU (10-3, 10-1)
maintained its position at the top
after the five-set marathon, 25-22,
20-25,25-21,20-25,15-7.

From the start, it was clear that
the match would be a long battle to
the finish between two tough
teams. Stanford and BYU went
point for point during much of the
match, and it wasn't until the fifth
set that the Cougars gained a clear

advantage.
Senior outside hitter Brian
Cook led Stanford with 20 kills and
a .349 attack percentage, continu
ing his consistent leadership. Sen
ior outside hitter Steven Irvin also
had a strong offensive night with
17 kills and three blocks. Yet it was
Irvin's defense that was most im
pressive, as he tallied a match-high
13 digs. Senior opposite Eric
Moehalski was right behind Irvin
with 16 kills. Overall, Stanford had
a season-best 65 kills as a team and
outhit the Cougars .340 to .331.
While the Cardinal had a pow
erful offensive night, BYU was able

five-set loss to No. 4 BYU. The defeat dropped Stanford to a tie for eighth in the MPSF standings.
to pick up its defensive inten
sity and ultimately gain an
advantage over Stanford.
BYU outblocked the Cardi
nal 10-6 and stepped up in
the final set to push Stanford
into making some uncharac
teristic errors. Stanford's
normally strong service
game was surprisingly weak
with 21 service errors
four of which came in the
fifth set.
"That was a little unchar
acteristic for our team," said
head coach John Kosty of the
service errors to GoStan
ford.com. "I also think we
had a lot of good opportuni
ties to score points off our
serves. It is hard just to
point the finger at 21 mis
cues, but I am sure there
were a couple we would have
loved to have back."
BYU senior outside hitter
Taylor Sanders last sea
son's MPSF Player of the
Year had an incredible
performance with a season
high 27 kills and a .417 attack
percentage. He also recorded
four blocks for the night.
Sophomore setter Tyler
Heap had a double-double
with 53 assists and 10 digs.
And while both teams
played high-level volleyball
throughout the match, BYU
was able to limit its errors
and take advantage of mo
ments when the Cardinal
looked to be losing confi
dence. The Cougars were
able to take an early 6-0 lead
in the fifth set, and Stanford
was unable to come from be
hind. Stanford which had
looked hopeful throughout
the match seemed to be
affected by the pressure of
the final set. And in the end,
it was the Cardinal's unchar
acteristic errors that allowed
BYU to gain the last-minute
advantage and gain the road
victory.
Stanford will look to re
bound this weekend, but will
not face a break in competi
tion. No. 5 UC-Santa Bar
bara will make the trip to
Maples for a tough matchup
on Friday and the Card will
take on No. 3 UCLA after a
couple of days off in its first
Monday matchup of the year.

a season-long, four-match winning
streak not only getting the re
sults, but also dominating its oppo
nents, not having lost a single set
over the streak.
The two teams battled through
out the match, trading sets, until
Stanford finally fell in a tough fifth
set, in which BYU started on a 6-0
run and never looked back. Ulti

mately, Stanford (8-5, 5-5 MPSF)
fell into a tie for eighth in the con
ference, while BYU (10-3, 10-1)
maintained its position at the top
after the five-set marathon, 25-22,
20-25,25-21,20-25,15-7.

From the start, it was clear that
the match would be a long battle to
the finish between two tough
teams. Stanford and BYU went
point for point during much of the
match, and it wasn't until the fifth
set that the Cougars gained a clear

advantage.
Senior outside hitter Brian
Cook led Stanford with 20 kills and
a .349 attack percentage, continu
ing his consistent leadership. Sen
ior outside hitter Steven Irvin also
had a strong offensive night with
17 kills and three blocks. Yet it was
Irvin's defense that was most im
pressive, as he tallied a match-high
13 digs. Senior opposite Eric
Moehalski was right behind Irvin
with 16 kills. Overall, Stanford had
a season-best 65 kills as a team and
outhit the Cougars .340 to .331.

erful offensive night, BYU was able

five-set loss to No. 4 BYU. The defeat dropped Stanford to a tie for eighth in the MPSF standings.
to pick up its defensive inten
sity and ultimately gain an
advantage over Stanford.
BYU outblocked the Cardi
nal 10-6 and stepped up in
the final set to push Stanford
into making some uncharac
teristic errors. Stanford's
normally strong service
game was surprisingly weak
with 21 service errors
four of which came in the
fifth set.
"That was a little unchar
acteristic for our team," said
head coach John Kosty of the
service errors to GoStan
ford.com. "I also think we
had a lot of good opportuni
ties to score points off our
serves. It is hard just to
point the finger at 21 mis
cues, but I am sure there
were a couple we would have
loved to have back."
BYU senior outside hitter
Taylor Sanders last sea
son's MPSF Player of the
Year had an incredible
performance with a season
high 27 kills and a .417 attack
percentage. He also recorded
four blocks for the night.
Sophomore setter Tyler
Heap had a double-double
with 53 assists and 10 digs.
And while both teams
played high-level volleyball
throughout the match, BYU
was able to limit its errors
and take advantage of mo
ments when the Cardinal
looked to be losing confi
dence. The Cougars were
able to take an early 6-0 lead
in the fifth set, and Stanford
was unable to come from be
hind. Stanford which had
looked hopeful throughout
the match seemed to be
affected by the pressure of
the final set. And in the end,
it was the Cardinal's unchar
acteristic errors that allowed
BYU to gain the last-minute
advantage and gain the road
victory.
Stanford will look to re
bound this weekend, but will
not face a break in competi
tion. No. 5 UC-Santa Bar
bara will make the trip to
Maples for a tough matchup
on Friday and the Card will
take on No. 3 UCLA after a
couple of days off in its first
Monday matchup of the year.
