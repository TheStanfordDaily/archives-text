# FIFTH-SET STALL
## Cardinal winning streak stopped at four 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
Though No. 8 Stanford men's
volleyball team knew that Satur
day's match against No. 4 BYU
would be one of its toughest of the
season, confidence was not a ques
tion going in. The team was riding
a season-long, four-match winning
streak not only getting the re
sults, but also dominating its oppo
nents, not having lost a single set
over the streak.
The two teams battled through
out the match, trading sets, until
Stanford finally fell in a tough fifth
set, in which BYU started on a 6-0
run and never looked back. Ulti

mately, Stanford (8-5, 5-5 MPSF)
fell into a tie for eighth in the con
ference, while BYU (10-3, 10-1)
maintained its position at the top
after the five-set marathon, 25-22,
20-25,25-21,20-25,15-7.

From the start, it was clear that
the match would be a long battle to
the finish between two tough
teams. Stanford and BYU went
point for point during much of the
match, and it wasn't until the fifth
set that the Cougars gained a clear

advantage.
Senior outside hitter Brian
Cook led Stanford with 20 kills and
a .349 attack percentage, continu
ing his consistent leadership. Sen
ior outside hitter Steven Irvin also
had a strong offensive night with
17 kills and three blocks. Yet it was
Irvin's defense that was most im
pressive, as he tallied a match-high
13 digs. Senior opposite Eric
Moehalski was right behind Irvin
with 16 kills. Overall, Stanford had
a season-best 65 kills as a team and
outhit the Cougars .340 to .331.
While the Cardinal had a pow
erful offensive night, BYU was able
