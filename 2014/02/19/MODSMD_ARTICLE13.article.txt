## Offensive explosion spurs win Stanford at .500 ahead of Texas trip 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN DESK EDITOR 
During its opening series against
Rice, the Stanford Cardinal became
the only college baseball club in the
country to start three freshman
pitchers to open the season.
After last night's game, make
that four.

In its first Tuesday night contest
of the season, the Cardinal (2-2)
pulled away from local challenger
San Jose State (1-3) in a 9-3 victory.
The win at San Jose's Municipal
Stadium Stanford's ninth in its
last 10 games played there
brought its record to an even .500
leading up to a major showdown
with the Texas Longhorns (3-2) in
Austin next weekend.
Right-handed pitcher Tyler
Thorne, the fourth first-year hurler
in as many games to start for Stan
ford, rebounded well after a rocky
first appearance in Friday night's
season opener against Rice as a re
liever. Thorne earned the win
against the Spartans, pitching six
dominant innings in which he gave
up three runs —just one earned
on four hits and one walk.
Following Thome's strong six-in
ning performance, sophomore lefty
Logan James pitched two scoreless
innings in relief and freshman
righty Griffin Weir sealed the deal
with a scoreless ninth inning, strik
ing out Spartan pinch hitter Mitch
Ravizza to clinch the win for the
Cardinal. It was the second straight
game in which the Stanford bullpen
held its opponent scoreless after
giving up 10 runs six earned
in its first two games.
Though the final score reflects a
blowout in Stanford's favor, the Car
dinal at one point trailed 3-2 after
the third inning. But after scoring
the game-tying run in the fourth,
the Cardinal bats exploded with a
five-run fifth inning, highlighted by
a two-run double from junior center
fielder Austin Slater. Slater finished
the game 2-for-3 with three RBIs
and three runs.
Senior designated hitter Brett
Michael Doran, who got his second
consecutive start at designated hit-

ter, picked up right where he
left off on Sunday, going 2-for
-3 with a triple and three
RBIs. After just 10 at-bats in
Stanford's first four games,
Doran already has more
RBIs (6) than he did last sea
son (5).
Meanwhile, senior first
baseman Danny Diekroeger
had his second consecutive
three-hit game. Sophomore
shortstop and leadoff hitter
Drew Jackson and fresh
man second baseman Tom
my Edman also recorded
one RBI each.
The tremendous offen
sive output against San Jose
State immediately followed
the Cardinal's 12 runs
against Rice on Sunday, indi
cating that the Card's young
bats are still capable of
catching fire, even after sev
eral key departures follow
ing last season.
San Jose State struggled
to find consistent pitching
throughout the game, as all
but one of the five Spartan
pitchers who took the
mound gave up at least one
earned run. Starting pitch
er Carter Johnson left after
two innings with the score
tied. His immediate re
placement, Ross Slaney,
was credited as the losing
pitcher.
Behind the plate, the

Spartans also struggled to
mount a consistent threat.
All three of the San Jose
State runs early in the game
were sparked by Stanford
defensive errors.
The two errors for the

Cardinal defense raises a bit
of a concern for head coach
Mark Marquess and his
staff, as it marks the second
game of the young season in
which the Card has commit
ted multiple errors.

Stanford will next take
the field in Austin, Tex. on
Friday against a formidable
opponent in the Longhorns.
Following its three-game
weekend series against
Texas, Stanford will return

home to take on San Fran
cisco as it looks to prime it
self for Pac-12 conference
play.
