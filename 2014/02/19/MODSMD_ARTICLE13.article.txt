## Offensive explosion spurs win Stanford at .500 ahead of Texas trip 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN DESK EDITOR 
During its opening series against
Rice, the Stanford Cardinal became
the only college baseball club in the
country to start three freshman
pitchers to open the season.
After last night's game, make
that four.

In its first Tuesday night contest
of the season, the Cardinal (2-2)
pulled away from local challenger
San Jose State (1-3) in a 9-3 victory.
The win at San Jose's Municipal
Stadium Stanford's ninth in its
last 10 games played there
brought its record to an even .500
leading up to a major showdown
with the Texas Longhorns (3-2) in
Austin next weekend.
Right-handed pitcher Tyler
Thorne, the fourth first-year hurler
in as many games to start for Stan
ford, rebounded well after a rocky
first appearance in Friday night's
season opener against Rice as a re
liever. Thorne earned the win
against the Spartans, pitching six
dominant innings in which he gave
up three runs â€”just one earned
on four hits and one walk.
Following Thome's strong six-in
ning performance, sophomore lefty
Logan James pitched two scoreless
innings in relief and freshman
righty Griffin Weir sealed the deal
with a scoreless ninth inning, strik
ing out Spartan pinch hitter Mitch
Ravizza to clinch the win for the
Cardinal. It was the second straight
game in which the Stanford bullpen
held its opponent scoreless after
giving up 10 runs six earned
in its first two games.
Though the final score reflects a
blowout in Stanford's favor, the Car
dinal at one point trailed 3-2 after
the third inning. But after scoring
the game-tying run in the fourth,
the Cardinal bats exploded with a
five-run fifth inning, highlighted by
a two-run double from junior center
fielder Austin Slater. Slater finished
the game 2-for-3 with three RBIs
and three runs.
Senior designated hitter Brett
Michael Doran, who got his second
consecutive start at designated hit-
