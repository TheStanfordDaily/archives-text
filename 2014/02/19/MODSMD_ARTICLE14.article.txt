## Statement win to kick off spring 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
In the 2013 Peg Barnard Invita
tional, Stanford women's golf team
opened its spring season with a
bang, with then-freshman Mariah
Stackhouse setting a new Stanford
Golf Course record with an eye-pop
ping 10-under 61 as she shot 12-un
der for the tournament to almost sin
gle-handedly propel the Cardinal to
victory.
Although there were no individual
heroics from the sophomore in this
past weekend's edition of Peg
Barnard, the No. 5 Cardinal's more
balanced top five allowed it to spread
out the load and boost it to a second
consecutive comfortable win at the In
vitational over a field that included
No. 17 Oregon and No. 26 California.
"This was a strong, convincing win
for our team," said head coach Anne
Walker. "There were a couple of
strong teams in the field and we beat
them by a large margin. That feels
good."
The most significant factors in the
Cardinal's 16-stroke margin of victory
were standout performances from
sophomore Lauren Kim and fresh
man Casey Danielson, who finished
tied for second individually with
marks of 3-under 139 for the tourna
ment. Although Kim finished with an
even-par 71 and Danielson was just 1-
under 70 after the first day of the two
day tournament, both underclassmen
finished strong by finishing
under 70 strokes on the sec
ond day.
One of the key elements
in the strong second-round
performances of both Kim
and Danielson was good exe
cution on the long par-5
holes namely, the first,
seventh and 12th holes.
Danielson particularly stood
out in that regard, as she
birdied the first and 12th
holes in both rounds and
birdied the seventh in the
second round. She also cut
down on her bogeys on the
par-4 holes after the first
round.
Kim also birdied the sev
enth and 12th holes, as well
as the shorter fourth and
fifth holes to finish at 3-un
der 68 in the second round,
which tied the eventual indi
vidual winner, Dana Finkel
stein of UNLVf for the best
showing on Sunday.
"They were terrific this
weekend," Walker said. "I'm
not surprised by either of
their performances; it has
just been a matter of time.
You will see a lot more of
them this spring."
While Stackhouse didn't
have a performance that was
quite on par with that of her
record-breaking effort last
season in this event, she still
finished the tournament un
der par, at 1-under 141, to
finish tied for fourth individ
ually. However, the relatively
even performance is far
from what Stanford fans
have come to expect from
the star, who admitted to
struggling in the first round,
in which she finished at an
even-par 71 on familiar
grounds at the Stanford Golf
Course.
"Today was definitely a
grind," said Stackhouse af
ter the first round of play. "I
couldn't quite find a rhythm,
and I was definitely scram
bling a lot to save par."
"This wasn't Mariah's
best ball-striking weekend,"
Walker added. "But yet
again, she finished under
par. She has a unique ability
to dig deep and make birdies

even on her toughest of
days. She is an amazing com
petitor."
Freshman Quirine
Eijkenboom and junior
Mariko Tumangan rounded
out the Cardinal's top five
for the tournament, with
senior Marissa Mar, senior
Danielle Frasier and fresh
man Jisoo Keel also compet
ing in the tournament as in
dividuals. Neither Tuman
gan nor Frasier improved on
their scores from the tour
nament from last year, but

all of the Cardinal players
that competed, especially
the freshmen, showed the
ability to provide strong
support for the top five if
needed.
The Cardinal will next
head to Santa Ana, Calif, for
the UC-Irvine Invitational
against another relatively
weak field highlighted by
No. 11 Pepperdine on Mon
day and Tuesday.
