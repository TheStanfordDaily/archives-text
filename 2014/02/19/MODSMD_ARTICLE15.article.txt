### DYLAN FUGEL STAFF WRITER 
No. 2 Stanford women's water
polo (7-0) continued its winning
streak at a serene and untroubled
pace, as the Cardinal extended its
perfect start to the season with
two comfortable road victories
over the No. 14 UC-Davis Aggies
(8-7) and the Pacific Tigers (4-7).
The now-humming Stanford ma
chine has started to look more
and more dangerous as it gears
up for the meat of its conference
schedule, again sending a mes
sage to the rest of the MPSF that

The weekend's play got off to a
successful start as Stanford
cruised to a 15-4 victory over Pa
cific in a display that was impres
sive for the clinical way in which it
was carried out. The Cardinal
scored 13 unanswered goals be
fore the Tigers could even get on
the score sheet before easing off

of the gas and allowing a late flur
ry of Pacific goals.
The Cardinal was led by fresh
man defender Dani Jackovich,
who scored four goals, and senior
two-meter Annika Dries, who net
ted her second hat trick in as
many games. Junior driver Kiley
Neushul, although unable to con
tinue the torrid pace that she had
at the start of the season, also
chipped in with two goals.
The weekend doubleheader
then continued with the Cardinal
traveling to UC-Davis, which the

this year's team is not one to be
trifled with.
