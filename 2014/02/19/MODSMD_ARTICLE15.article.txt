No. 2 Stanford women's water
polo (7-0) continued its winning
streak at a serene and untroubled
pace, as the Cardinal extended its
perfect start to the season with
two comfortable road victories
over the No. 14 UC-Davis Aggies
(8-7) and the Pacific Tigers (4-7).
The now-humming Stanford ma
chine has started to look more
and more dangerous as it gears
up for the meat of its conference
schedule, again sending a mes
sage to the rest of the MPSF that

The weekend's play got off to a
successful start as Stanford
cruised to a 15-4 victory over Pa
cific in a display that was impres
sive for the clinical way in which it
was carried out. The Cardinal
scored 13 unanswered goals be
fore the Tigers could even get on
the score sheet before easing off

of the gas and allowing a late flur
ry of Pacific goals.
The Cardinal was led by fresh
man defender Dani Jackovich,
who scored four goals, and senior
two-meter Annika Dries, who net
ted her second hat trick in as
many games. Junior driver Kiley
Neushul, although unable to con
tinue the torrid pace that she had
at the start of the season, also
chipped in with two goals.
The weekend doubleheader
then continued with the Cardinal
traveling to UC-Davis, which the

this year's team is not one to be
trifled with.

Senior two-meter Annika Dries (right) was named the MPSF/KAP7 Player of the Week after scoring 12
goals over the team's last three matches. She currently leads Stanford with 19 goals on the season.
Cardinal previously defeat
ed 16-3 in the group stage of
the Stanford Invitational on
Feb. 1. Sunday's perform
ance was equally as compre
hensive.
The Cardinal got out to a
9-0 lead in the first two peri
ods, giving it a stranglehold
on the game that it did not
relinquish. That lead was
created by the goal-scoring
prowess of Stanford's two
meter players: Dries and
junior Ashley Grossman.
Both Grossman and
Dries scored two goals in the
first period, with Grossman
completing her hat trick
midway through the second
period. Freshman defender
Sophia Monaghan and fresh
man driver Jamie Neushul
also got on the score sheet in
this period, with both con
tributing to what became an
unassailable lead.
UC-Davis fought back in
the latter two periods
through a brace from senior

two-meter Alex Rawlinson
and junior center Elsie
Fullerton, but was not able
to make serious inroads
against a defensively sound
Stanford team that current
ly ranks second in the MPSF
with just 5.17 goals allowed
per game.
The 17-5 margin was well
deserved with the Cardinal
being paced by Dries, who
netted 6 goals for the game
in what was her highest
scoring performance of the
season. She currently leads
the team with 19 goals. The
whole team got in on the act
over the course of the day,
however, with 10 separate
Cardinal players scoring
goals.
Dries was announced as
the second Stanford player
this year to become the
MPSF/KAP7 Player of the

Week after her team-high 12
goals over the three games
against UC-Santa Clara,
UC-Davis and Pacific. Her
2.71 goals per game current
ly place her at fifth in the
MPSF.
Stanford's next set of
matches is set for this com
ing weekend, as it travels to
UC-Irvine for the Irvine In
vitational, another popular
preseason tournament. The
Cardinal will play Pacific
again, and three other
matches are yet to be con
firmed. Stanford will head
into the 16-team tourney
confident and ready to add
more positives to a season
that already appears to be
rapidly heading in the right
direction.

The weekend doubleheader
then continued with the Cardinal
traveling to UC-Davis, which the

this year's team is not one to be
trifled with.

Senior two-meter Annika Dries (right) was named the MPSF/KAP7 Player of the Week after scoring 12
goals over the team's last three matches. She currently leads Stanford with 19 goals on the season.
Cardinal previously defeat
ed 16-3 in the group stage of
the Stanford Invitational on
Feb. 1. Sunday's perform
ance was equally as compre
hensive.
The Cardinal got out to a
9-0 lead in the first two peri
ods, giving it a stranglehold
on the game that it did not
relinquish. That lead was
created by the goal-scoring
prowess of Stanford's two
meter players: Dries and
junior Ashley Grossman.
Both Grossman and
Dries scored two goals in the
first period, with Grossman
completing her hat trick
midway through the second
period. Freshman defender
Sophia Monaghan and fresh
man driver Jamie Neushul
also got on the score sheet in
this period, with both con
tributing to what became an
unassailable lead.
UC-Davis fought back in
the latter two periods
through a brace from senior

two-meter Alex Rawlinson
and junior center Elsie
Fullerton, but was not able
to make serious inroads
against a defensively sound
Stanford team that current
ly ranks second in the MPSF
with just 5.17 goals allowed
per game.
The 17-5 margin was well
deserved with the Cardinal
being paced by Dries, who
netted 6 goals for the game
in what was her highest
scoring performance of the
season. She currently leads
the team with 19 goals. The
whole team got in on the act
over the course of the day,
however, with 10 separate
Cardinal players scoring
goals.
Dries was announced as
the second Stanford player
this year to become the
MPSF/KAP7 Player of the

Week after her team-high 12
goals over the three games
against UC-Santa Clara,
UC-Davis and Pacific. Her
2.71 goals per game current
ly place her at fifth in the
MPSF.
Stanford's next set of
matches is set for this com
ing weekend, as it travels to
UC-Irvine for the Irvine In
vitational, another popular
preseason tournament. The
Cardinal will play Pacific
again, and three other
matches are yet to be con
firmed. Stanford will head
into the 16-team tourney
confident and ready to add
more positives to a season
that already appears to be
rapidly heading in the right
direction.
