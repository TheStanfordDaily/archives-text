## SEEING GREEN Social (r)evolution 
### Holly Moeller 
Last Wednesday was the 205 th
birthday of Charles Darwin.
February 12 isn't a date I usual
ly take particular note of. But this
year, Darwin's work on evolution
happened to be at the forefront of
my mind, due in part to the debate
between Bill Nye and Ken Ham a
week prior.
Taking on what's become a clas
sic conflict in our country, Nye de
fended the science supporting evo
lution, while Ham expounded on
the merits of creationism.
And my Facebook newsfeed
briefly exploded.
Having spent the last ten years
in university settings, the tone of
the comments was predictable:
frustration, often tinged with de
spair that such debates were still
necessary, much less so hotly con
tested.
Because let me be blunt
they shouldn't be.
As a scientist, I am trained to let
the evidence lead me. When some
one (Darwin) proposes a useful
framework (evolution) that seems to
unify this evidence into a coherent
whole, my job is to evaluate the
framework's validity as objectively
as possible.
The reality and, to me, the en
during beauty â€”of science is that
many frameworks are rejected,
modified, or used for a few years and
then rejected because additional re
search has demonstrated that they
are incorrect. Darwin wasn't work
ing from divine inspiration: The
framework of natural selection that
he proposed had flaws and limita
tions. Evolution continues to be an
extraordinarily active field of scien
tific study, as we continue to revise,
renovate and reinforce its frame
work.
Yet the bare bones of evolution
ary theory have proved consistent
and coherent over 150 years and
across dozens of lines of evidence.
Which is why evolution was the
very first concept I covered in my
Environmental Science course this
year.
Yes, you can understand, and
even use, environmental science
without knowing a thing about evolu
tion. But to do so is to be fundamen
tally handicapped. Ignoring evolu
tionary theory while trying to under
stand the diversity and distribution
of life on Earth is like trying to read
a book with its chapters out of order.
Trying to harness biological systems
for human benefit without acknowl
edging evolution and its conse
quences is like investing entirely in a
single company without once glanc
ing over its recent track record.
Ignoring evolution is risky at best
and downright foolish at worst.
Here are some very real, very
important ways that evolution af
fects the planet and, particularly, hu
man well-being.
Bacteria and viruses evolve. Fast.
The first, miraculous antibiotics like
penicillin have lost their luster as
bacteria altered their genes to toler
ate them. Antibiotic resistant bacte
ria kill 23,000 Americans annually.
We need a new flu vaccine each year
because the viral strains change and
evolve as they move through the hu
man population. Medicine isn't about
winning a war against infectious dis
ease: It's about keeping up in an
arms race against evolution.

Moreover, every species is affect
ed by evolution not just tiny mi
crobes. Insects and plants evolve re
sistance to pesticides and herbicides.
Fish and mammals evolve to adjust
to human hunting. And the wild sys
tems we try to conserve are them
selves changing as their member
species evolve, even without human
intervention. We must understand
the direction and rate of evolution to
predict how species will fare in the
future.
Despite its fundamental impor
tance, one in three Americans has no
problem dismissing evolution out of
hand. Some cite religious beliefs
(though my parents, and many of my
students, self-described "people of
faith" able to reconcile their beliefs
with their scientific training, argue
this point by example). Others seem
to simply embrace scientific illitera
cy-
It's this last group that's most
troubling. We can point our fingers
at our educational system: Perhaps
we aren't reaching children in the
right way at the right age. Perhaps
we're teaching science in an incom
prehensible or dull manner (Heav
ens knows my students will tell you
I'm guilty of this!).
But I'm more inclined to attrib
ute it to a disturbing social shift that
avoids science because it is, as A1
Gore would say, "inconvenient."
Evolution, climate change and
natural resource management aren't
too complicated to understand.
Heck, in a couple months many of us
will be struggling through some
thing far more difficult when we file
our taxes. And each of us wrestles
with complexity in different aspects
of our lives: navigating nuanced in
terpersonal relationships; complet
ing a laundry list of errands in the
most efficient order to get home in
time for dinner; and so on. We are
more than capable.
But these scientific concepts
raise scary questions. Where will the
next antibiotic come from? Can we
really cut our carbon emissions dras
tically enough? Where will our ener
gy come from when cheap oil runs
out?
Like the proverbial ostrich,
though, we'll get nowhere with our
heads buried in the sand. It's time to
look up, take a deep breath, edu
cate ourselves and get to work.
I promise: It's worth it.
