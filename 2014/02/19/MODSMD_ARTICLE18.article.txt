# And then there is Paris

### Anthony Ghosn 
I have always found certain parts
of history deeply depressing.
The depravity that our race has
displayed on a wide scale can be to
tally disheartening. Murder, rape
and torture are all so foreign to most
of us Stanford students, and yet they
are on some level illustrative of our
collective nature. Viktor Frankl's tale
of suffering at Auschwitz is a true
testament to the darkness of the hu
man heart, it is the encapsulation of
our capacity for evil as I said it is
truly depressing.
Throughout our own lifetimes we
have lived through comparable
atrocities and demonstrations of this
seldom-acknowledged part of our
selves. The Rwandan genocide, Sep
tember 11, and Guantanamo Bay all
are different shades of the same
black paint inherent in every human.
It is a terrifying lesson, but one that
history teaches over and over again.
People commit great atrocities
under a multitude of banners. There
has always been evil in the world,
and it is impossible to underestimate
how prevalent it has been. Thinking

about the torture of the Indians in
early New England or the political
dissidents in the Soviet Gulag is a
constant reminder to never ignore
man's potential for evil. And man is
capable of not just evil but chaos:
The systematic decapitations during
the French revolution taught us that
we can go from civilization to anar
chy in a matter of months, and that
people walking on the streets can
turn into murderers even quicker.
Although it is satisfying to draw
distinctions between the past and
the present on the basis of historical
context, such an approach would
mean missing a fundamental human
reality. There is virtually no differ
ence between me and those execu
tors of the darker parts of our histo
ry except that I was not subjected to
the same situational factors that
they were.
Stanley Milgram's experiment
empirically and psychologically
demonstrated how anyone can turn
into a torturer in a matter of hours
with a couple of situational adjust
ments. We are, especially at a young

age, fickle and situational creatures.
Once I began to ignore the superfi
cial distinction between me and the
actors of hate, I realized how terrify
ing history really is.
It is funny that all of these real
izations should have come to me in
Paris. The same Paris that has been
the stage for many of mankind's
darkest moments: the slaughter of
the Hugenots in 1572 at the St.
Bartholomew's Day Massacre, the
guillotine in the 1790s and the capit
ulation to the Nazis in the 1940s are
just a few of its most notable scenes
in history.
Yet these scenes are humorously
ironic because Paris is also one of the
most beautiful cities in the world. Its
unparalleled architecture, artistic
charm and historical importance
make it a lasting symbol of human
history. It is a constant reminder
that the human heart is capable of
explosive beauty, perfection, simplic
ity and elegance.
Paris is a historical anti-thesis. It
exists on the same earth as
genocide, on the same land
as starvation, hatred and de
spair. Its statues and build
ings are made up of the same
atoms as those that consti
tuted the knives of countless
murderers.
Paris is a beautiful city. It
is beautiful because it is a
standing symbol that our
lives need not be fickle and
that our presence need not
be characterized by the
trends of our day that we
can all create beauty that
transcends paradigm and or
dinary lives. It is an interest
ing note that if Hitler had
had his way, Paris would
have been blown up before
the liberation; Hitler's gen
eral in Paris eventually gave
the order to save the city. I
like to think that Hitler was
intimidated by it.
As Stanford students, we
are fortunate enough not to
be complicit in any of the
great trends that have
scarred our history. More
over, we have access to some
of the most brilliant minds
and resources on the planet,
and we are bound by our am
bition and imagination. You
have the extraordinary op
portunity to build Paris.
