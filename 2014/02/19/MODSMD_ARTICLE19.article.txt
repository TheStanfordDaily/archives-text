# In Praise of Presidents' Day
## 
### Vihan Lakshman 
In 1862, the United States Con
gress began the tradition of
reading George Washington's
farewell address aloud on the first
President's birthday. In the midst
of the Civil War, the Senate and the
House found Washington's words
warning against party polities, divi
sive rhetoric and irresponsible gov
ernance to be especially relevant.
My, how far we've come.
Washington's words today fall
on deaf ears as the United States
government has abandoned the
ideals they once celebrated
abandoned compromise in favor of
cutthroat partisanship. Maybe we
shouldn't be so surprised that the
House of Representatives elected
to stop reading the address in 1984;
the Senate, on the other hand, con
tinues the exercise, but more out of
an adherence to tradition than a
hope of gleaning wisdom from "The
Father or Our Nation."
Just as Capitol Hill continues to
ignore Washington's words, Presi
dents' Day, the federal holiday hon

oring Washington and Abraham
Lincoln, has also fallen by the way
side.
Today, Presidents' Day feels
much less about honoring the afore
mentioned American statesmen as
it does a thinly veiled excuse for a
three-day weekend. For starters,
Congress decided in 1970 that
Washington and Lincoln had conve
niently been born on the third Mon
day in February and always will be,
removing the tangible link between
the holiday and the men it sought to
honor. Presidents' Day is now asso
ciated more with great deals at Ma
cy's than any serious celebration of
American ideals.
While we certainly welcome the
day off, I can't help but feel that
something is missing. Shouldn't
Presidents' Day force us to pause
and reflect, in the same way that
MLK Day asks us to consider the
progress of "The Dream" or Memo
rial Day reminds us to pay respects
