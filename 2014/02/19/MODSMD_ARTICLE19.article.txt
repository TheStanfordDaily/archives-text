# In Praise of Presidents' Day
## 
### Vihan Lakshman 
In 1862, the United States Con
gress began the tradition of
reading George Washington's
farewell address aloud on the first
President's birthday. In the midst
of the Civil War, the Senate and the
House found Washington's words
warning against party polities, divi
sive rhetoric and irresponsible gov
ernance to be especially relevant.
My, how far we've come.
Washington's words today fall
on deaf ears as the United States
government has abandoned the
ideals they once celebrated
abandoned compromise in favor of
cutthroat partisanship. Maybe we
shouldn't be so surprised that the
House of Representatives elected
to stop reading the address in 1984;
the Senate, on the other hand, con
tinues the exercise, but more out of
an adherence to tradition than a
hope of gleaning wisdom from "The
Father or Our Nation."
Just as Capitol Hill continues to
ignore Washington's words, Presi
dents' Day, the federal holiday hon

oring Washington and Abraham
Lincoln, has also fallen by the way
side.
Today, Presidents' Day feels
much less about honoring the afore
mentioned American statesmen as
it does a thinly veiled excuse for a
three-day weekend. For starters,
Congress decided in 1970 that
Washington and Lincoln had conve
niently been born on the third Mon
day in February and always will be,
removing the tangible link between
the holiday and the men it sought to
honor. Presidents' Day is now asso
ciated more with great deals at Ma
cy's than any serious celebration of
American ideals.
While we certainly welcome the
day off, I can't help but feel that
something is missing. Shouldn't
Presidents' Day force us to pause
and reflect, in the same way that
MLK Day asks us to consider the
progress of "The Dream" or Memo
rial Day reminds us to pay respects
to those who made unimag
inable sacrifices in the name
of their country?
I believe that it should. I
believe that we should re
member the third Monday in
February as a day of height
ened significance outside of
the large banners at car
dealerships and 20% Off
coupons. It should be a day
to remember not only the
lives and achievements of
Washington and Lincoln but
also of great leaders across
the country, and force us to re
flect on the present nature of
our government.
Presidents' Day should
be a time to celebrate leader
ship and reflect on what it
means to be a good leader.
Today, our leaders have
abandoned the lofty vision
set by their predecessors.
While I do not advocate that
we unconditionally worship
the Founding Fathers and
live in the past, I believe our
leaders should strive to
wards political discourse
centered on best serving the
country, as opposed to scor
ing cheap political points or
setting the foundation for re
election.
The current crop of gov
ernment officials completely
lacks, for the most part, the
selflessness to put the needs
of the nation ahead of their
own. This current political
wasteland, in my view, stems
from the systemic problem
that we longer recognize and
appreciate good leadership.
In our democracy, we are
ultimately responsible for
picking the people 2ho will
lead us. Therefore, it is im
perative that we maintain a
healthy discussion of what it
takes to be a strong leader.
The 2011 fiscal cliff show
down, 2013 government
shutdown and countless oth
er instances have shown us,
time after time, that we are
not selecting men and
women who are capable of or
interested in resolving dif
ferences when the future of
the country is at stake.
We need individuals, all
across the political spec
trum, of strong, irreproach
able character, who are un
afraid of a challenge. Like

Washington, who chose not
to seek a third presidential
term, we need citizens in of
fice willing to relinquish
power as opposed to career
politicians focused on the
next election. Above all, we
need real public servants,
not puppets of a political par
ty.
As cliche as it sounds, I'm
a believer in American ex
ceptionalism, and the United
States has been exceptional,
in large part, because of vi
sionary leaders. I propose
that on Presidents' Day we
remember not only Wash
ington and Lincoln, but all
Presidents, regardless of po
litical affiliation, who main
tained a high character and a
desire to do what was best
for this nation. Ultimately,
we can learn about ourselves
today and reflect on the
quality of our government
officials by turning to the
wisdom from the past.
And at Stanford, where
extremely talented future
leaders are being groomed
for excellence, let Presi
dents' Day be a reminder to

strive for excellence in not
only academic pursuits, but
in character and the courage
to do what is right, even if it
is difficult. Sure, great
thinkers and statesmen will
have their differences, but
we should celebrate those vi
sionaries who are willing to
compromise and engage in
honest discussion instead of
retreating into bubbles of
personal righteousness.
And speaking of bubbles,
let President's Day be a re
minder that there is a world
outside this sun-baked, palm
tree-laden Utopia a world
that will demand more from
those in charge in the future.
In the day-to-day adventure
of midterms, papers and
biking through the Circle of
Death, it's easy to lose sight
of the bigger picture, which
is why I believe there is a
strong apolitical sentiment
on campus. Nevertheless, I
believe that, at Stanford, we
can devote at least one day
a day off from school, in
fact to seriously reflect
on the political world we see
before and what we would

like to see instead.
On the third Monday in
February, next year and
every year, let's strive to see
the nation hanging on every
word as Washington's
farewell address is recited in
the Senate chamber, as a re
minder of where this nation
has been, where it is now
and where it will go in the
future.
I hope you had a very
happy Presidents' Day.
Let's make the next one and
the many more to follow tru
ly memorable in the quest
for a better union.
