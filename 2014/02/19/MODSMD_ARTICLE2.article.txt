# Medieval Manuscript Club debuts in Meyer
## Students employ digital tools to explore texts 
### ANDIE WATERMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Students convened this past Fri
day at Meyer Library to use digital
technologies in the study of me
dieval texts and fragments, in the
inaugural meeting of the Universi
ty's Medieval Manuscripts Club.
Digital Medieval Manuscripts
Fellow Bridget Whearty Ph.D.'l3,
who along with Digital Medieval
Projects Manager Ben Albritton
runs the club, framed the group as a
means of satisfying varied student
interests in medieval literature
from those held by classics majors
to those of "Game of Thrones" fans
and giving students the opportu
nity to discover new passages.
"There are these amazing op
portunities to work with these
books that have never really been
studied or [haven't been] studied as
much as, say, Chaucer," Whearty
said. "So what do we do to get it in
people's hands and get them play
ing with it?"
Whearty emphasized the club's
open nature, noting that participa
tion requires neither previous
knowledge of ancient languages
like Latin or Greek nor experience
with paleography (the study of an
cient writing systems).
Elaine Treharne, co-director of

Stanford's Center for Medieval and
Early Modern Studies, said the
club reflects a general effort "to en
hance the medieval division at
Stanford" and to help students un
derstand the relationship between

primary source material and mod
ern editions.
Treharne also singled out stu
dents' use of Transcription Paleog
raphy and Editorial Notation (T
-PEN) software which offers a

constantly expanding database of
images of texts from institutions
around the world to examine
manuscripts as a "fairly new" twist
in a broadly practiced area of study.
Albritton, who also manages Mi

rador, Stanford's open-source man
uscript viewer, described the club
as part of the larger goal of fitting
the software to the needs of schol
ars who access the manuscripts.
"It's nice to have that sort of
check as we work through the tools
and see what people are doing with
them," he said. "Finding out what
breaks, what doesn't work, what
people need, informs the next
round of technological develop
ment."
Students at the first meeting
used the interface mainly to tran
scribe a phrase by identifying tiny
letters from previously unstudied
"marginalia" scribes' margin
notes â€”in digitalized leaf from a
previously unstudied copy of the
Bible.
Victor Xu 'l7 said he felt a sense
of accomplishment after complet
ing the transcription, noting that in
his Latin class most unusual abbre
viations are glossed over for the
reader rather than offering the
chance for independent resolution.
He also noted the importance of
transcription from the original
manuscripts.
"I think there is some essential
work to be done that puts this Latin in
to a readable Latin that we can all
work on," he said.
Whearty emphasized the impor
tance of exposing students to unsolved
questions in medieval literature.
"I can promise you, we will dis
cover things that no one alive
knows that's real," she said.
