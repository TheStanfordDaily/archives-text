# STUDENT GROUPS
## Freshman Dollies selected Newest additions to team discuss auditions, future 
### EDWARD NGAI ALEX ZIVKOVIC 
Five freshmen have been invit
ed to join the Dollies after success
fully passing through several
rounds of a multi-week audition
process. The Daily sat down with
the newest additions to the Dollies'
lineage to discuss the audition
process and the future ahead.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What

kind of dances do Dollies do and
how did you learn them?
Jordan Huelskamp 'l7: The
past three-ish weeks, the current
Dollies have taught us three differ
ent dances: one traditional dance
choreographed in the '7os a tra
ditional dance that all the Dollies
know; one more contemporary
dance choreographed by the cur
rent Dollies, which is a little more
difficult; and a solo choreographed
by yourself.

TSD: What's it like to audition for
the Dollies?
Erika Nguyen 'l7: Starting in
January, we began having work
shops to begin learning the rou
tines. This past Thursday [Feb.
13], our first audition was held at
Roble in front of past Dollies, cur
rent Dollies and management.
After we performed, we were e
mailed who would be going on to
the next round. That was held at

the Band Shak Saturday morning,
and we were asked to perform
each of the pieces and a solo we
choreographed ourselves. This was
in front of the whole band. The last
round was interviews with past
and current Dollies, all of the dif
ferent band sections and band
management.
Martha Collins 'l7: The audi
tions got increasingly more fun

After several weeks of auditioning, five freshmen have been selected to join the Stanford Dollies. The new
recruits expressed enthusiasm for their new teammates and future performances alongside the Band.
and performing in front of
the band at the end the
energy they gave really
helped the audition process.
Huelskamp: The most
nerve-racking thing was
probably the interview
process. You just never real
ly know what they [a group
of past and current Dollies,
Trees and band manage
ment] are looking for.

TSD: What was it like to get
rolled out as a Dollie?
Aubriana Menendez 'l7:
I didn't actually expect to be
rolled out yet because we had
just done our interviews the
night before, at 8 pm, and [it]

went all the way to midnight.
I was sleeping and there was
this crazy banging at the
d00r... it kind of took a little
bit of time for me to realize
what was happening. I was in
shock, but it was still proba
bly one of the happiest mo
ments I've had at Stanford.

TSD: Why did you want to
be a Dollie?
Collins: Well I've been
dancing for a really long
time and dance has been a
really big part of my life, but
the thing that has always
kept me going back to dance
has been the performance
aspect of it and as a Dollie
that's the biggest part
performing in front of an au
dience. When I was at the
football games and watched
the Dollies, I could put my
self in their position.

Both of my parents went
to Stanford and they talked
about how they thought Dol
lies were so fun. My motiva
tion to audition came from
combining the fact that I
liked to perform and my pre
vious knowledge of the band
and the Dollies.
TSD: What does being a
Dollie mean to you?
Huelskamp: I'm most
looking forward to doing
something that puts a smile
on peoples' faces. I think it's
really important to remem
ber this is such an honor
to celebrate Stanford, have a
really good time and make
people happy.
