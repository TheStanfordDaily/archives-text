# STUDENT GROUPS
## Freshman Dollies selected Newest additions to team discuss auditions, future 
### EDWARD NGAI ALEX ZIVKOVIC 
Five freshmen have been invit
ed to join the Dollies after success
fully passing through several
rounds of a multi-week audition
process. The Daily sat down with
the newest additions to the Dollies'
lineage to discuss the audition
process and the future ahead.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What

kind of dances do Dollies do and
how did you learn them?
Jordan Huelskamp 'l7: The
past three-ish weeks, the current
Dollies have taught us three differ
ent dances: one traditional dance
choreographed in the '7os a tra
ditional dance that all the Dollies
know; one more contemporary
dance choreographed by the cur
rent Dollies, which is a little more
difficult; and a solo choreographed
by yourself.

TSD: What's it like to audition for
the Dollies?
Erika Nguyen 'l7: Starting in
January, we began having work
shops to begin learning the rou
tines. This past Thursday [Feb.
13], our first audition was held at
Roble in front of past Dollies, cur
rent Dollies and management.
After we performed, we were e
mailed who would be going on to
the next round. That was held at

the Band Shak Saturday morning,
and we were asked to perform
each of the pieces and a solo we
choreographed ourselves. This was
in front of the whole band. The last
round was interviews with past
and current Dollies, all of the dif
ferent band sections and band
management.
Martha Collins 'l7: The audi
tions got increasingly more fun
