## Stanford financial aid stipulations questioned 
### â€“ Alex Zivkovic 
Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), rank
ing member on the House Committee on
Oversight and Government Reform,
named Stanford on a list of 111 universi
ties that have allegedly violated federal fi
nancial aid laws in an open letter to Secre
tary of Education Arne Duncan earlier
this month.
The Higher Education Act stipulates
that colleges explicitly state that only the
Free Application for Federal Student Aid
(FAFSA) is a requirement for federal aid.
However, many other schools, including
Stanford, ask for other profiles, such as
the College Board's CSS/Financial Aid
PROFILE (more commonly known as
PROFILE), in order to be considered for
other aid.
In an email to The Daily, University
spokeswoman Lisa Lapin said that Stan
ford was "never in violation of the federal
Higher Education Act" and that Stan
ford's appearance on the list was an error.
According to Lapin, the FAFSA is the on
ly document used in determining federal
aid at Stanford, and Stanford's financial
aid website clearly states the purpose of
each required financial aid form.
Stanford's other financial aid require-
ment, PROFILE, has been
consistently used only for
determining institutional
aid. Congress banned the
use of other profiles in 1992
in order to reduce the hur
dles facing students seeking
financial aid.
Lapin attributed Stan
ford's inclusion on the list to
the committee staff's failure
to directly verify with the
named institutions. The Uni
versity has since been in
communication with the con
gressional staff and has sub
sequently been removed
from the list of schools vio
lating this law.
