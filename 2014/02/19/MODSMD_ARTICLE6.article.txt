## ASSU to modify special fees Senate adjusts student group budgets, lowers total funding 
### PETER MOON DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
The 15th ASSU Undergraduate
Senate returned to the topic of spe
cial fees requests at its meeting
Tuesday evening, continuing a dis
cussion started during last week's
meeting by turning to recommend
ing the placement of individual re
quests on the spring ballot.
Following an unexpectedly large
increase of 20 percent in the total
amount of special fees requested by
student groups this year, Senate
Chair Ben Holston 'l5 and Appro
priations Committee Chair Angela
Zhang 'l6 spent the last week mod
ifying the special fees budgets of
various student groups in an effort
to mitigate any rise in the student
activity fee levied on all students.
"After we asked the student
groups what they could cut in their
budget [after explaining the situa
tion], they told us specific [line
items] that we could modify,"
Zhang said.
Even after the modifications,
however, the total amount of special
fees requested still rose from ap
proximately $1.96 million to rough
ly $2.1 million.
Representatives from three stu
dent groups the Robotics Club,
the Jewish Student Association
(JSA) and EChayim Club that
had been denied a potential spot on
the election ballot due to tardy fil
ing of documentation voiced their
discontent with the outcome during
the meeting.
Eric Smalls 'l6, president of the
Robotics Club, appealed to the Sen
ate to overrule the Election Com
mission's decision, arguing that the
club has increased from 50 to 100
members and needs a comparable
increase in funding.
Senator Ilya Mouzykantskii 'l6
endorsed Smalls' position.
"The Constitution states that
anyone can be on the ballot if
they [fulfill] the technical de
tails of the special fees bill,"
Mouzykantskii said. "The
[Robotics Club] should be al
lowed an opportunity to peti
tion for special fees."
The Senate ultimately
overruled the Elections
Committee and approved a
bill permitting the Robotics
Club to petition to be on the
spring ballot.

The Senate then dis
cussed the standing of JSA
and EChayim, whose finan
cial officers had failed to sub
mit a Declaration of Intent
in time. The Senate, howev
er, overruled that finding
and approved the modified

budget proposals.
Senators addressed the
potential precedent of allow
ing student groups to be late
with deadlines by proposing
to significantly cut the late
groups' special fees budgets.
The Senate also recom
mended that certain student
groups including Cardi
nal Ballet, Counterpoint, the
Flipside, Green Living
Council and the Leland
Quarterly become gener
al fees groups. Those groups
will not be on the ballot for
special fees funding this
year.
In the course of the Sen
ate's conversation about spe
cial fees groups, senators de
bated the legitimacy of cer
tain monetary policies, in
cluding printing costs, offi
cer salaries and subsidiza
tion of show tickets. Many
committee chairs also voiced

concerns over granting large
sums of money for the pur
pose of benefitting only a
small portion of the student
body.
Outside the meeting,
some student organizations
voiced their own concerns to
The Daily about the special
fees process.
"I think the process was
very poorly run and the
groups that contributed to
the increase in Specials Fees
[requests] should be held ac
countable, instead of the
groups that followed policy,"
said lan Chan 'l4, president
of the Society for Interna
tional Affairs at Stanford.
At the meeting's conclu
sion, Holston announced
that he plans to run for re
election.
