# P.A. Unified School District superintendent resigns
## 
### â€“ Alex Zivkovic 
Palo Alto Unified School
District Superintendent
Kevin Skelly announced
Tuesday that he will resign
at the end of the school year.
Skelly, who previously
worked as an associate su
perintendent in San Diego,
has served as Superintend

ent in Palo Alto since 2007.
His current contract runs
until June 2016.
In a letter to the school
district community, Skelly
cited personal reasons as the
basis of the decision. He
wrote that he made the an
nouncement early in the
year to allow the community
to decide on what qualities
and qualifications they will
seek for his successor. De
scribing his next year as
"the Gap Year [he] never
had," Skelly said he hopes to
explore possibilities for the
next phase of his life after he
leaves his current position.
Under Skelly's direction,
the school district has un
dertaken a series of large
construction projects and
implemented more rigorous
high school graduation re
quirements. In a survey tak
en last year, 90 percent of
Palo Alto parents and 93
percent of students ex
pressed satisfaction with the
quality of education provid
ed.
However, a string of civil
suits against the district
have cast a shadow on Skel
ly's tenure. In 2013, Skelly's
handling of a bullying case
prompted criticism from the
community and the school
board for the delayed disclo
sure of the results of a feder
al investigation into the dis
abled student's civil rights.
