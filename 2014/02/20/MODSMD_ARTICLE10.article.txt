## Stanford begins final push into March Madness 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
Six games. That's all that's left in the reg
ular season for the Stanford men's basket
ball team to make its case as a worthy
NCAA tournament participant. At 16-8
overall and 7-5 in Pac-12 play, the Cardinal
would probably sit on the right side of the
bubble if the season ended today. ESPN and
CBS currently project Stanford as a No. 9
seed, while USA Today sees the Card as a
No. 10 seed in March Madness.
Regardless, the Cardinal can hardly af
ford to rest on its laurels. Four of Stanford's
final six games are against teams currently
ahead of it in the Pac-12 standings, a difficult
stretch that simultaneously provides a lot of
opportunity for the Cardinal. A concerted
late-season push could mean the difference
between a healthy seed and missing out on
the tournament altogether for the sixth con
secutive season.
The crucial stretch of games commences
this weekend, as the Cardinal plays host to
USC (10-15, 1-11 Pac-12) today before No.
23 UCLA (21-5, 10-3) comes for a visit on
Saturday. Stanford split its earlier matchups
with the Los Angeles schools this season,
losing 91-74 at UCLA while escaping USC
79-71 in overtime back in late January. Al
though it certainly wasn't one of the Cardi
nal's better road trips of the season, the win
over USC managed to give Stanford just its
second win in its last 18 road tries against its
southern California rivals in Los Angeles.
Simple focus and execution against USC
should be enough for the Cardinal to get
past the Trojans, who are losers of six
straight, a streak that began against Stan
ford. Although USC has come up short re
cently, Stanford can ill afford to take them
lightly. During the losing streak, the Trojans
have certainly been competitive, never los
ing by more than 12 points. USC has also
taken two games to overtime and lost two
others by single digits.

Senior Josh Huestis (above) needs just two more blocks to pass Tim Young '98 as Stanford's alltime
blocks leader. He failed to register a block against either USC or UCLA earlier this season.
