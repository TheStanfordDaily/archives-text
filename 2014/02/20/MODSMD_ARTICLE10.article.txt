## Stanford begins final push into March Madness 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
Six games. That's all that's left in the reg
ular season for the Stanford men's basket
ball team to make its case as a worthy
NCAA tournament participant. At 16-8
overall and 7-5 in Pac-12 play, the Cardinal
would probably sit on the right side of the
bubble if the season ended today. ESPN and
CBS currently project Stanford as a No. 9
seed, while USA Today sees the Card as a
No. 10 seed in March Madness.
Regardless, the Cardinal can hardly af
ford to rest on its laurels. Four of Stanford's
final six games are against teams currently
ahead of it in the Pac-12 standings, a difficult
stretch that simultaneously provides a lot of
opportunity for the Cardinal. A concerted
late-season push could mean the difference
between a healthy seed and missing out on
the tournament altogether for the sixth con
secutive season.
The crucial stretch of games commences
this weekend, as the Cardinal plays host to
USC (10-15, 1-11 Pac-12) today before No.
23 UCLA (21-5, 10-3) comes for a visit on
Saturday. Stanford split its earlier matchups
with the Los Angeles schools this season,
losing 91-74 at UCLA while escaping USC
79-71 in overtime back in late January. Al
though it certainly wasn't one of the Cardi
nal's better road trips of the season, the win
over USC managed to give Stanford just its
second win in its last 18 road tries against its
southern California rivals in Los Angeles.
Simple focus and execution against USC
should be enough for the Cardinal to get
past the Trojans, who are losers of six
straight, a streak that began against Stan
ford. Although USC has come up short re
cently, Stanford can ill afford to take them
lightly. During the losing streak, the Trojans
have certainly been competitive, never los
ing by more than 12 points. USC has also
taken two games to overtime and lost two
others by single digits.

Senior Josh Huestis (above) needs just two more blocks to pass Tim Young '98 as Stanford's alltime
blocks leader. He failed to register a block against either USC or UCLA earlier this season.
A loss at home to the Tro
jans is the kind of loss that
could bump Stanford out of
the tournament field and set
up a disastrous end to the
season. As far as "gimme"
games go in the Pac-12 this
season, this would be it.
Stanford's final five oppo
nents have a combined
record of 101-30 and com
prise five of the top seven
teams in the Pac-12 stand
ings, along with the Cardinal
and Cal.
Assuming that the Cardi
nal can get past USC, a team
it beat on the road despite
shooting just 41 percent and
turning the ball over 14
times, Stanford will face a
much stiffer test on Satur
day.
In the last meeting be
tween the two teams, UCLA
absolutely took it to Stan
ford, holding the Cardinal to
38.6 percent shooting while
forcing 19 turnovers. For
ward Tony Parker scored a
career-high 22 points in the
rout, and the Card was sent
away from Pauley Pavilion
with its fourth straight loss
to the Bruins.
If Stanford is to make
this next meeting between
the two teams more compet
itive, the Cardinal will have

to greatly improve its offen
sive execution. Although a
lot of credit must be given to
the Bruins' defense, it is also
difficult to envision the Car
dinal executing its offense
quite as poorly once again,
particularly at home. Junior
guard Chasson Randle suf
fered through his worst
shooting night of the season
in the two teams' last meet
ing, and the 19 turnovers by
the Cardinal are easily a sea
son-high.
Obviously, Stanford's ob
jective is not just to keep the
game close, but to win. To do
that, the Cardinal will have
to find away to solve a terrif
ic UCLA offense that aver
ages 83 points per game and
shoots better than 49 per
cent from the field, both
good for second in the con
ference.
Keep an eye on Stanford
senior front-court players
Josh Huestis, Stefan Nastic
and Dwight Powell, who will
each have something to
prove after having been bul
lied on the low block by
Parker the last time around.
Huestis should also have
plenty of motivation to per
form. Entering the USC
game, the senior is just two
blocks away from passing
Tim Young '9B as Stanford's
all-time leader in blocks.
Nastic and Powell also
have their bones to pick.
Nastic managed just four
points and one rebound in 13
minutes in the previous
meeting with UCLA, while
Powell turned the ball over a
season-high six times.
Tipoff against USC is at 8
p.m. on Thursday, which will
be aired on Pac-12 Net
works. The game against
UCLA begins at 3 p.m. on
Saturday, and will be nation
ally televised on ESPN2.

Six games. That's all that's left in the reg
ular season for the Stanford men's basket
ball team to make its case as a worthy
NCAA tournament participant. At 16-8
overall and 7-5 in Pac-12 play, the Cardinal
would probably sit on the right side of the
bubble if the season ended today. ESPN and
CBS currently project Stanford as a No. 9
seed, while USA Today sees the Card as a
No. 10 seed in March Madness.
Regardless, the Cardinal can hardly af
ford to rest on its laurels. Four of Stanford's
final six games are against teams currently
ahead of it in the Pac-12 standings, a difficult
stretch that simultaneously provides a lot of
opportunity for the Cardinal. A concerted
late-season push could mean the difference
between a healthy seed and missing out on
the tournament altogether for the sixth con
secutive season.
The crucial stretch of games commences
this weekend, as the Cardinal plays host to
USC (10-15, 1-11 Pac-12) today before No.
23 UCLA (21-5, 10-3) comes for a visit on
Saturday. Stanford split its earlier matchups
with the Los Angeles schools this season,
losing 91-74 at UCLA while escaping USC
79-71 in overtime back in late January. Al
though it certainly wasn't one of the Cardi
nal's better road trips of the season, the win
over USC managed to give Stanford just its
second win in its last 18 road tries against its
southern California rivals in Los Angeles.
Simple focus and execution against USC
should be enough for the Cardinal to get
past the Trojans, who are losers of six
straight, a streak that began against Stan
ford. Although USC has come up short re
cently, Stanford can ill afford to take them
lightly. During the losing streak, the Trojans
have certainly been competitive, never los
ing by more than 12 points. USC has also
taken two games to overtime and lost two
others by single digits.

Senior Josh Huestis (above) needs just two more blocks to pass Tim Young '98 as Stanford's alltime
blocks leader. He failed to register a block against either USC or UCLA earlier this season.
A loss at home to the Tro
jans is the kind of loss that
could bump Stanford out of
the tournament field and set
up a disastrous end to the
season. As far as "gimme"
games go in the Pac-12 this
season, this would be it.
Stanford's final five oppo
nents have a combined
record of 101-30 and com
prise five of the top seven
teams in the Pac-12 stand
ings, along with the Cardinal
and Cal.
Assuming that the Cardi
nal can get past USC, a team
it beat on the road despite
shooting just 41 percent and
turning the ball over 14
times, Stanford will face a
much stiffer test on Satur
day.
In the last meeting be
tween the two teams, UCLA
absolutely took it to Stan
ford, holding the Cardinal to
38.6 percent shooting while
forcing 19 turnovers. For
ward Tony Parker scored a
career-high 22 points in the
rout, and the Card was sent
away from Pauley Pavilion
with its fourth straight loss
to the Bruins.
If Stanford is to make
this next meeting between
the two teams more compet
itive, the Cardinal will have

to greatly improve its offen
sive execution. Although a
lot of credit must be given to
the Bruins' defense, it is also
difficult to envision the Car
dinal executing its offense
quite as poorly once again,
particularly at home. Junior
guard Chasson Randle suf
fered through his worst
shooting night of the season
in the two teams' last meet
ing, and the 19 turnovers by
the Cardinal are easily a sea
son-high.
Obviously, Stanford's ob
jective is not just to keep the
game close, but to win. To do
that, the Cardinal will have
to find away to solve a terrif
ic UCLA offense that aver
ages 83 points per game and
shoots better than 49 per
cent from the field, both
good for second in the con
ference.
Keep an eye on Stanford
senior front-court players
Josh Huestis, Stefan Nastic
and Dwight Powell, who will
each have something to
prove after having been bul
lied on the low block by
Parker the last time around.
Huestis should also have
plenty of motivation to per
form. Entering the USC
game, the senior is just two
blocks away from passing
Tim Young '9B as Stanford's
all-time leader in blocks.
Nastic and Powell also
have their bones to pick.
Nastic managed just four
points and one rebound in 13
minutes in the previous
meeting with UCLA, while
Powell turned the ball over a
season-high six times.
Tipoff against USC is at 8
p.m. on Thursday, which will
be aired on Pac-12 Net
works. The game against
UCLA begins at 3 p.m. on
Saturday, and will be nation
ally televised on ESPN2.
