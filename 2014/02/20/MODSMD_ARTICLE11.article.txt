# Tough slate awaits in SoCal

### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With each victory the Stanford
Softball team has notched over last
two weeks, the recognition for the
Cardinal and its ever-increasing
winning streak to start the 2014
season has continued to grow. Now,
armed with a 12-0 record and a top
-15 ranking in both the ESPN.com
and USA Today polls, No. 13 Stan
ford prepares to face its toughest
competition of the season so far at
the Mary Nutter Collegiate Classic
in Cathedral City, Calif. The Card
will be one of fourteen top-25 teams
participating in the 35-team tour
nament, which organizers have
called the deepest tournament in
collegiate softball outside of NCAA
postseason play.

The Card will play three out of
its five games this weekend in the
southern California desert against
top-25 teams, including a matchup
against No. 2 Tennessee. The Vol
unteers were the 2013 NCAA run
ners-up, losing in the Champi
onship Series to the Oklahoma
Sooners in two games. This season,
Tennessee, like Stanford, has also
jumped out to an undefeated mark
against its early non-conference
slate. The Volunteers (9-0) have
largely dominated against weaker
opponents. However, Tennessee
did pick up a solid 3-2 win at the
University of South Florida last
weekend against a Bulls squad just
outside the top 25 that is receiving
votes in both the ESPN.com and
USA Today polls.
The Cardinal will also face off

against the No. 15 Baylor Bears.
The Bears, who narrowly missed
out on qualifying for the super-re
gional round of the NCAA tourna
ment last season, have opened with
an 8-2 record in 2014. The Bears
have already knocked off one
ranked team this year, having de
feated former conference rival No.
16 Missouri 2-1 at home last week
end.
Baylor also defeated the Uni
versity of Alabama-Birmingham 4-
2 at home, a team that is currently
receiving votes in the USA Today
poll. At the same time, the Bears
have already lost to one Pac-12
school in No. 3 Washington the
Huskies beat the Bears 7-4 in Bay
lor's season opener in Las Vegas.
Finally, Baylor suffered a bad home
loss at the Getterman Classic to

Lipscomb, a team that finished in
fourth place in the Atlantic Sun
Conference last season.
The Card's third and final
ranked opponent this weekend is
No. 23 LSU, which lost in its home
regional to Louisiana-Lafayette as
the No. 9 seed in the 2013 NCAA
Tournament. This season, the
Tigers (8-4) have already lost to
three top-25 teams: No. 25 Texas,
No. 21 Minnesota and No. 19 South
Alabama. LSU also suffered a
tough 6-5 loss to Penn State. LSU
and Stanford have played one com
mon opponent in the Northwestern
Wildcats; the Card defeated the
Wildcats 4-3 during the Kajikawa
Classic, while the Bayou Bengals
topped Northwestern in a 4-0 home

Freshman infielder Kylie Sorensen (above) has started her collegiate hitting career in strong fashion, batting .424 with 14 hits and as many RBIs
during the first 12 games of the season. However, she will need to improve in the field, where she has committed a team-high three errors.
