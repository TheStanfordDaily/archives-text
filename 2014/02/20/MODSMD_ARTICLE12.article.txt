## Blurred Lines in the Culture War 
### Jason Willick 
Not long ago, American con
servatives seemed to be
crushing liberals in the cul
ture war.
As George Packer wrote in his
2001 book, Blood of the Liberals,
American liberals were seen during
the 1988 presidential election as "a
minority creed of rapist-coddlers
and flag burners and pornography
peddlers and other elitists." Liber
als' commitment to broad legal pro
tections for criminal defendants al
lowed conservatives to charge, of
ten successfully, that the left was
soft on crime. Meanwhile, liberals'
embrace of broad First Amend
ment protections, even for sexually
explicit material, gave many voters
the impression that they were
morally permissive and hostile to
wards family values.
In the last generation, needless
to say, the tides have turned. On is
sues from same-sex marriage to le
gal marijuana to women's rights,
the secular left has made huge ad
vances, and it is traditionalists who
are in retreat.
It might therefore be tempting
to add campus sexual assault re
forms to the pantheon of liberal cul
ture war victories of recent years.
Since the 1990'5, feminists and pro
gressive activists have been calling
attention to certain colleges' mis
handling of sexual misconduct cas
es and their failure to provide jus
tice for victims. They have achieved
dramatic victories at colleges
across the country, including the
adoption of speech codes creating
broad definitions for punishable
sexual harassment and the intro
duction of reduced due process pro
tections for students accused of
sexual misconduct.
While sexual assault reformers
are usually described as "liberal,"
and opponents of reform are usual
ly described as "conservative," this
debate does not align with tradi
tional culture war fault lines.
It is true that the sexual assault
reformers and feminist activists
have taken the "liberal" position in
the sense that they seek to expand
justice for women and dismantle
male privilege. But in their ap
proach to due process and free
speech, they are unconcerned with
liberal principles.
Since the Warren Court's "due
process revolution," protecting the
rights of the accused has been cen
tral to the liberal mission. But sex
ual assault activists have success
fully lobbied to lower the burden of
proof required to convict students
at university hearings and have re
duced their access to counsel,
among other reforms designed to
increase the probability of a guilty
verdict.
Many feel that they have not
gone far enough: Earlier this
month, Dartmouth's sexual assault
coordinator said, "Why could we

not expel a student based on an ac
cusation? It seems to me that we
value fair and equitable processes
more than we value the safety of
our students."
At the same time, sexual assault
reformers have lobbied for speech
codes that display what might be
described as a socially conservative
â€”or even Victorian sensibility
when it comes to sex talk. Exam
ples include an Oakland University
regulation providing that "no per
son shall use ... immoral or insult
ing language over any telephone," a
West Virginia University policy
prohibiting students from "staring
at a woman's breasts or a man's
derriere" and international efforts
to ban Robin Thicke's provocative
single, "Blurred Lines."
What about those who are re
sisting reforms to the campus judi
cial process? It is true that many of
them have taken the "conservative"
position, in the sense that they are
often resistant to change and skep
tical of feminism and political cor
rectness. But some of the resist
ance to the reforms especially
within fraternities seem to be
motivated by a blind faith in sexual
freedom, an opposition to any regu
lation that could interfere with stu
dents' personal lives, and a whole
sale rejection of socially conserva
tive ideas about chastity and re
straint.
In the Bush-Dukakis election of
1988, it was liberals who were seen
as "rapist-coddlers" and "pornog
raphy peddlers." Today, these same
charges are being hurled by nomi
nally liberal sexual assault reform
ers against their nominally conser
vative opponents. In the sexual as
sault debate, the left-right divide of
yore has been turned on its head.
Perhaps this is a cause for opti
mism. There is a pressing need to
find the right balance between civil
liberties on the one hand and safety
from sexual violence on the other,
and a debate that cuts across tradi
tional ideological lines is more like
ly to yield reasoned and pragmatic
solutions than a perpetual back
and-forth culture war. Then again,
as evidenced by the Dartmouth ad
ministrator's inane suggestion that
students be expelled "based on an
accusation" alone, pragmatism has
seldom been a feature of the sexual
assault debate.
