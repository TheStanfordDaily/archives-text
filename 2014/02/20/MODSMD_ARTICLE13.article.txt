Although the American Judici
ary is one of the three co
equal branches of govern
ment, it is probably the least well
understood by the public. In 2010,
for instance, one study found that
53% of Americans responded "Don't
know" when asked to name the
Chief Justice of the United States
(John G. Roberts, Jr.), while another
18% answered incorrectly (includ
ing 4% who named Senate Majority
Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.)). In
this column, we seek to help address
this knowledge gap by discussing
some of the important work of the
"least dangerous branch."
While many of the cases we'll be
discussing are not only high profile,
but also highly controversial, we will
intentionally shy away from ex
pressing any normative (and, to the
fullest extent possible, legal) views
in this column. Instead, our goal is
to sketch out the basic contours of
(hopefully) interesting and timely
legal issues, as well as to explain a
bit about how the Supreme Court
goes about its business.
On March 25, the Supreme
Court will hear oral argument in
what are likely to be two of the most
controversial cases this term: Con
estoga Wood Specialties Corp.
v. Sebelius and Sebelius v. Hob
by Lobby Stores, Inc. In each
case, a for-profit corporation has

filed a challenge to the Patient Pro
tection and Affordable Care Act's
(ACA's) contraceptive-coverage
mandate, which requires employers
to provide their employees with a
health insurance plan that includes
coverage for a list of contraceptives.
Both corporations claim that provid
ing such insurance is a violation of
its religious rights.

Though the facts of the two cases
differ slightly, the legal issues pre
sented in each are essentially the
same: (1) whether protections for
the free exercise of religion extend
to for-profit corporations; and (2)
whether the contraception-coverage
mandate violates the Religious
Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA),
a federal law that subjects all meas
ures that "substantially burdens a
person's exercise of religion" to
strict judicial scrutiny a test that
is "strict in theory but fatal in fact."
While the question of whether
for-profit corporations are entitled
to protections for religious exercise
may strike some as Citizens Unit
ed redux, the analyses in these cas
es are actually quite distinct. As the
challengers point out, incorporated
entities have long been entitled to
protections for religious freedom.
Indeed, many churches are organ
ized as nonprofit corporations, and
it is uncontroversial that they are
entitled to protections for their reli

gious exercise.
Similarly, the Supreme Court
has routinely recognized that indi
viduals engaged in commerce (Jew
ish merchants are a classic example)
are also entitled to religious protec
tions. Because neither corporate
status nor profit-seeking alone cre
ate a barrier to free exercise protec
tions, the question in these cases is
whether the combination is some
how fatal. Unsurprisingly, the chal
lengers take the position that it is
not.
The Obama Administration, on
the other hand, argues that for-prof
it corporations are qualitatively dif
ferent than either nonprofits or indi
viduals engaged in commerce. For
profit corporations, the government
argues, must abide by the "first
principle of corporate law": the no
tion that a corporation and its own
ers are distinct entities. Because
corporations, as abstract legal enti
ties, are incapable of possessing a
sincere religious belief, the govern
ment argues, the challengers are
improperly ignoring corporate sepa
rateness by attributing to the corpo
ration the beliefs of its owners.
While the question of corporate
religious exercise may be the most
highly watched question in Con
estoga and Hobby Lobby, it may
