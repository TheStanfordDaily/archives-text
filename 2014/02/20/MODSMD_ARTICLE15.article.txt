# ANDREWS ASSESSMENT
## Have Fun (by Papal order) 
### McKenzie Andrews 
This week, one of my friends
pulled two all-nighters and
didn't sleep for two days. It
shouldn't be a badge of honor that
our students are so overcommitted
that when they don't have enough
time to go to bed it's considered nor
mal, and there's almost a pride that
comes with not sleeping enough.
Now that we've hit and passed
midterm season, and individuals are
scrambling to figure out summer
and future plans, it's recently be
come a little hectic on the Farm. So
in the midst of a more stressful time
of the quarter, I've compiled a list of

fun activities and adventures you
can have on campus.
Pope Francis declared, "Togeth
er with a culture of work, there
must be a culture of leisure as grat
ification. To put it another way: peo
ple who work must take the time to
relax, to be with their families, to
enjoy themselves, read, listen to
music, play a sport." I found this af
ter dutifully searching for "quotes
on the importance of leisure time"
on Google, but even if you aren't
Catholic or simply surf Google, the
Pope has a point.
Since coming to Stanford, I've
learned some hidden gems of the
campus. There are a number of
ways to have fun on campus that it's
easy to forget in the hustle and bus
tle of the quarter system.
1) Hike the Dish. It's horrific,
but I've met juniors at Stanford
that have never made it over to this
iconic part of campus. Just this
weekend, the Running Club spon
sored a 5K on that side of campus,
but even for those of us that move
more slowly, the Dish hike is a clas
sic Stanford walk. Some of the best
conversations I've had at Stanford
have begun with me inviting some
one I've found interesting to hike
the Dish. It requires you and your
friends to carry conversation for
about an hour and a half, and it's a
great way to get to know someone a
little bit better. When you get to the
top, the view of the Bay is gorgeous.
2) Let tourists into Hoover
Tower. If you're the proud carrier
of a Stanford student identification
card, you can use your card to go to
the top of Hoover Tower for free.
What you can also do, which is also
super fun, is use your student ID to
let in five guests to Hoover Tower
as well. While the normal charge is
two dollars for adults, it's entertain
ing to use your Stanford student
powers to let in five people in line
free of charge. Adopt an Asian
tourist today. [Editor: As a former
Asian(-American) tourist, I firmly
support this sentiment.]
3) Stanford Yoga arid Aero
bics. Over in Hacienda Rains Com
mons, there's a secret grad yoga
studio. I discovered it this year, and
every day, they offer different class
es that are pretty great. Get there
early, because they fill up quickly,
but if you're looking for a group fit
ness class, those are pretty decent
as well. It's a six dollars drop-in fee
and seventy bucks for the quarter.
4) Play some golf. On the oth

er side of campus, we have the driv
ing range. Regardless of your golf
ing prowess, it's pretty fun to drop a
few dollars for a bucket of balls and
try to whack them farther than
your friends.
5) The new Arrillaga gym:
the new climbing wall offers free
belay classes at 5 and 7 EM. most
days, and the new wall has complex
new routes and super friendly staff.
It's a good time, and afterwards,
you can take a swim in the rec pool.
If you're trying to find ways to ex
plore the outdoors, the Outdoor Ed
ucation center has information
about the latest redwood trips, and
gear for you to organize your own
wilderness exploration.
6) Go off campus. Though it's
easy to forget, we're only a train
ride away from San Francisco and a
drive away from Santa Cruz. Some
of my fondest freshmen memories
include driving Santa Cruz and en
joying Dippin' Dots and Italian food
with friends, cruising along the
winding highway overlooking the
ocean.
I encourage every Stanford res
ident to figure out ways to use their
dorm funds to finance various
shenanigans. Stanford is, put sim
ply, a gravy train of money, and if
you figure out the right doors to
knock on, there's usually one that
opens to free and fun activities.
There's always a slew of a cappella,
theater, sport, speaker and dance
events on campus, so keep your
eyes peeled and read your email
bombardment for events that in
trigue you. Make time to find things
you do that you enjoy and explore
some of the adventures to be had at
our school.
