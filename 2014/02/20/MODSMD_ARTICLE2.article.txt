## Stanford bans sale of cigarettes University slow to address tobacco regulations on campus 
### VANESSA OCHAVILLO DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
While numerous college and uni
versity campuses across the nation
have become smoke-free, Stanford
has only recently asked campus ven
dors to stop selling tobacco products
on campus, a change that will be ef
fective beginning March 1.
However, some advocates believe
that the University did not take the
lead in the efforts towards a smoke
free campus.
The University lagging behind
Last year, Kelly Young-Wolff, a
postdoctoral research fellow of heart
disease prevention at the Stanford
Center for Research in Disease Pre
vention, along with Keith
Humphreys, Stanford professor of
psychiatry, started a grassroots ini
tiative to raise awareness about
smoking and tobacco-use on campus.
They had hoped to get a stricter poli
cy since 2009, a possibility that hadn't
received attention until recently.
"When it really comes to making a
change in policy, it's been pretty chal

lenging," Young-Wolff said.
"We're still trying to figure out
how to navigate the system to know
who to approach next, who ultimately
gets to make the decision and what
information we should have ready to
make a clear argument that this poli
cy has important health implications
and is not just symbolic," she added.
But the team showed no signs of

letting up. Though not officially spon
sored, the initiative has been seeking
support from other Stanford stu
dents, faculty and staff since April
last year.
In the few presentations Young-
Wolff gave, she said some people
were still surprised by how different


VICTOR XU/The Stanford Daily
Stanford's smoking policy
was relative to that of other
campuses.
As of Jan. 2, 2014, 1,182
colleges and universities
were 100 percent smoke
free, according to a report by
the American Nonsmokers'
Rights Foundation. Of these,
811 are completely tobacco
free.
More shocking to advo
cates and their supporters,
however, was the continued
sale of tobacco on campus.
In California, Stanford
remains one of the last of
higher-level schools in the
state that continues to sell
tobacco products. Currently,
cigarettes can be purchased
either at the Valero gas sta
tion along Serra Street or at
Tresidder Express in the
main Stanford campus.
This is uncommon in
2014, according to Robert
Jackler, professor at the
Stanford School of Medicine
and researcher on the haz
ards of tobacco.
"No one disputes that
students have the right to
make a personal choice to
smoke," Jackler said. "Re
specting this right of choice,
the University should not
adopt policies which facili
tate a habit which is the lead
ing cause of preventable
death in America and short
ens the life of its users by
some 10 years."
Philip Pizzo, who led the
School of Medicine in going
smoke-free in 2007 when he
was dean, said he would
"very much like to see Stan
ford University be a com
pletely smoke-free campus."
"I recognize that it's a de
cision that needs other
champions, be they students
or faculty or leaders, and ul
timately the leadership of
the University as well," Piz
zo said.
Pizzo also noted one dif
ference between the medical
center and the University.
"Health is clearly the
purpose and mission of the
medical school and the med
ical center," Pizzo said.
"There was an acknowledge
ment by the University lead
ership that by becoming
smoke free, we were doing

things consistent with our
mission. The rest of the Uni
versity is around the Univer
sity and research but not
health other than through
the BeWell program."
Attempted student initia
tives
Not including the recent
effort led by Young-Wolff
and Humphreys, two differ
ent student-led efforts have
pushed for a smoke-free
campus in the past and
failed.
Jamie Tam 'lO spear
headed one of the smoke
free Stanford campaigns
when she was president of
Stanford Colleges Against
Cancer (SCAC) between
2006 and 2010.
"It's surprising that
Stanford has not been so
progressive on matters of
health," Tam said.
In 2009, Tarn and other
members of SCAC released
a petition asking for a
stricter smoke-free policy
that would ban the sale of to
bacco on campus, push for
smoking cessation programs
for students and prohibit
smoking on campus, except
in a few sufficiently remote
places.
It was the last of these
three components that drew
major opposition.
"There was incredible
misunderstanding of what
we were asking people to
support," said Tam. "Many
people assumed that the pe
tition called for a complete
ban on smoking, but unlike
most smoke-free campus
policies, the petition's pro
posal allowed for limited ex
emptions."
Tam recognized Stanford
as a complex case because of
the campus's large contigu
ous area, which raised ques
tions about the extent of the
policy.
"If you're a member of
the faculty or staff, you
could still walk somewhere
and smoke but it would be
far enough away from the
main parts of campus," Tam
said.
Because most attention
was paid to the smoke-free
component leaving the
others calling for cessation
programs and a ban on to
bacco sales virtually ignored
the entire proposal fell
through. It may be that this
petition with exceptions was

confused with an earlier pe
tition released by the same
group that called for a com
plete ban on smoking.
"In a University which
highly values academic free
dom, prohibitionistic rheto
ric seems out of place and
students feared a paternalis
tic slippery slope," Jackler
said.
The group was forced to
withdraw petition and decid
ed against bringing their
proposal to the Faculty Sen
ate. Because many of the
group's leaders graduated,
their advocacy work was left
untouched until now.
There are signs that the
new initiative may have
more traction this time. Un
like in 2010, students can
find cessation programs at
the Health Promotion Pro
gram.
Cigarettes still on campus
At Tresidder Express,
one of the two tobacco-sell
ers on campus, cigarettes
are kept behind the counter.
"When you walk in, you
can't even see them," Young-
Wolff said. "I think that's al
ready a sign that it would be
best to just stop selling
them."
Ultimately, President
John Hennessy would sign
off on a policy that would
make Stanford smoke- and
tobacco-free, but only after
deeming the change relevant
and appropriate.
So far, there have not
been concerns raised to the
President's attention re
garding the existing smok
ing and tobacco-use policy in
the administrative guide,
said Jeffrey Wachtel '79, sen
ior assistant to the Presi
dent.
"As far as changing the
policy anything that af
fected the entire campus
there are many different
constituencies that we'd
want to consult before mov
ing forward just to make
sure we've surfaced all the
issues," Wachtel said.
Advocates for a smoke
free and tobacco-free cam
pus are confident that there
is enough interest to see the
policy passed.
"The real question is how
long of a process this is going
to take," Young-Wolff said.

how to navigate the system to know
who to approach next, who ultimately
gets to make the decision and what
information we should have ready to

and is not just symbolic," she added.
But the team showed no signs of

letting up. Though not officially spon
sored, the initiative has been seeking
support from other Stanford stu
dents, faculty and staff since April
last year.
In the few presentations Young-
Wolff gave, she said some people
were still surprised by how different


VICTOR XU/The Stanford Daily
Stanford's smoking policy
was relative to that of other
campuses.
As of Jan. 2, 2014, 1,182
colleges and universities
were 100 percent smoke
free, according to a report by
the American Nonsmokers'
Rights Foundation. Of these,
811 are completely tobacco
free.
More shocking to advo
cates and their supporters,
however, was the continued
sale of tobacco on campus.
In California, Stanford
remains one of the last of
higher-level schools in the
state that continues to sell
tobacco products. Currently,
cigarettes can be purchased
either at the Valero gas sta
tion along Serra Street or at
Tresidder Express in the
main Stanford campus.
This is uncommon in
2014, according to Robert
Jackler, professor at the
Stanford School of Medicine
and researcher on the haz
ards of tobacco.
"No one disputes that
students have the right to
make a personal choice to
smoke," Jackler said. "Re
specting this right of choice,
the University should not
adopt policies which facili
tate a habit which is the lead
ing cause of preventable
death in America and short
ens the life of its users by
some 10 years."
Philip Pizzo, who led the
School of Medicine in going
smoke-free in 2007 when he
was dean, said he would
"very much like to see Stan
ford University be a com
pletely smoke-free campus."
"I recognize that it's a de
cision that needs other
champions, be they students
or faculty or leaders, and ul
timately the leadership of
the University as well," Piz
zo said.
Pizzo also noted one dif
ference between the medical
center and the University.
"Health is clearly the
purpose and mission of the
medical school and the med
ical center," Pizzo said.
"There was an acknowledge
ment by the University lead
ership that by becoming
smoke free, we were doing

things consistent with our
mission. The rest of the Uni
versity is around the Univer
sity and research but not
health other than through
the BeWell program."
Attempted student initia
tives
Not including the recent
effort led by Young-Wolff
and Humphreys, two differ
ent student-led efforts have
pushed for a smoke-free
campus in the past and
failed.
Jamie Tam 'lO spear
headed one of the smoke
free Stanford campaigns
when she was president of
Stanford Colleges Against
Cancer (SCAC) between
2006 and 2010.
"It's surprising that
Stanford has not been so
progressive on matters of
health," Tam said.
In 2009, Tarn and other
members of SCAC released
a petition asking for a
stricter smoke-free policy
that would ban the sale of to
bacco on campus, push for
smoking cessation programs
for students and prohibit
smoking on campus, except
in a few sufficiently remote
places.
It was the last of these
three components that drew
major opposition.
"There was incredible
misunderstanding of what
we were asking people to
support," said Tam. "Many
people assumed that the pe
tition called for a complete
ban on smoking, but unlike
most smoke-free campus
policies, the petition's pro
posal allowed for limited ex
emptions."
Tam recognized Stanford
as a complex case because of
the campus's large contigu
ous area, which raised ques
tions about the extent of the
policy.
"If you're a member of
the faculty or staff, you
could still walk somewhere
and smoke but it would be
far enough away from the
main parts of campus," Tam
said.
Because most attention
was paid to the smoke-free
component leaving the
others calling for cessation
programs and a ban on to
bacco sales virtually ignored
the entire proposal fell
through. It may be that this
petition with exceptions was

confused with an earlier pe
tition released by the same
group that called for a com
plete ban on smoking.
"In a University which
highly values academic free
dom, prohibitionistic rheto
ric seems out of place and
students feared a paternalis
tic slippery slope," Jackler
said.
The group was forced to
withdraw petition and decid
ed against bringing their
proposal to the Faculty Sen
ate. Because many of the
group's leaders graduated,
their advocacy work was left
untouched until now.
There are signs that the
new initiative may have
more traction this time. Un
like in 2010, students can
find cessation programs at
the Health Promotion Pro
gram.
Cigarettes still on campus
At Tresidder Express,
one of the two tobacco-sell
ers on campus, cigarettes
are kept behind the counter.
"When you walk in, you
can't even see them," Young-
Wolff said. "I think that's al
ready a sign that it would be
best to just stop selling
them."
Ultimately, President
John Hennessy would sign
off on a policy that would
make Stanford smoke- and
tobacco-free, but only after
deeming the change relevant
and appropriate.
So far, there have not
been concerns raised to the
President's attention re
garding the existing smok
ing and tobacco-use policy in
the administrative guide,
said Jeffrey Wachtel '79, sen
ior assistant to the Presi
dent.
"As far as changing the
policy anything that af
fected the entire campus
there are many different
constituencies that we'd
want to consult before mov
ing forward just to make
sure we've surfaced all the
issues," Wachtel said.
Advocates for a smoke
free and tobacco-free cam
pus are confident that there
is enough interest to see the
policy passed.
"The real question is how
long of a process this is going
to take," Young-Wolff said.

While numerous college and uni
versity campuses across the nation
have become smoke-free, Stanford
has only recently asked campus ven
dors to stop selling tobacco products
on campus, a change that will be ef
fective beginning March 1.
However, some advocates believe
that the University did not take the
lead in the efforts towards a smoke
free campus.
The University lagging behind
Last year, Kelly Young-Wolff, a
postdoctoral research fellow of heart
disease prevention at the Stanford
Center for Research in Disease Pre
vention, along with Keith
Humphreys, Stanford professor of
psychiatry, started a grassroots ini
tiative to raise awareness about
smoking and tobacco-use on campus.
They had hoped to get a stricter poli
cy since 2009, a possibility that hadn't
received attention until recently.
