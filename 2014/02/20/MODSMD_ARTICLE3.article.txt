## Off the Grid comes to Menlo Park 
### SAMANTHA LYNN STAFF WRITER 
Wednesday evening marked the
first time Off the Grid food trucks
came to downtown Menlo Park.
A San Francisco-based company
that organizes weekly gatherings of
food trucks, Off the Grid now has a
yearlong permit that allows the

weekly food truck event to bring up
to a dozen food trucks near the inter
section of Merrill Street and
Ravenswood Avenue. The permit was
approved by the Menlo Park planning
commission at a meeting on January
13, despite some pushback from local
restaurants and community mem
bers.
"There are concerns that [when]

the economy is finally picking up,
having these trucks coming in to the
city might steer people away from
traditional sit-down restaurants,"
said Ben Eiref, vice chair of the Men
lo Park Planning Commission.
Eiref noted that the planning com
mission gives the public a forum to
voice their opinions and that
the January meeting gave
people a chance to express
their thoughts so that the
commission could make an
informed decision about
bringing Off the Grid to
Menlo Park.
The meeting lasted past
midnight after almost 20 peo
ple spoke.
"It was a lengthy discus
sion that certainly had condi
tions, but we're happy with
having the opportunity to
move forward," said Ben
Himlan, Off the Grid's direc
tor of business development.
Some conditions of the
temporary-use permit in
cluded requiring each ven
dor to have a business li
cense and a restroom agree
ment.
"There was a whole dis
cussion about whether to
have one Port-A-Potty or
two," Eiref said.
A few members of the
community also raised con
cerns about noise, as the
weekly market would have
some live music, according to
Eiref. On the whole, though,
Eiref has received over
whelmingly positive feed
back â€” during the meeting
and via email regarding
Off the Grid coming to Men
lo Park.
Eiref noted that the num
ber of young families in
Menlo Park has dramatically
increased in the past few
years, and block parties and
concerts in the park have
been "mobbed with kids."

Many of the restaurants
whose owners have ex
pressed concern about the
food trucks do not appeal to
the same crowd that the food
trucks will, Eiref said.

"There are some of the
restaurants that cater more
to the quick family meal, and

they may be affected by this,
but at the end of the day, the
community has to be open to
new ideas and has to evolve,"
he continued.

The meeting last month
ended with the planning
commission in favor of the
market. Off the Grid will

have a temporary-use per
mit for a year with the stipu
lation that the company will
be reviewed in six months.

Himlan expressed his en
thusiasm about finally
bringing Off the Grid to
Menlo Park after nine
months of discussion trying

to set up the weekly market.

"I think we're most excit
ed about having the oppor
tunity to come to Menlo
Park and do what we do and
create a really cool and
unique experience for the
residents of Menlo Park and
the surrounding area," Him-

Lan said.
Eiref, echoing Himlan's
thoughts, said, "I think this
will add another element of
energy to the community that
we just don't have right now."
