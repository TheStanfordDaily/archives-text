# Late professor accused of sexual misconduct
## Daniel Garza '91 MD '00 allegedly abused three former students 
### KYLIE JUE DESK EDITOR 
According to an investiga
tive report released by KRON 4
News, the late Daniel Garza '9l
MD 'OO, previous assistant pro
fessor of orthopedic surgery at
the Stanford School of Medicine
and medical director for the
San Francisco 49ers, sexually
abused at least three Stanford
students during his time at the
University.
Garza allegedly lured stu
dents into his home by telling
them that he was dying of can
cer and convincing them to
spend the night to help comfort
him. He would then deceptively
administer a drug to knock out
his victims before sexually
abusing them. No signs of can
cer were ever found on Garza.
KRON 4's Maureen Kelly
uncovered evidence that at
least three young men while
working for Stanford were
drugged and molested by
Garza. When the University
was first notified of Garza's pos
sible misconduct in September
2013, he was immediately
placed on administrative leave,
and Stanford informed law en
forcement of the complaints.
On the evening of Oct. 15,
two weeks after his home was
raided by police as part of the
investigation, Garza committed
suicide at his house in Emerald
Hills.

In addition to the Stanford
victims, three other men also
came forward with allegations
against Garza, according to

Kelly's report. The three were
Garza's former high school stu
dents in El Paso, Tex., 20 years
ago, and his manipulation meth
ods were similar to those he
used on the Stanford students.
Before administering the po
tent anesthetic halothane, he
would first lure in students by
telling them that he needed
help conducting an experiment.
Although two of the victims
reportedly notified authorities
of the abuse, Garza was never
charged and passed several
criminal background checks
during his time at Stanford.
Garza went on to Stanford
Medical School after his career
as a high school teacher and be
came a doctor and associate
professor who worked directly
with University students. He
specialized in sports medicine
and conducted research on
sports-related injuries, in par
ticular the prevention of trau
matic brain injury in athletes.
He also held the position of
medical director for the San
Francisco 49ers.
No complaints about Garza
ever surfaced among the 49ers,
and news of his death shook the
Stanford community in Octo
ber. With KRON 4's most re
cent release, several Stanford
athletes responded with sur
prise.
"Shocking and upsetting
news," tweeted football player
Ben Gardner 'l3. "[Garza] had
everyone fooled, including me."
