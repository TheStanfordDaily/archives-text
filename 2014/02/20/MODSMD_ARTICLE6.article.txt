# A 						STAR IN HER OWN RIGHT
## LAUREN KIM EMERGES AS LEADER ON YOUNG TEAM 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
In the grand landscape of team sports, it
is very rare to see one player take sole
responsibility for his or her squad's
success. One player leading the group
to victory seems to be the antithesis of
what a team is supposed to be: a collection of
different individuals working together to
achieve a common goal. A single cog in a ma
chine will not produce a winning product; all
of the parts in the system must contribute for
success to be had. For every Jordan, there's a
Pippen. Tiger needed Stevie Williams on his
bag. And Joe Montana wouldn't have been
the "Comeback Kid" without some guy
named Jerry Rice. When it comes to the
Stanford women's golf team, coach Anne
Walker needs a player to be sophomore star
Mariah Stackhouse's running mate. The
hopes of a team with lofty postseason aspira
tions simply cannot lie upon the drive, chip or
putt of a single golfer.


NICK SALAZAR/The Stanford Daily
Stanford sophomore Lauren Kim (right) has become one
of her team's most reliable players and has embraced a
larger leadership role during the 2013-14 season.
For the Cardinal this
spring, those hopes certainly
will not. Enter sophomore
Lauren Kim, who has rapidly
emerged from the shadows
cast by classmate Stackhouse
to become one of the best
young collegiate golfers in
the nation. Perhaps her
team's steadiest and most
consistent performer, Kim
has blossomed in her second
season on the Farm, leading
the Card at the Windy City
Collegiate Classic and at the
Peg Barnard Invitational this
past weekend. As is usually
the case, her path to Stanford
was unique unlike Stack
house, who was swinging
clubs as soon as she could
walk, Kim was introduced to
the game later on in her
childhood.

"The story goes that my
third-grade teacher recom
mended that I start taking
lessons and just see how I
like it," said Kim of her initial
foray into golf. "So my par
ents signed me up and put me
in lessons, camps and all that.
I actually didn't like it at
first, at all. I hated the sport.
It was too slow for me. But at
the age of eleven I started
winning tournaments and
was like, 'Oh, I can do this.
This is kind of fun.'"

Kim has undoubtedly ma
tured since those formative
years, from a little girl who
didn't have the patience golf
required to one of the best
players and leaders on this
Stanford team. Walker's reg
ular five-player lineup this
season has featured a junior,
two sophomores and two
freshmen, thrusting younger

golfers like Kim into key
leadership roles.
"It's definitely been really
fun to see myself and even
Mariah as leaders on the
course and off the course,"
Kim said. "It means a lot to
be looked up to, especially by
the freshmen this year and
be at the forefront of turning
the program around. It's re
ally exciting to say that we're
leading this transition to
hopefully becoming national
champions."
In order to hoist a trophy,
however, Kim knows that a
lot a hard work will be in or
der, including fine-tuning her
mid-range putting and con
tinuing to improve the men
tal aspect of her game. Walk
er has seen tremendous
growth in the latter, while
Kim still calls it "a work in
progress." As for the former,
Kim realizes that only when
she can make those putts
from 10 to 15 feet drop more
consistently will she vault in
to the upper echelon of the
NCAA.

"I was always a pretty
strong putter, but I think
generally my putting has im
proved," Kim said. "My
stroke has gotten more con
sistent and reproducible. In
order to lower my stroke av
erage and become one of the
top players in the country, I
need to convert more of
those [mid-range putts] for
birdie."

Indeed, Kim has seen
more and more of her putts
trickle in, especially at Peg
Barnard. Sunday's final
round witnessed Kim who
was raised in nearby Los Al

tos sink four birdies, in
cluding one on the ultra
tough par-4 fifth hole, en
route to a 3-under 68. It was
one of the best competitive
rounds at the Stanford Golf
Course for Kim, who has al
ways admired the history of
the famed course and those
greats who have walked it.
Stackhouse, in light of her
sizzling 61 on the course last
year, is already counted as
one of those greats, and the
conversation about this Stan
ford team usually revolves
around her. Kim, for her part,
has taken the seeming lack of
attention in stride and has
even turned it into a positive.

"There are times when I
feel overlooked, but I think
it's helped me grow as a play
er," Kim said. "I wouldn't
have it any other way. Being
overlooked, in away, is moti
vating because sometimes I
want to be in the spotlight,
too. I look at it in a positive
way, because if I didn't have
that [motivation], it's easy to
become overconfident or
complacent when you're al
ways at the top. So being the
underdog in some respects
gives me something to work
for."

Improved play, attitude
and leadership development
has led to Walker placing
higher expectations on Kim,
perhaps more than she would
on the average sophomore.
But Kim hasn't buckled un
der the increased pressure,
instead viewing the height
ened expectations as a sign
that her coach trusts her and
is confident in her ability to
be one of the nation's best.

"I hope to see Lauren con
tinue to grow as a player by
believing she can compete
with the top 10 players in the
country," Walker said. "I cer
tainly believe it and feel con
fident that with directed
training and practice, she has
a chance to win every event
she plays in."

And with the team's ulti
mate goal of not just advanc
ing to, but placing in the top 5
at the National Champi
onship in Tulsa, Okla., Kim
might have to pick up a covet
ed individual victory along
the way. She will have every
opportunity to do so, with six
potential events separating
Stanford from a possible fifth
consecutive national champi
onship appearance. If Kim
and the Card are to achieve
their goals, however, they
must band together and rec
ognize that not one â€”or
even two players can put
the team on their backs.

"We have a tendency to
have every player doing
their own thing not really
paying attention to the over
all team goal and getting too
wrapped up in what they're
doing which is really easy
to do when you're out there
on the course alone," Kim
commented. "But in order to
do well at Nationals, you
have to think about our big
ger goal and our team as a
whole and how even if we're
struggling, we're still con
tributing to the team because
there's someone who could be
struggling even more."
