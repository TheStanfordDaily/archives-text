# A
						STAR IN HER OWN RIGHT
## LAUREN KIM EMERGES AS LEADER ON YOUNG TEAM 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
In the grand landscape of team sports, it
is very rare to see one player take sole
responsibility for his or her squad's
success. One player leading the group
to victory seems to be the antithesis of
what a team is supposed to be: a collection of
different individuals working together to
achieve a common goal. A single cog in a ma
chine will not produce a winning product; all
of the parts in the system must contribute for
success to be had. For every Jordan, there's a
Pippen. Tiger needed Stevie Williams on his
bag. And Joe Montana wouldn't have been
the "Comeback Kid" without some guy
named Jerry Rice. When it comes to the
Stanford women's golf team, coach Anne
Walker needs a player to be sophomore star
Mariah Stackhouse's running mate. The
hopes of a team with lofty postseason aspira
tions simply cannot lie upon the drive, chip or
putt of a single golfer.

of her team's most reliable players and has embraced a
larger leadership role during the 2013-14 season.
