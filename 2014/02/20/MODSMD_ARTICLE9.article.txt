## Martin shows that NFL isn't ready for Sam 
### Do-Hyoung Park 
When news of the
bullying scandal
between Jonathan
Martin 'l2 and Mi
ami Dolphins
teammate Richie Incognito was first
released to the public, I must admit
that my initial reaction was to face the
issue with a healthy dose of skepti
cism. While I certainly didn't see any
reason why Martin would fake any al
legations of bullying, the initial wave of
Dolphins teammates siding with In
cognito, coupled with the rumors that
Martin's job at left tackle wasn't exact
ly safe, made me wary of the allega
tions, to say the least.
My suspicions seemed to be con
firmed a few weeks ago when the tran
script of the text message conversa
tions between Martin and Incognito
was released to the public. After read
ing the interactions between the two
players and seeing Incognito seem
genuinely worried about Martin's situ
ation towards the end of the tran
script, I walked away with the sense
that Incognito, a normal NFL player,
had been manipulated and targeted by
some sinister plan from Martin.
Boy, was I wrong.
Fbrther news later revealed that
Incognito had been verbally abusing
and putting down Martin with other
teammates behind the scenes, and
that Martin had been telling his par
ents about his severe emotional dis
tress and his inability to cope with the
duress that he had been forced to en
dure. I found myself eating my words
and regretting that I had ever mis
trusted Martin's word.
After the official NFL report ar
gued that Incognito and other mem
bers of the Dolphins had harassed
Martin to the point of nearly breaking,
I realized that the locker-room culture
of the NFL has some incredibly seri
ous issues that need to be patched up
if it presented an environment so hos
tile that a 6-foot-5,312-pound second
round NFL Draft pick had found him
self unable to continue.
Martin must have presented an
easy target for Incognito and company
as the more distant, thoughtful rookie
from the supposedly "soft" Stanford
University in a social hierarchy based
predominantly on toughness both
mental and physical first and fore
most.
Keep in mind that this is a sport in
which players have been offered cash
bounties in the past for injuring oppo
nents. This is a sport in which the plays
to be celebrated are the bone-crushing
hits that leave opposing backs dazed,
confused and slow to rise from the
field. As a matter of fact, one of the na
tionally recognized consensus top
plays of 2013 was South Carolina de
fensive end Jadeveon Clowney's mon
ster hit on Michigan's Vincent Smith,
in which the latter was brutally
clotheslined by all 274 pounds of a fu
ture NFL star in away that sent his
helmet flying 10 yards away.
In the testosterone-dominated,
toughness-oriented environment that
constitutes the modern NFL locker
room, players are expected to adhere
to the expectations of toughness both
in and out of the facility They are
thrust into a lifestyle of fraternity
emotional imperviousness, money,
drugs and objectifying women in
which weakness is not only intolerable,
but also reason to be alienated and be
littled by colleagues. In other words, it
almost forces players to take on a cer
tain persona and really live it or be os
tracized. For some, it certainly comes
more easily than others. For Jon Mai
tin, it was clearly very difficult to ad
just.
You really can't blame Martin in
this scenario. It is clear from his texts
to his parents that he was simply un
able to personify the tough, steely foot
ball player that he was expected to be
by his colleagues. But the way in which
his deviation from the norm was not
accepted, but instead completely
blown up and made a point of con
tention, was absolutely unacceptable.
It disgusts me just to think about it.
More than anything, it really wor
ries me about the future of the NFL
locker room in a society today that is
experiencing a rapid shift in societal
norms and acceptance of the differ
ences amongst people.
I'm worried for Michael Sam, who
will, in all likeliness, become the first
openly gay man to play in the NFL.
I'm worried for the scores of others
like Jon Martin who could be hiding
severe emotional distress and dissatis
faction as per the unforgiving yet
strictly upheld "standard" in the lock
er rooms around the nation.
