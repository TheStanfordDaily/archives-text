## Martin shows that NFL isn't ready for Sam 
### Do-Hyoung Park 
When news of the
bullying scandal
between Jonathan
Martin 'l2 and Mi
ami Dolphins
teammate Richie Incognito was first
released to the public, I must admit
that my initial reaction was to face the
issue with a healthy dose of skepti
cism. While I certainly didn't see any
reason why Martin would fake any al
legations of bullying, the initial wave of
Dolphins teammates siding with In
cognito, coupled with the rumors that
Martin's job at left tackle wasn't exact
ly safe, made me wary of the allega
tions, to say the least.
My suspicions seemed to be con
firmed a few weeks ago when the tran
script of the text message conversa
tions between Martin and Incognito
was released to the public. After read
ing the interactions between the two
players and seeing Incognito seem
genuinely worried about Martin's situ
ation towards the end of the tran
script, I walked away with the sense
that Incognito, a normal NFL player,
had been manipulated and targeted by
some sinister plan from Martin.
Boy, was I wrong.
Fbrther news later revealed that
Incognito had been verbally abusing
and putting down Martin with other
teammates behind the scenes, and
that Martin had been telling his par
ents about his severe emotional dis
tress and his inability to cope with the
duress that he had been forced to en
dure. I found myself eating my words
and regretting that I had ever mis
trusted Martin's word.
After the official NFL report ar
gued that Incognito and other mem
bers of the Dolphins had harassed
Martin to the point of nearly breaking,
I realized that the locker-room culture
of the NFL has some incredibly seri
ous issues that need to be patched up
if it presented an environment so hos
tile that a 6-foot-5,312-pound second
round NFL Draft pick had found him
self unable to continue.
Martin must have presented an
easy target for Incognito and company
as the more distant, thoughtful rookie
from the supposedly "soft" Stanford
University in a social hierarchy based
predominantly on toughness both
mental and physical first and fore
most.
Keep in mind that this is a sport in
which players have been offered cash
bounties in the past for injuring oppo
nents. This is a sport in which the plays
to be celebrated are the bone-crushing
hits that leave opposing backs dazed,
confused and slow to rise from the
field. As a matter of fact, one of the na
tionally recognized consensus top
plays of 2013 was South Carolina de
fensive end Jadeveon Clowney's mon
ster hit on Michigan's Vincent Smith,
in which the latter was brutally
clotheslined by all 274 pounds of a fu
ture NFL star in away that sent his
helmet flying 10 yards away.
In the testosterone-dominated,
toughness-oriented environment that
constitutes the modern NFL locker
room, players are expected to adhere
to the expectations of toughness both
in and out of the facility They are
thrust into a lifestyle of fraternity
emotional imperviousness, money,
drugs and objectifying women in
which weakness is not only intolerable,
but also reason to be alienated and be
littled by colleagues. In other words, it
almost forces players to take on a cer
tain persona and really live it or be os
tracized. For some, it certainly comes
more easily than others. For Jon Mai
tin, it was clearly very difficult to ad
just.
You really can't blame Martin in
this scenario. It is clear from his texts
to his parents that he was simply un
able to personify the tough, steely foot
ball player that he was expected to be
by his colleagues. But the way in which
his deviation from the norm was not
accepted, but instead completely
blown up and made a point of con
tention, was absolutely unacceptable.
It disgusts me just to think about it.
More than anything, it really wor
ries me about the future of the NFL
locker room in a society today that is
experiencing a rapid shift in societal
norms and acceptance of the differ
ences amongst people.
I'm worried for Michael Sam, who
will, in all likeliness, become the first
openly gay man to play in the NFL.
I'm worried for the scores of others
like Jon Martin who could be hiding
severe emotional distress and dissatis
faction as per the unforgiving yet
strictly upheld "standard" in the lock
er rooms around the nation.

While Sam was easily ac
cepted by teammates, coaches
and other student-athletes
alike at the University of Mis
souri, I think that it is an unfor
tunate truth that he will face
some severe issues in locker
rooms throughout his profes
sional career. Although society
as a whole is gravitating to
wards increasing LGBT-ac
ceptance with the maturing of
the new generation of stu
dents, the bubble of the NFEs
culture, I feel, will be much
tougher to pop.
Just look at Saints line
backer Jonathan Vilma's re
sponse to the news, in which he
expressed concern at the no
tion of being naked next to a
gay man. Look at the situation
that has been brewing in the
Vikings' association due to ex
punter Chris Kluwe's open sup
port of the LGBT community.
And look at the Jon Martin
case, which showed that devia
tions from the norm in the lock
er room are grounds for active
aggression and cold treatment.
I fully expect Michael Sam
to be drafted, and I My expect
there to be unequivocal sup
porters for his cause myself
included. But while I'd love to
think that the NFL will be ac
cepting and ignore the "gay"
label, we all know it's not going
to be that easy.
Unfortunately I think the
label of being gay will define
Michael Sam's NFL experi
ence more than anything else.
Even if he goes on to win 15 Su
per Bowls, 10 MVP titles and
put up a Sports Center Top-10-
worthy play every week, he'll
always be known, first and
foremost, as the first openly
gay NFL player. That will be
the first thing his teammates
will think about when they
meet him. Although some will
accept it or ignore it, others of
more conservative back
grounds will undoubtedly see it
as an issue. And while some
will be able to deal with the is
sue without making a fuss out
of it, others will not.

While I don't think that the
NFL has proven itself ready
for Michael Sam, the move
ment towards acceptance
needed to start somewhere.
Jackie Robinson faced innu
merable challenges when he
started a movement. Michael
Sam will need to do the same,
and I have the utmost respect
and admiration for him as he
moves forward, symbolizing a
new beginning for the NFL. It
certainly won't be easy and the
NFL might not be entirely
ready, but I think the time is
right for Sam to make a push.
Good luck, Michael Sam.

Do-Hyoung Park would have
suffered a fate far worse than
a field-storming trampling
had an oncoming Jcideveon
Clmmey mauled him. Give
him some juking tips or plas
tic surgeon referrals at
dparko27@stanford.edu and
Tiveet at him @dohyoung
