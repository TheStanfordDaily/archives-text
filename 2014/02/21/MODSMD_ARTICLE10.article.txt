## On Opinion Articles: Part Two 
### Patrick Cirenza 
Opinion articles are invaluable.
They are the written embodi
ment of freedom of expres
sion. Throughout human history, men
and women have died for the right to
freely voice their thoughts. As a re
sult, anyone, regardless of gender,
race or creed, can be the author of an
opinion article. The author can write
on any subject, openly praising or crit
icizing anything from a government
action to the food quality of university
dining halls.
This right, which is taken very
much for granted here on our sunny
campus, is a foreign and unfortunately
unattainable concept for a substantial
number of people around the world
today.

Some of you may remember I
wrote an article with a diametrically
different opinion on opinion articles
last week. Some of you were quite an
gry about the last article. Some of you
undoubtedly will be displeased with
this one.

At this juncture, I would like to
remind you of how it is my beautiful,
inalienable right to change my opinion
as many times as I like and fill the
pages of The Daily with my hypocriti
cal thoughts as long as the editorial
board will have me.

Nevertheless, I concede that it is
important to explain why I capricious
ly changed my mind from last week.
In doing so, I hope to convince a few
of the generous people who actually
peruse my articles (read: blood rela
tives) of the worthiness of my point.
Though there are many reasons
why writing an opinion article is a

worthwhile endeavor, I shall list what
I believe is the primary reason
pleading restriction by word count
and late submission time (also I am
sure that what I miss, the zealous
commenters of The Daily website will
duly strive to mend). I submit that the
authors of opinion articles have a
unique ability to challenge conven
tional wisdom and extreme view
points. Their writing pokes holes in
the dangerous assumptions of others
and stimulates conversation about is
sues that need to be discussed.

For readers, reading an opinion
article is a good use of time because,
contrary to my assertion last week
that they are just being lazy thinkers,
it forces them to evaluate their opin
ions relative to those of the author.
The readers' reward for trekking
through a newspaper to the opinions
section is the development, reinforce
ment or revision of their previous be
liefs and their growth as a functioning
member of society.
My ultimate recommendation to
all consumers of this fine paper is to
occasionally make a point of reading
the opinions section (please note that
I wrote this of my own free will and
was not compelled in any way to sug
gest this by the managing editor of
opinions). Inform yourself by reading
widely, form your own opinions and
then relentlessly question them

you will live a happier life.
A note on the byline: I did not
write last week's byline because I did
not realize that I had one. Though I
have a tendency to be willfully insubordi
nate, I claim to have a cause. Thus from now
on my byline shall be:

Patrick Cirenza seeks to provoke his readers
to thought by avoiding the provision of insipid,
mundane opinions. If he does, please email
him at pcirenza@stanford.edu or directly re
quest The Daily to fire him.
