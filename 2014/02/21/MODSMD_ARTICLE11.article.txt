## MEN'S BASKETBALL Huestis sets blocks record Card crushes Trojans as Huestis breaks record 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
One of the critical things that Stanford bas
ketball needed to do heading into a tough final
stretch of the regular season was to win a very
winnable game against a very beatable USC
team. Senior forward Josh Huestis made ab
solutely sure that the tournament-hopeful Car
dinal would take care of business when it need
ed to, while also etching his name in the record
books by becoming Stanford's all-time blocking
leader.

On the back of a huge game from Huestis,
in which he notched 11 points and 18 re
bounds to go with three blocks, Stanford (17-8,
8-5 Pac-12) trounced the Trojans (10-16, 1-12
Pac-12) by a score of 80-59. The Card easily
took control of the conference's last-place
squad and built momentum going into a critical
matchup against No. 23 UCLA on Saturday.
"I'm really proud of our guys, the way we
played tonight," Huestis said. "And then just
as far as the blocks and the rebounds go, I'm
just happy because I get to make my mark on
the Stanford record books, and I'm just proud
of how hard I went on the boards tonight. It's
exhausting, but the payoff is great, so it was
worth it."

Huestis entered the game needing just
one more block to tie Tim Young '9B for the
program lead, and he got one of
those out of the way quickly on the
first shot of the game amidst a largely
forgettable start to the evening for
the Cardinal.

Stanford opened the game
shooting just 2-of-12 from the field
before the first media timeout, but
was still tied with the Trojans at five
at that point thanks to solid rebound
ing and four early turnovers by USC.
Those early turnover issues would
prove to be a sign of things to come
for USC, which turned the ball over
a whopping 18 times including
five from its leading scorer, Pe'Shon
Howard â€”versus just seven give
aways by the Cardinal.
"I'm not sure [why we started
slowly], to be honest," said junior

guard Chasson Randle. "I think it
could have just been a matter of just
we haven't been home in a while.
But you can't blame that on anything;
we just have to keep playing basket
ball, and eventually the shots and
things will start going well for us. And
they did."

After both teams settled in and
started making their shots in the
first half, the Cardinal headed into
the break up 32-23 thanks to the
tough, physical play of Randle, de
spite the team's struggles from 3-
point range Stanford shot just 1-
of-13 from behind the arc before
the break. Randle finished the half
with 10 points, while Huestis led
the team at that point with nine
boards.

The teams started the second
half by trading points back and
forth, but the Cardinal proceeded to
seize the game with a 21-5 run over
an eight-minute stretch starting

with 13 minutes left in the game,
giving it an insurmountable 72-47
lead going into the end of the game.
"Basketball is a game of runs,
and they're going to happen,"
Huestis said. "You can't let that con
trol how you perform on the offen
sive and defensive end. So we got
our guys together, regrouped, and
like you saw, then we just started
chipping away and pushing away
and then didn't look back after
that."

Spurring the monster run for
Stanford was Huestis, who stuffed
his 168 th career block in the open
ing minutes of the second half be
fore notching his 169 th and
record-setting career block to
take the all-time lead just before the
run began with the Cardinal up just
51-40.

With the Cardinal resting its
starters for the end of the second
half, freshman center Schuyler Rim
mer, freshman guard Malcolm Allen
and junior guard Wade Morgan made
rare appearances, with Rimmer mak
ing just his second and third field
goals of his collegiate career.
As has been the case in many
games this season, Randle led the
team in points with 18, while sen
ior guard Anthony Brown added 13
points of his own and senior for
ward Dwight Powell contributed 14
points despite briefly leaving the
game during the first half after he
took a tooth to the back of the head
while going to the floor after a
missed layup. He would return af
ter a few minutes with a bandage
wrapped around his head, wearing a
clean No. 32 jersey in place of his
customary No. 33.
Despite Stanford's slow start to
the game in shooting it shot 28.6
percent from the field overall in the
first half its furious second-half
clip gave it an respectable 40.6 shoot
ing percentage for the game. Howev
er, one glaring deficiency on the box
score was the 2-of-l 9 shooting from
behind the arc something that the
team will need to work on moving in
to its key matchup against UCLA to
morrow as it also tries to maintain its
solid defense.

"I think [the UCLA game is] go
ing to boil down to us coming in fo

cused and giving it our all on the de
fensive end," Randle said. "They're a
great team. I heard they played really
well yesterday [against Cal], We
know they're going to be excited for
this game."

Tipoff at Maples Pavilion against
UCLA in a pivotal Pac-12 matchup
will be at 3 p.m. tomorrow.
