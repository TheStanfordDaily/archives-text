# TOUGH TEST IN AUSTIN
## BASEBALL TRAVELS TO FACE LONGHORNS IN TEXAS 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN DESK EDITOR 
February isn't known for being a
month of big-time baseball games, but don't
tell that to the two teams taking the field for
a three-game series at UFCU Disch-Falk
Field this weekend.
It will be a battle between two teams
fighting to get back into the top 25, be
tween two legendary coaches with a com
bined 3,374 wins, between promising
young talent and seasoned veterans and be
tween cardinal red and burnt orange.
Beginning on Friday in Austin, Stanford
(2-2) and Texas (3-2) will resume their annu
al three-game series with both teams having
followed similar openings to the seasons.
The Cardinal dropped the first two
games of its season against Rice before tak

ing the final game of the series on Sunday
and dispatching local rival San Jose State on
Tuesday to climb back to a .500 record.
Across the Bay, the Longhorns lost their first
two games to Cal before taking the second
game of Saturday's doubleheader and win
ning the final game of the series on Sunday
before returning home to trounce local chal
lenger Texas A&M-Corpus Christi on Tues
day to reach a record of 3-2.

But the similar arcs to start the season
are where the similarities come to an end.
Although Stanford owns a six-game winning
streak in the series, the Card will be bring
ing an extremely young team into its first
true road test of the season as the only team
in the country to have started a freshman
pitcher in all of its games in 2014.
Texas, meanwhile, possesses one of the
most experienced pitching staffs in all of

college baseball. The Longhorns return two
of their strongest pitchers from last season
in junior Parker French and senior Nathan
Thornhill. In addition to the returning
starters, UT's pitching staff looks to be even
stronger with the addition of junior college
standout Lukas Shiraldi and the return of
junior righty Justin Peters, who redshirted
last season.

"[Texas] has a lot more pitching than
[Rice] has," Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess remarked after Stanford's season
opening loss to the Owls. "Texas has all of
their starting pitchers back and [future op
ponent] Vanderbilt is really loaded. We've
just got to keep our head above water if we
can for the next three or four weeks."

Although Texas has not named its

Junior center fielder Austin Slater (above) had a 2-RBI double in Stanford's rout of San Jose State this week and leads the team with 6
RBI on the season. The Card will need to muster all the offense it can against the talented Longhorns in the three-game set in Austin.
