# TOUGH TEST IN AUSTIN
## BASEBALL TRAVELS TO FACE LONGHORNS IN TEXAS 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN DESK EDITOR 
February isn't known for being a
month of big-time baseball games, but don't
tell that to the two teams taking the field for
a three-game series at UFCU Disch-Falk
Field this weekend.
It will be a battle between two teams
fighting to get back into the top 25, be
tween two legendary coaches with a com
bined 3,374 wins, between promising
young talent and seasoned veterans and be
tween cardinal red and burnt orange.
Beginning on Friday in Austin, Stanford
(2-2) and Texas (3-2) will resume their annu
al three-game series with both teams having
followed similar openings to the seasons.
The Cardinal dropped the first two
games of its season against Rice before tak

ing the final game of the series on Sunday
and dispatching local rival San Jose State on
Tuesday to climb back to a .500 record.
Across the Bay, the Longhorns lost their first
two games to Cal before taking the second
game of Saturday's doubleheader and win
ning the final game of the series on Sunday
before returning home to trounce local chal
lenger Texas A&M-Corpus Christi on Tues
day to reach a record of 3-2.

But the similar arcs to start the season
are where the similarities come to an end.
Although Stanford owns a six-game winning
streak in the series, the Card will be bring
ing an extremely young team into its first
true road test of the season as the only team
in the country to have started a freshman
pitcher in all of its games in 2014.
Texas, meanwhile, possesses one of the
most experienced pitching staffs in all of

college baseball. The Longhorns return two
of their strongest pitchers from last season
in junior Parker French and senior Nathan
Thornhill. In addition to the returning
starters, UT's pitching staff looks to be even
stronger with the addition of junior college
standout Lukas Shiraldi and the return of
junior righty Justin Peters, who redshirted
last season.

"[Texas] has a lot more pitching than
[Rice] has," Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess remarked after Stanford's season
opening loss to the Owls. "Texas has all of
their starting pitchers back and [future op
ponent] Vanderbilt is really loaded. We've
just got to keep our head above water if we
can for the next three or four weeks."

Although Texas has not named its

Junior center fielder Austin Slater (above) had a 2-RBI double in Stanford's rout of San Jose State this week and leads the team with 6
RBI on the season. The Card will need to muster all the offense it can against the talented Longhorns in the three-game set in Austin.
starters, expect French, who
served as the team's Friday night
pitcher last season and thus far in
2014, to take the mound for the
opening game. Last season, the
righty finished with a 4-5 record
and a 2.68 ERA.

Not only do the Longhorns
possess a lot of firepower on the
mound, but they also feature an ex
plosive lineup that has outscored its
opponents 21-2 in its wins this sea
son. In particular, Texas boasts an
extremely dangerous top of the bat
ting order in junior infielder Brooks
Marlow, senior outfielder Mark
Payton and sophomore infielder
C.J. Flinojosa. Payton is the reigning
Big 12 Player of the Week after
recording a double, triple, home run
and three RBIs in a 9-for-17 series
against Cal. In addition, the senior
leads the Big 12 in both batting aver
age (.524) and triples (2).
Meanwhile, the Cardinal has
had its own share of success be
hind the plate in victories this sea
son, having scored 22 combined
runs in its two victories. Senior
first baseman Danny Diekroeger
has hit safely in each of his previ
ous four games against Longhorns,
and the senior is coming off of two
straight three-hit games.
Senior designated hitter Brett
Michael Doran has also started the
season on a tear, currently holding
a .600 batting average with six
RBIs. Junior center fielder Austin
Slater, who has six RBIs of his own
on the season, and sophomore
right fielder Zach Hoffpauir, who
leads the team with two home
runs, will also look to carry the of
fensive load for Stanford.

In the end, the most crucial el
ement to this series will be Stan

ford's pitching as the Cardinal will
look to rely on freshman starters in
a hostile road environment. Right
ies Cal Quantrill, Brett Hanewich
and Chris Viall showed a lot of
promise in their season debuts,
and Stanford will most likely look
to them to eat up a lot of innings
against the aggressive bats of the
Longhorns.

As mentioned earlier, this
year's showdown between Stan
ford and Texas will be the latest
clash between two titans in the
world of college baseball, Stan
ford's Marquess and Texas' Augie
Garrido. Marquess and Garrido
have a combined seven national ti
tles and have faced off in each sea
son since 1998, including the
2002 College World Series semifi
nals in Omaha, Neb., which was
won by Texas.
The series will open on Friday
in Austin at 4 p.m. with games two
and three slotted for Saturday at
noon and Sunday at 11 a.m., re
spectively.
