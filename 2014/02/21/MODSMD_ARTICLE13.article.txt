11 fifth-inning runs for the Cardinal
in the last two games
The single-inning outbursts have accounted for over half of Stan
ford's total runs (21) in that stretch. The Stanford offense scored just
four runs over its first two games, hitting just. 183 (11 -for-60) with a
.100 (1 -for-10) mark with runners in scoring position. Yet the team
exploded in the next two games for a .394 (28-for-71) average, in
cluding a .448 (13-for-29) mark with runners in scoring position.
opposing hit against freshman Cal
Quantrill pitching out of a windup
The Ontario native looked impressive at times on Opening Day, es
pecially after settling down when he was able to work in his off-speed
pitches and throw them for strikes. Quantrill lasted 4.2 innings, al
lowing five runs — four earned — but striking out six (all swinging).
18.1 percent strikeout rate for
Stanford's offense this season
Despite its recent offensive success, the Cardinal has had a relatively
difficult time putting the ball in play early in the season, especially in
its first two games. If the high strikeout rate holds, the team will likely
see a drop in batting average as a result.
