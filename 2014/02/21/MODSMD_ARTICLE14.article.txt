### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
After going stone-cold from behind
the 3-point line in its first Pac-12 loss of
the season, the No. 5 Stanford women's
basketball team was on fire a week later,
drowning Arizona in threes while pulling
off an impressive 74-48 win a high
note to carry with it to USC and UCLA
this weekend.

On Sunday, Stanford was able to
demonstrate the depth of its roster this
year as all starters played less than 25
minutes, allowing for multiple reserves
to step up and prove themselves. Head
ing into the penultimate weekend of Pac
-12 regular-season play, it will be impor
tant for Stanford to continue building ex
perience for younger players in order to
be successful in Seattle for the Pac-12
Tournament for which Stanford has al
ready received a bye into the quarterfi
nals and the NCAA Tournament.

Junior guard Bonnie Samuelson tied
her career-high for 3-pointers in a game
with five, finishing with 17 points. Senior
forward Chiney Ogwumike played a sea
son-low 22 minutes but still managed to
score 15 points and grab nine rebounds,
while starting point guard Amber Orrange
had nine points and nine assists.

All five freshmen were able to see
ample playing time and make contribu
tions. Starting guard Lili Thompson led
the way with nine points and four assists
and forward Erica McCall also scored sev
en points and grabbed seven rebounds.
Briana Roberson played a season-high 20
minutes at the point guard position, grab
bing a steal and finishing with four
points. Forward Kailee Johnson hit a
triple, grabbed four rebounds and fin
ished with two assists.
With the starters able to afford so
much rest and the reserves able to main
tain the same tempo and high level of

play, the team looks fully prepared to em
bark on its final regular-season road trip.
The Cardinal will take on the Trojans
on Friday at the Galen Center in Los An
geles. After dismantling USC at Maples
last month, Stanford was able to shake off
the second-place team in the Pac-12 and
assert itself as the clear leader.

Including its loss to Stanford, USC
has lost four of the last six games, which
pushed it into the logjam in the middle of
the conference standings. Senior Cassie
Harberts leads the Trojans with 16.6
points and 7.7 rebounds per game, while
junior guard Ariya Cook is averaging 15.7
points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
Against UCLA earlier this season,
the Cardinal was able to put together a

30-point lead before it lost much of that
gap when Ogwumike sat out with 10
minutes remaining, allowing UCLA to
come back to within single digits and
make it a close game with five minutes
remaining. UCLA is led by sixth-year sen
ior forward Atonye Nyingifa, who aver
ages 19.0 points and 9.0 rebounds per
game, and sophomore guard Nirra Fields,
who averages 17.0 points and 6.3 re
bounds per game.
Tipoff at the Galen Center against
USC is set for 6 p.m. Friday with Sun
day's game at Pauley Pavilion against
UCLA starting at 4 p.m.
