# HOCKEY RIVALRY ADDS NEW CHAPTER
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
I will never forget the
time I took former Daily
editor in chief and
misguided Canucks fan
Ed Ngai to a Sharks
game earlier this year. Since
Vancouver and San Jose are
now in the same division,
Ed decided that he would
have no choice but to root
against the Sharks.

So when the Minnesota Wild scored in the first pe
riod, what did my friend from up north do? He jumped
up, screamed and proceeded to hop up and down with
his hands raised high above his head while spinning in a
tiny circle, taking his time to gloat to the mass of Sharks
fans around him. About a goal by a random team. In my
seats.

Them Canadians. What nerve, eh?
Who else would score the overtime goal to send
the U.S. men's hockey team home packing with a sil
ver medal in the 2010 Winter Olympics? Who else
would repeat the heartbreaking feat four years later, as
the Canadian women's team did with a three-goal
comeback (ending in overtime, once again) in Thurs
day's final? Who else —as I've jokingly complained
here before would come into my arena and delay
my hockey with two minutes of their national anthem?
Really, I love everything about Canada. They've
got maple syrup, universal healthcare and a damn good
(if not well-mannered) EIC not to mention the best
sport known to mankind. Patrick Marleau is Canadian.
Joe Thornton is Canadian. Logan Couture is Canadian.
How can you go wrong?

Speaking of Marleau, my favorite professional ath
lete ... if you're reading this between 9 a.m. and noon
on Friday and haven't yet figured out why I'm writing
about the U.S.-Canada rivalry, crumple up this paper
and find the nearest TV There's a game on.
Our friendly rivalry with the friendliest country
on earth is truly unique. There are none of the nasty
political undertones of the U.S.-Russia rivalry, and it
hasn't pervaded our cultures the way it has with Eng
land and France's historical animosity. Save for Ed's oc
casional outburst of heretical Sedinenry, the only time
I ever feel myself wishing poorly for Canada is during
the hockey medal rounds of the Winter Olympics.
I'm actually not that upset that Friday's U.S.-Cana
da game is only a semifinal. The 2010 final in Vancou
ver was a special moment, with the Canadians winning
Olympic gold on home ice for the first time ever and

the NHEs poster boy, Sidney Crosby, sealing
it in overtime. For the rivalry's sake, maybe
that moment needs a little space.

In the minutes after the heartbreak
back in 2010, my dad told me to find com
fort in the fact that American kids probably
wouldn't go to sleep sad that night; if the
game had gone the other way, the reaction
would have been considerably more morose
north of the border.

But what makes Friday's installment
in the rivalry special is that it means just
as much in both countries or as close
as we will ever get in hockey. The Canadi

ans had their emotionally charged win in
2010 but were uncompetitive in 2006;
the Americans missed their shot on home
ice in 2002 and were uncompetitive in
1998. This, on the other hand, is a show
down between the two best hockey teams
in the world at a neutral site a hockey
Super Bowl, more or less. The winner
isn't guaranteed the gold, but the brag
ging rights are real, and I know I'm going
to watch.
Just not with Ed.
