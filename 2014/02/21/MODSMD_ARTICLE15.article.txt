# HOCKEY RIVALRY ADDS NEW CHAPTER
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
I will never forget the
time I took former Daily
editor in chief and
misguided Canucks fan
Ed Ngai to a Sharks
game earlier this year. Since
Vancouver and San Jose are
now in the same division,
Ed decided that he would
have no choice but to root
against the Sharks.

So when the Minnesota Wild scored in the first pe
riod, what did my friend from up north do? He jumped
up, screamed and proceeded to hop up and down with
his hands raised high above his head while spinning in a
tiny circle, taking his time to gloat to the mass of Sharks
fans around him. About a goal by a random team. In my
seats.

Them Canadians. What nerve, eh?
Who else would score the overtime goal to send
the U.S. men's hockey team home packing with a sil
ver medal in the 2010 Winter Olympics? Who else
would repeat the heartbreaking feat four years later, as
the Canadian women's team did with a three-goal
comeback (ending in overtime, once again) in Thurs
day's final? Who else â€”as I've jokingly complained
here before would come into my arena and delay
my hockey with two minutes of their national anthem?
Really, I love everything about Canada. They've
got maple syrup, universal healthcare and a damn good
(if not well-mannered) EIC not to mention the best

Speaking of Marleau, my favorite professional ath

on Friday and haven't yet figured out why I'm writing
about the U.S.-Canada rivalry, crumple up this paper
and find the nearest TV There's a game on.
Our friendly rivalry with the friendliest country
on earth is truly unique. There are none of the nasty
political undertones of the U.S.-Russia rivalry, and it
hasn't pervaded our cultures the way it has with Eng
land and France's historical animosity. Save for Ed's oc
casional outburst of heretical Sedinenry, the only time
I ever feel myself wishing poorly for Canada is during
the hockey medal rounds of the Winter Olympics.
I'm actually not that upset that Friday's U.S.-Cana
da game is only a semifinal. The 2010 final in Vancou
ver was a special moment, with the Canadians winning
Olympic gold on home ice for the first time ever and
