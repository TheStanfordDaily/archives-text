## SHOW REVIEW: Salvant performs refreshing lineup 
### ELIZABETH WOODSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This Valentine's Day, Stan
ford's Bing Concert Hall was
graced by the presence of
singer Cecile McLorin Sal
vant, whose unique talent is
resurrecting the art of jazz
in the 21st century. Announced
from the stage, Salvant presented
a program that refreshingly broke
from the traditional collection of
love songs expected on this day.
Spanning genres, eras and emo
tions, Salvant sang jazz standards
like "I Only Have Eyes for You",
excerpts from musical produc
tions such as the "Step Sister's
Lament" from Cinderella, the
soundtrack from a 1928 silent
film "Laugh Clown Laugh." It
quickly became clear that one
should not attempt to guess what
was coming next.

With Salvant, that unpre
dictability is a hallmark. She began
her study of jazz while spending
time in the South of France at age
18. She had always sung opera,
but jazz? Not until she was
stopped in the street by an elderly
saxophone player who insisted
that she join a jam session he was
hosting that evening. This man
would become her only jazz
teacher. A mere five years later, at
age 23, Salvant was the first-prize
recipient of the Thelonius Monk
International Jazz Competition.

One might think this recognition
would render the recipient a
pompous diva. The opposite is
true with Salvant.

Her humility was palpable
from the moment she entered the
stage, last in line behind the
drummer, pianist, and bassist. She
moved slowly, hands clasped
across a full-throated red dress,
manner unassuming yet elegant.
Immediately, it was clear that Sal
vant was savoring every moment,
and the audience followed her
lead. She spent the majority of the
concert facing away from us. The
music moved her, sometimes out
of the circle of light, inside which
every performer is taught one
must stay in order to retain the at
tention of the audience. But these
antiquated rules of success do not
apply to Salvant. She is comfort
able in that darkness and will
leave the light whenever she feels
so inclined without being lost
from view or forgotten by the au
dience.

Salvant's unpredictability is
the underpinning to her unique
ness. It seems that a range of ages
exists in her body, summoned ef
fortlessly and immediately when
called upon. At times, Salvant em
bodied a young girl, voice high
and airy as if floating above the au
ditorium as in "I Didn't Know
What Time It Was", the timeless
classic Salvant proclaimed as "my fa
vorite, favorite, favorite, favorite". A
millisecond later, the depth of tone and
wisdom found only in an 80-year old

sage would emerge, octaves below
what could be dreamed possible from
her previous tone. And no air existed
between these monumental peaks and
troughs. Transitions were breathless,
pure and smooth.
Avery unique piece in the program
was "You Bring Out the Savage in Me",
made famous in the 19305. With lyrics

that once must have shocked listeners,
this piece viscerally showcased Salvant's
vocal depth, but through her trademark
subtlety. The centerpiece of the song
was a mesmerizing solo by the drum
mer, Pete Van Nostrand, involving every
surface offered by the instrument. It
must be noted that Salvant's other two
band members, bassist Paul Siviki and pi
anist Aaron Diehl, were also phenome
nal. They possessed the true mark of ex
cellence â€”you did not notice them
when Salvant sang, but their solos were
completely mesmerizing.

The pinnacle of the evening was
Salvant's rendition of Billie Holiday's
classic, "What a Little Moonlight Can
Do". It was almost impossible to link
this musical innovation to its original
fast-paced jingle. She began the piece
with a chill-inducing series of oohs in
the high register of her voice that auto
matically fills the listener with memo
ries. She slid into the recognizable
melody for intervals only long enough
to remind the listener of the song's
roots. But no one was complaining, the
audience would have happily followed
her voice on whatever path she em
barked and this song was no exception.
A standing ovation followed Sal
vant off the stage, pleading for more.
Her single encore was dedicated to
every audience member currently
without a Valentine, the announce
ment of which received bemused (and
perhaps appreciative) laughter. When
Salvant began the immediately recog
nizable strands of Somewhere from
Bernstein's and Sondheim's West Side
Story , the audience released an ener
gy that could be felt. Longing, memo
ries, expectant, innocent, appreciative
the emotions evoked by her incred
ible talent are innumerable. This is a
singer I will proudly tell my grandchil
dren that I got the chance to see per
forming live at the start of her career.
