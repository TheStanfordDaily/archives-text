## SHOW REVIEW: Salvant performs refreshing lineup 
### ELIZABETH WOODSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This Valentine's Day, Stan
ford's Bing Concert Hall was
graced by the presence of
singer Cecile McLorin Sal
vant, whose unique talent is
resurrecting the art of jazz
in the 21st century. Announced
from the stage, Salvant presented
a program that refreshingly broke
from the traditional collection of
love songs expected on this day.
Spanning genres, eras and emo
tions, Salvant sang jazz standards
like "I Only Have Eyes for You",
excerpts from musical produc
tions such as the "Step Sister's
Lament" from Cinderella, the
soundtrack from a 1928 silent
film "Laugh Clown Laugh." It
quickly became clear that one
should not attempt to guess what
was coming next.

With Salvant, that unpre
dictability is a hallmark. She began
her study of jazz while spending
time in the South of France at age
18. She had always sung opera,
but jazz? Not until she was
stopped in the street by an elderly
saxophone player who insisted
that she join a jam session he was
hosting that evening. This man
would become her only jazz
teacher. A mere five years later, at
age 23, Salvant was the first-prize
recipient of the Thelonius Monk
International Jazz Competition.

One might think this recognition
would render the recipient a
pompous diva. The opposite is
true with Salvant.

Her humility was palpable
from the moment she entered the
stage, last in line behind the
drummer, pianist, and bassist. She
moved slowly, hands clasped
across a full-throated red dress,
manner unassuming yet elegant.
Immediately, it was clear that Sal
vant was savoring every moment,
and the audience followed her
lead. She spent the majority of the
concert facing away from us. The
music moved her, sometimes out
of the circle of light, inside which
every performer is taught one
must stay in order to retain the at
tention of the audience. But these
antiquated rules of success do not
apply to Salvant. She is comfort
able in that darkness and will
leave the light whenever she feels
so inclined without being lost
from view or forgotten by the au
dience.

Salvant's unpredictability is
the underpinning to her unique
ness. It seems that a range of ages
exists in her body, summoned ef
fortlessly and immediately when
called upon. At times, Salvant em
bodied a young girl, voice high
and airy as if floating above the au
ditorium as in "I Didn't Know
What Time It Was", the timeless
