With an expected sense of decorum, visitors
took their seats in the SFJAZZ Center's Min
er Auditorium, and quietly prepared for an
evening of Latin jazz. As the lights dimmed,
I felt the mood of the room change. Sudden
ly, performer John Santos was on stage, en
gaging us, the audience, in casual repartee. Instead of
providing a formal context for the performance, Santos
informally talked about his love for Latin jazz, and joked
with the audience about buying his new CD.
It was this casual atmosphere that immediately
set the space apart from other theaters I had visited
previously.

"We wanted a space that had the intimacy of a

jazz club, but had all the functions of a major per
forming arts center," affirmed Executive Director of
SFJAZZ Randall Kline.

Even upon entering the SFJAZZ Center, you see a
balance between the grandeur of a theater and a more
relaxed, social atmosphere. Though many glass build
ings have an austere presence, the SFJAZZ Center gives
off an inviting vibe, drawing the average passerby in
side. According to Kline, the use of glass in the facade
was instrumental, as "we wanted to increase the acces
sibility to the music while lowering the intimidation
people might have to the music."

At the same time, the exterior has a theatrical pres
ence. Like many Broadway theaters, the SFJAZZ Center
lights up at night, setting it apart from neighboring
