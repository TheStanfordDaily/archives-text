# SFJAZZ CENTER
## A 						look at Bay Area's Jazz Mecca 
### MARY CAROLE OVERHOLT DESK EDITOR 
With an expected sense of decorum, visitors
took their seats in the SFJAZZ Center's Min
er Auditorium, and quietly prepared for an
evening of Latin jazz. As the lights dimmed,
I felt the mood of the room change. Sudden
ly, performer John Santos was on stage, en
gaging us, the audience, in casual repartee. Instead of
providing a formal context for the performance, Santos
informally talked about his love for Latin jazz, and joked
with the audience about buying his new CD.
It was this casual atmosphere that immediately
set the space apart from other theaters I had visited
previously.

"We wanted a space that had the intimacy of a

jazz club, but had all the functions of a major per
forming arts center," affirmed Executive Director of
SFJAZZ Randall Kline.

Even upon entering the SFJAZZ Center, you see a
balance between the grandeur of a theater and a more
relaxed, social atmosphere. Though many glass build
ings have an austere presence, the SFJAZZ Center gives
off an inviting vibe, drawing the average passerby in
side. According to Kline, the use of glass in the facade
was instrumental, as "we wanted to increase the acces
sibility to the music while lowering the intimidation
people might have to the music."

At the same time, the exterior has a theatrical pres
ence. Like many Broadway theaters, the SFJAZZ Center
lights up at night, setting it apart from neighboring

Concrete floors and simple modern de
sign define the lobby area and staircase up to
the Miner Auditorium. However, inside the
auditorium, the slatted wood paneling cover
ing most of the walls establishes a new sense
of warmth and intimacy. According to the
theater's acoustician Sam Berkow, the design
of this auditorium corresponds with the
"great desire to make the entire audience
feel as unified as possible." With seating on
all four sides of the stage, members of the au
dience can see both the performers and each
other throughout the night. It almost felt like
I was in the smaller, more intimate venue of
a jazz club.
The main auditorium's asymmetrical de
sign is both aesthetically pleasing and techni
cally ingenious. Berkow commented, the
"asymmetry reduces the geometric complexity
of the room, which is useful in trying to achieve
a uniform sound for the audience." Berkow ex
plained that he aimed to create a sense of tonal
balance in each performance room
A large canopy of wooden acoustical is
perched above the stage to scatter sound
across the room. Provisions had to be made
for this room to remain acoustically isolated,
so as to not interrupt performances in neigh
boring auditoriums. According to Berkow, this
issue was resolved through "box in box con
struction," prohibiting any sound transfer
through services like ducts or pipes.
"We were inspired by Boston's Old South
Meeting Hall as well as Unitarian churches de
signed by Frank Lloyd Wright and Louis
Kahn," stated Kline. Even though it was built
in the past year, the SFJAZZ Center echoes
these buildings' preoccupation with space,
acoustics and the fostering of community.
Only a year past its final stage of construc
tion, the SFJAZZ Centre has sent ripples
through the Bay Area community with the
bold aesthetics and acoustics of its design,
just as it sends sonic ripples of jazz through
its auditoriums every week. The center now
serves as the long overdue, centralized home
of jazz music in San Francisco. With a home
base, SFJAZZ has been able to better infil
trate the community by more frequently of
fering shows. With this increase has come a

spike in annual membership. Today, the mod
ern SFJAZZ Center stands as a symbol both of
jazz in San Francisco, and of jazz as a mod
ern, international art.
