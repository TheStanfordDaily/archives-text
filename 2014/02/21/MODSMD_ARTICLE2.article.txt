"I prefer free white citizens to any other class or race.
I prefer the white man to the negro as an inhabitant of our
country."

These polarizing words were spoken by Leland Stan
ford in 1859, as he accepted the Republican Party nomina
tion as governor of California. He would go on to found
Stanford University in 1891.
