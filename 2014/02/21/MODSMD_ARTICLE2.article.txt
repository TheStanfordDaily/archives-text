## Fifty Years Later Stanford reflects on activism and the Civil Rights Act of '64 
### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
"I prefer free white citizens to any other class or race.
I prefer the white man to the negro as an inhabitant of our
country."

These polarizing words were spoken by Leland Stan
ford in 1859, as he accepted the Republican Party nomina
tion as governor of California. He would go on to found
Stanford University in 1891.

Yet this discriminatory mindset held by Stanford and
others of his time no longer commands the same influence

on this campus as the University celebrates
the 40th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964, which ended all major forms of dis
crimination based on race, ethnicity, nation
ality, religion or gender.
Civil rights at Stanford
According to Clayborne Carson, profes
sor of history and director of the Martin
Luther King, Jr., Research and Education In
stitute, Stanford has changed dramatically in
the years following this legislation, with the
"white Anglo-Saxon, Protestant back
ground" becoming the minority on campus.
As a student at UCLA during the Civil
Rights movement in the 19605, Carson had
worked in Los Angeles with the Student

Nonviolent Coordinator Committee
(SNCC).
"We didn't have segregated lunch coun
ters, [but] we dealt with employment dis
crimination, trying to get the black commu
nity in Los Angeles not to buy things from
businesses that refused to hire black people
as clerks," he said.
Carson noted that in the wake of the as
sassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., vari
ous campuses including Stanford, UCLA
and Berkeley began offering courses in
African American history for the first time,
and those schools started looking for black
students for their graduate schools so that
they eventually could teach in that field.
"I knew that many students at Stanford

were involved in the movement and when I
arrived here, there were still people around
who were a big part of that," he said. "At
that point, most of the activism of the mid
-1960s reached its peak during the anti-war
campaign during the early 705."
Carson added that in the early 'Bos, the
South African apartheid struggle stimulated
another burst of activism.
"The 'Bos were for Stanford what the
'6os were for Berkeley," he said. "That was
the period when the campus was the most
politicized ... The number of black students
was increasing, along with significant num
bers of Latino and Asian students, all with
the attitude of, 'Yes, I'm really thankful to
get admitted, but while I'm here, I'm not
going to treat Stanford as if it can't be
transformed into something different,
something better.'"
For history professor James Campbell
'B3 Ph.D.'B9, remembering the Civil
Rights movement is more than just cele
brating the positive outcomes but also un
derstanding its complexities and human
costs, such as the struggles specific to
Mississippi's civil rights movement.
"Mississippi was a different kind,"
Campbell said. "Martin Luther King, Jr.,
spent very little time there, as it was far
more dangerous as a citadel of Jim Crow
laws. The kind of movement that
emerged elsewhere in which you had
movements associated with King's large
scale demonstrations in public spaces,
freedom rides, the sit-ins at the lunch
country, the Montgomery bus boycott

that's not what was happening in Missis
sippi."

According to Campbell, in Mississip
pi, a small number of people began work
ing under the Student Nonviolent Coordi
nating Committee (SNCC), registering
people to vote and trying to create a
group-centered leadership. They actively
opposed the vision of politics enshrined
by King and the Southern Christian Lead
ership Conference, a civil rights organiza
tion spearheaded by King.
"[SNCC] didn't want to make follow
ers, because if you did that, what was left
when you left?" Campbell said. "Instead,
they tried to identify, tap into and nurture
the capacity for leadership and wisdom
that was indigenous to small communities
and people living in a brutal society of
white supremacy."
After facing violent opposition in
cluding arrests and murders and realiz
ing that the murders of its black support
ers made little stir in national conversa
tion, SNCC decided to create a summer
project to recruit students from white,
northern universities, including students

from Stanford, to help with the organizing
work in the summer of 1964.

"They decided the nation was never
going to care unless they brought the na
tion's children to Mississippi," Campbell
said. "Once some of them got killed, then
the nation would pay attention. And that's
exactly what happened. Three students
were lulled and it became front-page
news."

Ongoing discussions
While such issues of civil rights no
longer command as much presence in
current campus discourse as they did in
the past, activism remains of interest for
many Stanford students.
"Activism through social media, na
tionally, has emerged as another means of
activism," said Jan Barker-Alexander, di
rector of the Black Community Services
Center and Resident Fellow in Ujamaa.
However, she acknowledged that stu
dents at Stanford sill struggle with what it
means to be an activist, in terms of defin

ing the broadness or narrowness of the term,
and with talking about race in general.
"Oftentimes, people feel that they are
being accused of something when it really is
people wanting to have a dialogue and a
courageous conversation about issues that
are difficult," she said. "If people were to
step out of their comfort zone ... they would
begin to gain an understanding of current
day issues of how race and racism are still a
part of the fabric of America."
For Kaela Farrise 'l4, co-president of
the Black Student Union (BSU), Stanford
makes a well-intentioned effort to create the
space for different racial and ethnic groups
to come together and share their stories, but
doesn't make it a first priority.

"Sometimes, especially during elections
every year, the burden is put on the students
of these groups to prove their worth," she
said. "It's put on the students to defend our
spaces... Conversations that you might hear
about Ujamaa and the BSU are oftentimes
negative or talk about self-segregation, and
that conversation needs to be framed differ
ently. There should be an institutional expla
nation for why we are here."
According to Farrise, one of the impor
tant parts of the BSU is bringing the conver
sation about race to the forefront of people's
minds.

"It's important for us to have a collabo
ration with other groups, because it's our job
to make sure that our community has a sense
of belonging at Stanford and a sense of own
ing a part of Stanford," she said.
