# SHOW REVIEW
## CHOCOLATE HEADS: AN INSIDE LOOK 
### ELIZABETH WOODSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last Thursday, the Chocolate
Heads Movement Band lift
ed the edge of the curtain to
reveal our creation-in
progress: the second annual
UnShow. The standing audi
ence looked down from the stairs
and balconies of the Cantor Arts
Center lobby as our story unfolded
in black light.
Created in 2009 by Aleta
Hayes 'Bl, a lecturer in the Dance
division of the Theater and Per
formance Studies department,
Chocolate Heads brings together
energies from all molecules of Stan
ford, including graduate medical
school students, computer scien
tists, writers, researchers. All are
artists. Why? "Because everyone in
Chocolate Heads is a rock star," de
clares Hayes. And what she de
clares to be truth becomes it. This
woman embodies creation, dissem
inating it at every step.

It was last year at the UnShow
that my obsession with the group
began. The invisible fingers it pro

jected, breaking down the wall be
tween spectator and spectacle,
were addictive to me. It was con
nected, it was alive, and I had to be
come a part of it.
My first question upon joining
in fall of 2013 was the name ... a
movement band? Isn't this a dance
troupe? Am I supposed to bring an
instrument? The band originates
from the power of our live musi
cians who co-create each piece
with us as the movement evolves
from sparks of ideas to a polished
whole. Movement, as understood
by the Chocolate Heads, involves
physical displacement, velocity, air,
connectivity, stillness and dance.

Our intention is to offer others
the experience of being moved to
tears, to laughter, to contemplation
and to rejuvenation. We seek to
provide experiences of recognition,
of connection. Should the audience
remain static, we have failed.
Finally, as an impact geek, I'm
always thinking about social
change. Movements describe co
ordinated and passionate human
