# MOVIE REVIEW
## "Gloria" highlights generational values 
### GILLIE COLLINS STAFF WRITER 
In the opening scene of "Gloria," by
Chilean writer-director Sebastian Lelio,
the film's eponymous star is alone at a
nightclub. Gloria (Paulina Garcia) makes
eye contact with a few romantic
prospects middle-aged men from San
tiago, Chile but, mostly, she navigates in

dependently, hovering on the dance floor's
peripheries. Everything about Gloria is famil
iar her guts and vulnerability, her passions
and instincts for self-preservation. She is a re
freshing reminder that young people do not
have a monopoly on the aches and ecstasies
of falling in love.
A longtime divorcee, Gloria knows the
lyrics to pop songs and experiments with yo
ga. She falls for Rodolfo (Sergio Hernandez),

a slightly older amusement park owner. Their
first date entails bungee jumping and paint
ball. Soon, she is waxing her legs, and he is
reading her poetry.
Nothing about their sex life is pitiful or
saccharine. In fact, their chemistry is excep
tional so exceptional that Gloria is tempt
ed to ignore signs of her partner's ongoing
attachment to his self-destructive ex-wife and
spoiled daughters. Gloria, too, comes with a
constellation of complicated familial relation
ships. Her children, now in their 30s, are pre
occupied with their own romantic relation
ships. When Gloria's son turns 30, she intro
duces Rodolfo to her family, including her ex
husband. The gathering ends unhappily.
"Gloria" is unique because it stars an older
woman and successful because it refuse to re
duce her to a Hollywood-esque archetype. Glo
ria is a heroine, but she also makes mistakes. To
this end, Paulina Garcla's performance is nu
anced and dynamic. Behind thick glasses, Gar
cia's eyes twinkle with vitality, even as her char
acter braves bouts of loneliness and dejection.
As much as the film is about the particu
lars of a certain romance, it is also concerned
with a broader historical moment and the trans
mission of values across generations. In conver
sations with their peers, Gloria and Rodolfo
consider the legacy of the country's military
dictatorship and the young people's capacity to
mobilize for progress, in light of tools like Face
book and Twitter. In this vein, Lelio explores
the effect of technology on familial relation
ships. Gloria and Rodolfo are often interrupted
by emails and mobile calls, which seem only to
provide the illusion of long-distance connec
tion, while elaborating parent-child codepen
dence.

My favorite moments in this film were
those when Gloria seemed in search of some
thing bigger than a romantic "happily ever af

ter." When she laughed or danced with aban
don, she appeared open to a more basic want
and need the impulse to self-define.
"Gloria" is a movie that prompts audiences
to reexamine our assumptions about aging,
gender, sexuality and family. As Gloria models
with grace and humor, middle age is anything
but static. So long as we are living, we are
learning.
