# STUDENT LIFE
## Activists discuss civil rights Jesse Jackson and Elaine Brown visit Stanford 
### KATHERINE CARR 
CEMEX Auditorium was buzzing on
Wednesday evening as a crowd of over 450
people came to hear civil rights leader, Bap
tist minister and former presidential candi
date Jesse Jackson Sr. and Elaine Brown, the
first female chair of the Black Panther party,
speak at the first of an installment of events
on the Civil Rights Movement.
Jackson, who worked closely with Mar
tin Luther King Jr., reflected on his time dur
ing the Civil Rights Movement and ad
dressed present-day struggles.
He explained the discrimination in his
childhood, from not being allowed at the
front of the bus to being forbidden from us
ing a public restroom. Jackson detailed the
246 years of slavery in the United States, re
minding the audience, "these are real dates."

Jackson later turned his attention to the
status of civil rights today and the work still

to be done. As an advocate for equality and
social justice, he encouraged students to
look into their own lives and what could be
fixed specifically mentioning student
loans and his student loan debt and credit
card forgiveness proposal.
"You will be the leaders, for better or for
worse probably better," Jackson said, call
ing on students to take initiative.
Reflecting on how far the country has

come since the civil rights movement of the
19605, Jackson focused specifically on the
election of Barack Obama as president in
2008.

"I was weeping because of the joy of the
moment. We won the big one," Jackson said.
"I wished Dr. King and all those who made it
possible to get here could see Obama be-

come president."
"Those people aren't here be
cause they paid the ultimate price,"
Jackson said. "[lt's] a fight that is not
over."

Later, Brown discussed her
time with the Black Panthers Party
and how she considered herself a
part of a "freedom movement."
"Before joining the Black Pan
thers, I was blind to what needed to
be done," Brown said, crediting the
Black Panthers for making her
aware of the problems and giving
her an outlet to advocate change.

She asserted that there is a
need for change again today, citing
problems with today's prison sys
tems. Unlike her era, however, she
stressed that now is not the right
time for any mass movements.
Both speakers agreed that the
younger generation needs to be
aware of what's going on in order to
find out what needs to change.
"There's room in the struggle
for you," Jackson said in his closing
statement.

The event was the first install
ment in a series on the Civil Rights
Movement sponsored by various or
ganizations, including the Black
Community Services Center, the
Black Student Union, the Haas Cen
ter for Public Service and the Stan

ford Department of History.
"Tonight is a historical event,"
said Jan Barker-Alexander, director
of the Black Community Services
Center. "I'm short on words, which
people know I never am. For me,
this is personal. These two icons
made me realize, 'I am someone.'"
The crowd was equally as
moved by the event, with one audi
ence member telling Jackson, "I vot
ed for you in '61.1 wore your pin!"
"This panel discussion was in
spiring," said one Stanford student
during the comment period. "One
of the best in my four years at Stan
ford."
