## Ujamaa's place at Stanford Stanford's black theme dorm celebrates 40 years 
### CHELSEY SVEINSSON 
The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.
on April 4, 1968 had a ricocheting effect across
the world and especially at Stanford. Although
tragic, his death created an impetus for Stan
ford's Black Student Union (BSU) to create
change on campus.
At the convocation on campus for King's
death, BSU took the microphone from then-
University Provost Richard Lyman and issued
their 10 demands in response to King's death.
On that list of demands was the establishment
of a black theme dorm.

For Grace Carroll '7l, the event, appropri
ately dubbed "Take the Mic," was an important
change from the undergraduate culture she had
been experiencing at Stanford.
"What led up to 'Take the Mic' was the
feeling of being isolated, that there weren't
many black faculty and staff members," Carroll
said. "It felt like the University sprinkled us
around so that white students can have a black
person in the dorm, but not understanding that
African American students have specific needs
that weren't being addressed."
In 1970, the University established its first
black themed dorm in Cedro, where the per
centage of black residents mirrored the Univer
sity's percentage of black students. The all
freshman dorm had an immediate impact on
the class of 1974, the first class to have the op
tion of living in black theme housing.
With William Dement, professor in the de
partment of psychiatry and behavioral sciences,
as the residential fellow, the majority of the res
idents were assigned to the dorm as a result of
their pre-med academic interests. Joy Simmons
'74 was a proud resident of Cedro and spoke
fondly about her experience living in Stanford's
first black theme dorm.

"No one knew what to expect. It was
all so new," Simmons said. "For me, com
ing from a black high school, it was com
forting and supportive to be with other
Stanford students who were pre-med...

we could hang together, grow together.
Now when I look back, I see how magical
that was."

However, with a growing black stu
dent population, there was an increasing
demand for a larger residential space for
the black theme dorm. The following year,
the dorm moved to Roble, where the per
centage of black residents reached 30 per
cent.

Charles Ogletree '75 lived in Roble for
both his freshman and sophomore years as
a resident and a staff member, respectively.
What he appreciated most about Roble was
that it provided an enriching academic, cul
tural and social environment for all stu
dents.

"There were evening classes taught
on a voluntary basis by people like [Profes
sor John Gibbs] St. Clair Drake," Ogletree
said. "There would be lectures from the
Black Panther Party and students from the
Nation of Islam. They would celebrate
their religion, politics and culture in this
dorm. Everything was open and available
to every Stanford student and that was
very important."
Space continued to be an issue, how
ever, and in 1974, the dorm made its final
move to Olivo-Magnolia in the southwest
corner of Lagunita Court. In 1976, the
name of the dorm was changed to Ujamaa,
which means "economic cooperation" in
Swahili.

With a rich history serving as the dor
m's foundation, Ujamaa built and contin
ues to build upon its legacy at Stanford.
In 1988, Ujamaa provided the conver
sation and the initial stage upon which the
University implemented its "Fundamental
Standard Interpretation: Free Expression
and Discriminatory Harassment" policy,
more commonly known as the Grey Inter
pretation.

The implementation of the policy was
prompted by an incident in Ujamaa, involv
ing the posting of black-face caricatures of
Beethoven on altered Stanford Symphony
flyers. The flyers, some of which had the n

word written across them, sparked an out
cry within the dorm that eventually led to
a University investigation and, ultimately,
to the issuance of the Grey Interpretation.
The interpretation claimed that the use of
racial epithets or their equivalent is a viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard, the

code of conduct for Stanford students.
Even today, Ujamaa's presence on
campus is strongly felt.
With a required 50 percent of the dor
m's residents being black, Ujamaa is the


Courtesy of Stanford News Service
only residence, and arguably the only space on
campus, where black represents the majority.
Within that black majority, however,
there is incredible diversity. Black residents
come from across the world, represent sever
al faiths and beliefs and are spread all along
the spectrum of academic disciplines.
With such diversity among its residents,
discomfort is to be expected.
"People are coming to this space never
having lived in this kind of environment,"
said Jan Barker-Alexander, current Residential
Fellow of Ujamaa.
"It is not just students that are not black
that might not be comfortable," Barker-
Alexander said. "Even the black students are
uncomfortable, because many of them have
not been in this situation to engage in race,
class, gender and sexuality in this space. I
think that discomfort is good because it helps
you grow. It pushes you to learn."
As a white resident who lived in Ujamaa
for three years, Milton Achelpohl' 13 has heard
the criticism that white people feel uncomfort

able in Ujamaa. He thinks that the discomfort
is important.

"For me as a white student, I am learning
about the world through a different narrative,
a different lens, which is just as important be
cause it builds upon and challenges what I
have already understood about the world and
myself," Achelpohl said.
Today, the dorm continues to host edu
cational programs, presented by upperclass
men, every Thursday for its residents and for
the broader Stanford community. With an av
erage attendance of 65 students from both in
side and outside Ujamaa, the programs en
gage the Stanford community in conversation
about topics and issues impacting the African
diaspora.

The Ujamaa community hopes that this di
alogue will help ease discomfort and open up
discussion to the Stanford community.
"Going to these programs and having talks
with [Barker-Alexander], it quickly showed to
me that Ujamaa is not just a place for African
Americans," said Bryant Johnson 'l7, a resi
dent of Ujamaa. "It is a place to spread to indi
viduals the wonders of the African diaspora."

side and outside Ujamaa, the programs en
gage the Stanford community in conversation
about topics and issues impacting the African
diaspora.

The Ujamaa community hopes that this di
alogue will help ease discomfort and open up
discussion to the Stanford community.
"Going to these programs and having talks
with [Barker-Alexander], it quickly showed to
me that Ujamaa is not just a place for African
Americans," said Bryant Johnson 'l7, a resi
dent of Ujamaa. "It is a place to spread to indi

The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.
on April 4, 1968 had a ricocheting effect across
the world and especially at Stanford. Although
tragic, his death created an impetus for Stan
ford's Black Student Union (BSU) to create
change on campus.
At the convocation on campus for King's
death, BSU took the microphone from then-
University Provost Richard Lyman and issued
their 10 demands in response to King's death.
On that list of demands was the establishment
of a black theme dorm.

For Grace Carroll '7l, the event, appropri
ately dubbed "Take the Mic," was an important
change from the undergraduate culture she had
been experiencing at Stanford.
"What led up to 'Take the Mic' was the
feeling of being isolated, that there weren't
many black faculty and staff members," Carroll
said. "It felt like the University sprinkled us
around so that white students can have a black
person in the dorm, but not understanding that
African American students have specific needs
that weren't being addressed."
In 1970, the University established its first
black themed dorm in Cedro, where the per
centage of black residents mirrored the Univer
sity's percentage of black students. The all
freshman dorm had an immediate impact on
the class of 1974, the first class to have the op
tion of living in black theme housing.
With William Dement, professor in the de
partment of psychiatry and behavioral sciences,
as the residential fellow, the majority of the res
idents were assigned to the dorm as a result of
their pre-med academic interests. Joy Simmons
'74 was a proud resident of Cedro and spoke
fondly about her experience living in Stanford's
first black theme dorm.

"No one knew what to expect. It was
all so new," Simmons said. "For me, com
ing from a black high school, it was com
forting and supportive to be with other
Stanford students who were pre-med...

we could hang together, grow together.
Now when I look back, I see how magical
that was."

However, with a growing black stu
dent population, there was an increasing
demand for a larger residential space for
the black theme dorm. The following year,
the dorm moved to Roble, where the per
centage of black residents reached 30 per
cent.

Charles Ogletree '75 lived in Roble for
both his freshman and sophomore years as
a resident and a staff member, respectively.
What he appreciated most about Roble was
that it provided an enriching academic, cul
tural and social environment for all stu
dents.

"There were evening classes taught
on a voluntary basis by people like [Profes
sor John Gibbs] St. Clair Drake," Ogletree
said. "There would be lectures from the
Black Panther Party and students from the
Nation of Islam. They would celebrate
their religion, politics and culture in this
dorm. Everything was open and available
to every Stanford student and that was
very important."
Space continued to be an issue, how
ever, and in 1974, the dorm made its final
move to Olivo-Magnolia in the southwest
corner of Lagunita Court. In 1976, the
name of the dorm was changed to Ujamaa,
which means "economic cooperation" in
Swahili.

With a rich history serving as the dor
m's foundation, Ujamaa built and contin
ues to build upon its legacy at Stanford.
In 1988, Ujamaa provided the conver
sation and the initial stage upon which the
University implemented its "Fundamental
Standard Interpretation: Free Expression
and Discriminatory Harassment" policy,
more commonly known as the Grey Inter
pretation.

The implementation of the policy was
prompted by an incident in Ujamaa, involv
ing the posting of black-face caricatures of
Beethoven on altered Stanford Symphony
flyers. The flyers, some of which had the n

word written across them, sparked an out
cry within the dorm that eventually led to
a University investigation and, ultimately,
to the issuance of the Grey Interpretation.
The interpretation claimed that the use of
racial epithets or their equivalent is a viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard, the

code of conduct for Stanford students.
Even today, Ujamaa's presence on
campus is strongly felt.
With a required 50 percent of the dor
m's residents being black, Ujamaa is the


Courtesy of Stanford News Service
only residence, and arguably the only space on
campus, where black represents the majority.
Within that black majority, however,
there is incredible diversity. Black residents
come from across the world, represent sever
al faiths and beliefs and are spread all along
the spectrum of academic disciplines.
With such diversity among its residents,
discomfort is to be expected.
"People are coming to this space never
having lived in this kind of environment,"
said Jan Barker-Alexander, current Residential
Fellow of Ujamaa.
"It is not just students that are not black
that might not be comfortable," Barker-
Alexander said. "Even the black students are
uncomfortable, because many of them have
not been in this situation to engage in race,
class, gender and sexuality in this space. I
think that discomfort is good because it helps
you grow. It pushes you to learn."
As a white resident who lived in Ujamaa
for three years, Milton Achelpohl' 13 has heard
the criticism that white people feel uncomfort

able in Ujamaa. He thinks that the discomfort
is important.

"For me as a white student, I am learning
about the world through a different narrative,
a different lens, which is just as important be
cause it builds upon and challenges what I
have already understood about the world and
myself," Achelpohl said.
Today, the dorm continues to host edu
cational programs, presented by upperclass
men, every Thursday for its residents and for
the broader Stanford community. With an av
erage attendance of 65 students from both in
side and outside Ujamaa, the programs en
gage the Stanford community in conversation
about topics and issues impacting the African
diaspora.
