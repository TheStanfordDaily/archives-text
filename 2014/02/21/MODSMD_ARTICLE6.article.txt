# STUDENT LIFE
## A 						Month of Black Excellence 
### MINNA XIAO DESK EDITOR 
Since the beginning of February, in con
junction with Black History Month, Tayo
Amos 'l4 has uploaded one to two new videos
to her website bexcellent2ol4.tumblr.com for
her "Black Excellence" series at Stanford. The
videos, which are modeled after The New
York Times "Screen Tests", feature Stanford
students in the black community discussing
their passions, interests and ambitions. The
project will continue through the end of Feb
ruary.

Amos, who is double majoring in Science,
Technology and Society as well as Iberian and
Latin American Cultures, is no stranger to the
realm of film. A budding filmmaker, Amos was
recently selected as one of the six college stu
dents comprising "Team Oscar" who will be
delivering Oscar statuettes at this year's Acad
emy Awards.

Amos said she drew inspiration for her
project from Essence Magazine's short film
contest, which sought to challenge the stereo
typical depictions of black women in media
and Hollywood by asking each contestant to
submit a film showcasing positive, multidi
mensional portrayals of black women.
"This idea of positive representation
stuck with me," said Amos, who wanted to
frame this conversation within the context of
the Stanford community. "I want to show that
there are amazing Stanford students who look
like me and are doing really great things. They
talk about what they're interested in, what
their passions are. It's a statement.
"This was my chance to bring these peo
ple and their stories to the forefront," she
added.

For her project, Amos interviewed and
filmed 33 Stanford students over the course
of fall quarter, spent seven to nine hours a day
editing the videos during winter
break, and has consistently released
a video or two every day throughout
February.

For Chris Sackes 'l6, who was
spotlighted on Day 12 of the proj
ect, Amos' Black Excellence series
serves as way of introducing Stan
ford's black community to those
unfamiliar with it.

"I really like the concept...
for Black History month to show
how much progress has been
made in the past 40 years or so,"
he said. "For people outside of the
Stanford bubble, this project can
show that there is a strong black
community at Stanford, and there
are people who are thriving and

excelling."
In his video, Sackes spoke of
his passion for photography, his in
volvement in the a capella group
Talisman and his affinity for lan
guages.

"Black excellence means doing
the best you can... and not letting
any hindrances get in your way and
going after what you want," Sackes
said.

Tucker Bryant 'l6 remarked
that his black identity has become
much more salient since coming
to Stanford and articulated his
passion for both art and urban de
velopment in his video, which was
featured on Day 2 of the project.
Bryant said it was an honor to
be involved with a project.
"It was especially great seeing
the final product come together,
because you end up with this in
credible range of personalities

that are vastly different as individ
uals, but collectively represent a
certain commonality that laced
the fingers of our experiences to
gether in an unexpected but
graceful way," Bryant said.
So far, the response to Amos'
project has been overwhelmingly
positive.

"I've been getting emails and
Facebook friends saying, 'This is
really cool. You should do more of
this,"' Amos said. She plans to
shape these videos into a final
project for a class on digital art
and hopes that "this website stays
as a digital relic ... that people will
stumble upon five years later."
