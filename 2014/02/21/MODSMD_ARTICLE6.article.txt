## A
						Month of Black Excellence 
### MINNA XIAO DESK EDITOR 
Since the beginning of February, in con
junction with Black History Month, Tayo
Amos 'l4 has uploaded one to two new videos
to her website bexcellent2ol4.tumblr.com for
her "Black Excellence" series at Stanford. The
videos, which are modeled after The New
York Times "Screen Tests", feature Stanford
students in the black community discussing
their passions, interests and ambitions. The
project will continue through the end of Feb
ruary.

Amos, who is double majoring in Science,
Technology and Society as well as Iberian and
Latin American Cultures, is no stranger to the
realm of film. A budding filmmaker, Amos was
recently selected as one of the six college stu
dents comprising "Team Oscar" who will be
delivering Oscar statuettes at this year's Acad
emy Awards.

Amos said she drew inspiration for her
project from Essence Magazine's short film
contest, which sought to challenge the stereo
typical depictions of black women in media
and Hollywood by asking each contestant to
submit a film showcasing positive, multidi
mensional portrayals of black women.
"This idea of positive representation
stuck with me," said Amos, who wanted to
frame this conversation within the context of
the Stanford community. "I want to show that
there are amazing Stanford students who look
like me and are doing really great things. They
talk about what they're interested in, what
their passions are. It's a statement.
"This was my chance to bring these peo
ple and their stories to the forefront," she
added.

For her project, Amos interviewed and
filmed 33 Stanford students over the course
of fall quarter, spent seven to nine hours a day
