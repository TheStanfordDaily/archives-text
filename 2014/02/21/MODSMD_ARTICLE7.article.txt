National Association for the Advancement of Col
ored People)

1. The individual must decide, specifically, what he
can do, for each of us can find ways to implement
our religious ideals and democratic beliefs.

2. You and your neighbors and friends can form a
voluntary association of citizens of different races
and creeds working for open housing and social jus
tice and harmony in intergroup relations.

3. You can organize a self-survey to determine com
munity attitudes toward equal housing opportunities
in your area as was done in Seattle, Washington, and
Germantown, Ohio.

4. You can make known your willingness to welcome
a minority group member to your community, your
school, your organization or your home. You can
speak forthrightly for justice and equality.

5. You can speak forthrightly for justice and equality.

6. You can arrange for discussion on equal opportu
nity in housing.

7. You can support nondiscriminatory housing legis
lation.

8. You can insist upon an open occupancy policy if
you rent, sell or buy a home.

9. You can influence the housing industry. Builders,
mortgage lenders, real estate brokers, government
agencies must be encouraged to accept the principle
of a free housing market. They have a moral and so
cial responsibility to do so and it is in the economic
interest of the industry and the nation that the hous
ing market be broadened.
