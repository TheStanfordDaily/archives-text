# The
						F Word: Feminism and the Wage Gap
## 
### Haley Sims 
Yes. I'm talking about femi
nism. Don't groan and roll
your eyes. I know what
you're thinking: "If I have to read
one more article about how
women are treated unfairly, I'm
going to poke my eyes out!" Be
lieve me that's how I used to
feel every time I saw the word
"feminism."

I had this picture of feminists
as crazy androgynous bra burners
and breast beaters shouting about
how women are constantly treat

is the gender wage gap that exists
in the United States. There are so
many statistics and misleading in
formation surrounding this topic

fix it?

In the '6os, the passage of
the Civil Rights Act and Equal Pay

Act ended a large amount of dis
crimination in the workplace
based on gender. However, it's no
secret that a wage gap still contin
ues to exist between men and
women, and, at surface level, the
gap appears to be closing, but a
significant disparity still exists. A
recent study conducted by the
Pew Research Center concluded
that in 2012 women ages 25-34
were making hourly wages that
were 93 percent of those of men.
So women are making less, right?
What is probably more con
fusing about this is the fact that
women are now more likely to
earn an advanced degree than
