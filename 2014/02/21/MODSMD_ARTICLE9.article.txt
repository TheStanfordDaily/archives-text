# The 						F Word: Feminism and the Wage Gap
## 
### Haley Sims 
Yes. I'm talking about femi
nism. Don't groan and roll
your eyes. I know what
you're thinking: "If I have to read
one more article about how
women are treated unfairly, I'm
going to poke my eyes out!" Be
lieve me that's how I used to
feel every time I saw the word
"feminism."

I had this picture of feminists
as crazy androgynous bra burners
and breast beaters shouting about
how women are constantly treat
ed unfairly in today's world, re
placing the regal Elizabeth Cady
Stantons and Susan B. Anthonys
of old. But this image I had con
jured was extremely far removed
from the truth. Any movement

will have radicals, but feminism it
self isn't so revolutionary: Femi
nism in my not so humble opinion
is simply the idea that women
should seek equal rights.
So is it still relevant today?
Absolutely. But it might be fo
cused on the wrong issues. One
of the most well-known and pub
licized rallying points for feminists
is the gender wage gap that exists
in the United States. There are so
many statistics and misleading in
formation surrounding this topic
that it's hard to make sense of it.
Are women really making less
than men? And if so, how can we
fix it?

In the '6os, the passage of
the Civil Rights Act and Equal Pay

Act ended a large amount of dis
crimination in the workplace
based on gender. However, it's no
secret that a wage gap still contin
ues to exist between men and
women, and, at surface level, the
gap appears to be closing, but a
significant disparity still exists. A
recent study conducted by the
Pew Research Center concluded
that in 2012 women ages 25-34
were making hourly wages that
were 93 percent of those of men.
So women are making less, right?
What is probably more con
fusing about this is the fact that
women are now more likely to
earn an advanced degree than
men. Among women ages 25-32 in 2013, 38
percent are likely to have a bachelor's degree
compared with 31 percent of men. So if
women are attaining on the whole a higher
level of education than men, why are they still
being paid less?

Part of this answer can be found in the
types of jobs women hold and the areas in
which women earn their degrees. Women are
more likely to hold lower-paying "pink collar"
jobs such as teaching, childcare, nursing, wait
ressing and secretaries. There is absolutely
nothing wrong with any of these professions,
but the unfortunate truth is, they generally
pay less than male-dominated jobs.
Another and probably more significant
explanation for this difference is the fact that
women are more likely to leave their jobs or
reduce their hours in order to care for family
members. The Pew Research Center reports
that 27 percent of mothers say they quit their
jobs for family reasons while only 10 percent
of men have.

Women are indeed more likely to put
family first at the expense of work life. And
this departure can compound itself, as once
women leave the workforce they are often
likely to never return or if they do return,
they may work less or with less vigor. In com
parable careers, this means women will be
earning less and less relative to men as time
goes on since their male counterparts might
keep ascending the ranks. This is probably
where most of the wage gap between men
and women comes from.

You might argue, "But, see that's a
choice. Both women and men have the free
dom to choose if and when to leave their
work." This is true. But why are women doing
it so much more often? This gets at a much
deeper question about gender roles, cultural
norms and each family's personal decisions.
The process of caring for a new child is inher
ently different for men than for women and
expectations about childcare are different as
well. Many would agree that, for the first few
weeks of an infant's life, a mother must be a
constant presence to care for the child

feed it, put it to sleep, make sure it is safe.
Technically, though, a mother is only ab
solutely needed to help a child breastfeed.
And conflicting research even exists about
how important breastfeeding is in a child's de
velopment. A 2010 study conducted by NYU
and backed by the National Science Founda

tion analyzed numerous extant studies about
single-mother, single-father, gay and lesbian
parent households. The result: there is little to
no evidence of any "gender-based parenting
abilities." There is nothing to say that a moth
er needs to be at home to raise her children.
What does matter, however, is the
amount of love and care a parent provides for
their children. A father could provide either
of these just as well as a mother, which
means that something exists in much of our
society that propagates and encourages
women's beliefs that they must be the ones
taking the lead in raising a child in its early
years.

So how can we combat this phenome
non where women are leaving the workforce
en masse? One suggestion offered is for the
United States to offer more paid maternity
leave. The United States is one of the only
countries in the world that does not, by law,
offer paid maternity leave. Women are offered
12 weeks of unpaid leave, albeit provided on
ly if the company is large enough, and compa
nies may sometimes provide paid leave if they
choose. But as of 2011, only 28 percent of
women employed reported having access to
paid maternity leave.
However, there are also studies that
show that in many countries where paid leave
is offered, the gap between the earnings of
men and women is even larger than it is in the
United States. So this doesn't seem to be a
truly optimal solution. Furthermore, our
country has enough economic problems al
ready — how could we support mandatory
paid maternity leave? I think what would truly
be required is changes in the way people fun
damentally think about women in the work
force and child rearing.

ries. The second part will run in two weeks.

placing the regal Elizabeth Cady
Stantons and Susan B. Anthonys
of old. But this image I had con
jured was extremely far removed
from the truth. Any movement

will have radicals, but feminism it
self isn't so revolutionary: Femi
nism in my not so humble opinion
is simply the idea that women
should seek equal rights.
So is it still relevant today?
Absolutely. But it might be fo
cused on the wrong issues. One
of the most well-known and pub
licized rallying points for feminists
is the gender wage gap that exists
in the United States. There are so
many statistics and misleading in
formation surrounding this topic
that it's hard to make sense of it.
Are women really making less
than men? And if so, how can we
fix it?

In the '6os, the passage of
the Civil Rights Act and Equal Pay

Act ended a large amount of dis
crimination in the workplace
based on gender. However, it's no
secret that a wage gap still contin
ues to exist between men and
women, and, at surface level, the
gap appears to be closing, but a
significant disparity still exists. A
recent study conducted by the
Pew Research Center concluded
that in 2012 women ages 25-34
were making hourly wages that
were 93 percent of those of men.
So women are making less, right?
What is probably more con
fusing about this is the fact that
women are now more likely to
earn an advanced degree than
men. Among women ages 25-32 in 2013, 38
percent are likely to have a bachelor's degree
compared with 31 percent of men. So if
women are attaining on the whole a higher
level of education than men, why are they still
being paid less?

Part of this answer can be found in the
types of jobs women hold and the areas in
which women earn their degrees. Women are
more likely to hold lower-paying "pink collar"
jobs such as teaching, childcare, nursing, wait
ressing and secretaries. There is absolutely
nothing wrong with any of these professions,
but the unfortunate truth is, they generally
pay less than male-dominated jobs.
Another and probably more significant
explanation for this difference is the fact that
women are more likely to leave their jobs or
reduce their hours in order to care for family
members. The Pew Research Center reports
that 27 percent of mothers say they quit their
jobs for family reasons while only 10 percent
of men have.

Women are indeed more likely to put
family first at the expense of work life. And
this departure can compound itself, as once
women leave the workforce they are often
likely to never return or if they do return,
they may work less or with less vigor. In com
parable careers, this means women will be
earning less and less relative to men as time
goes on since their male counterparts might
keep ascending the ranks. This is probably
where most of the wage gap between men
and women comes from.

You might argue, "But, see that's a
choice. Both women and men have the free
dom to choose if and when to leave their
work." This is true. But why are women doing
it so much more often? This gets at a much
deeper question about gender roles, cultural
norms and each family's personal decisions.
The process of caring for a new child is inher
ently different for men than for women and
expectations about childcare are different as
well. Many would agree that, for the first few
weeks of an infant's life, a mother must be a
constant presence to care for the child

feed it, put it to sleep, make sure it is safe.
Technically, though, a mother is only ab
solutely needed to help a child breastfeed.
And conflicting research even exists about
how important breastfeeding is in a child's de
velopment. A 2010 study conducted by NYU
and backed by the National Science Founda

tion analyzed numerous extant studies about
single-mother, single-father, gay and lesbian
parent households. The result: there is little to
no evidence of any "gender-based parenting
abilities." There is nothing to say that a moth
er needs to be at home to raise her children.
What does matter, however, is the
amount of love and care a parent provides for
their children. A father could provide either
of these just as well as a mother, which
means that something exists in much of our
society that propagates and encourages
women's beliefs that they must be the ones
taking the lead in raising a child in its early
years.

So how can we combat this phenome
non where women are leaving the workforce
en masse? One suggestion offered is for the
United States to offer more paid maternity
leave. The United States is one of the only
countries in the world that does not, by law,
offer paid maternity leave. Women are offered
12 weeks of unpaid leave, albeit provided on
ly if the company is large enough, and compa
nies may sometimes provide paid leave if they
choose. But as of 2011, only 28 percent of
women employed reported having access to
paid maternity leave.
However, there are also studies that
show that in many countries where paid leave
is offered, the gap between the earnings of
men and women is even larger than it is in the
United States. So this doesn't seem to be a
truly optimal solution. Furthermore, our
country has enough economic problems al
ready — how could we support mandatory
paid maternity leave? I think what would truly
be required is changes in the way people fun
damentally think about women in the work
force and child rearing.
This column is the first in a two-part se
ries. The second part will run in two weeks.

Yes. I'm talking about femi
nism. Don't groan and roll
your eyes. I know what
you're thinking: "If I have to read
one more article about how
women are treated unfairly, I'm
going to poke my eyes out!" Be
lieve me that's how I used to
feel every time I saw the word
"feminism."

I had this picture of feminists
as crazy androgynous bra burners
and breast beaters shouting about
how women are constantly treat
