# Feminism and the Goal of Obsolescence
## 
### Kimberly Tan 
I once asked my friend if she was
a feminist. Her response: Of
course not.
Why not? Feminism, by its strict
dictionary definition, is simply the
idea of guaranteed equality be
tween men and women an idea
evident to almost everyone today.
So why is there such a distaste for
the term? Why doesn't everyone
identify as a feminist?
This aversion to the word "femi
nism" is not uncommon: The well
publicized portrayal of feminists as
angry, man-hating women has per
petuated the notion that feminism is
destructive, dangerous and to be
avoided at all costs. As a result, peo
ple who support the ideals of femi
nists do not identify as feminists,
and those who do identify as such
are marginalized and immediately
labeled as radicals.
Because of this, Stanford's
Women's Community Center
(WCC) decided to launch a cam
paign to change this negative per
ception— plastering "Of Course
I'm A Feminist" bumper stickers on
laptops, doors and water bottles all
across campus. According to the
WCC, this campaign, complete with
a punk rock font and sparkly back

ground, sought to reclaim the word
"feminist" and the full implication of
its meaning.

"The purpose was to get the
word out about the WCC as well as
the different concepts of feminism,"
said Faith Kazmi, associate dean
and director of the WCC. "The 'Of
Course I'm a Feminist' idea was
meant to be an opportunity for stu
dents to define what feminism
means to them and to invite others
to ask the question, 'why?'"
From the WCC's perspective,
these stickers have been "over
whelmingly positive," with students
specifically coming to the WCC to
request a sticker and boxes of stick
ers being sent to other universities.
Yet despite the visibility and sup
port these stickers have enjoyed,
there has also been considerable
backlash against it. Around the din
ing halls and even in my dorm, I've
heard students comment on how
much they dislike the stickers and
hate seeing them on campus.
"Why do we even need femi
nism?" someone in my dorm asked
me when I brought up the issue.
"Why do we need to point out that
we support equal rights? That
should be obvious."

Is it obvious, though?
Today, women are still paid far
less than their male counterparts,
promoted far less frequently and
subjected to far more scrutiny and
harassment at the workplace. To
day, women are still forced to make
unfair choices between family and
work because of the huge disadvan
tages they face if they take materni
ty leave, while men are not required
to make the same decisions.
Today, women account for 95
percent of domestic violence sur
vivors and 91 percent of rape sur
vivors and endure excruciating emo
tional and physical trauma, yet stu
dents still casually talk about "rap
ing" their midterms and finals. To
day, women are still objectified in
magazines and ads, paraded around
in pageants to be gawked at, and ex
ploited in mainstream music from in
ternationally respected artists. And
though many women engage in these
acts intentionally and are paid well as
a result, these incidents nevertheless
perpetuate the notion that women
are sexual objects not to be taken
seriously, but to be degraded at will.
Equal rights? That's not obvious
at all.

In reality, feminism cuts much
deeper than just shallow proclama
tions that men and women are
equal. Calling ourselves feminists
establishes recognition of the in
equalities that still remain and reaf
firms our commitment to eliminate
these underlying issues so en
trenched in the fabric of our society.
Dismissing feminism only creates
the incentive to dismiss the ideas of
gender equality altogether —to
overlook the fundamental, structur
al changes that our culture so des
perately needs.
The goal should not be to remove
"feminism" from our vernacular or
to avoid using the word altogether,
but rather to arrive at a point where
the term much like the term
"abolitionist" becomes obsolete.
We want to arrive at a point in his
tory where it means nothing to be
called a feminist, since at that point
there would be no need to draw a
distinction between the way the
world is and the way we think it
should be.

This won't happen in a day, a
week, or perhaps not even in years,
but we need to work toward
progress nonetheless. And the first

step comes through reclaiming the
word "feminism" and what it really
stands for.

"I think [the bumper stickers]
send a great message that people
are publicly willing to identify with
feminism," Kazmi concurred.
"[They] have fulfilled the purpose of
contributing to the conversations
about gender equality, sexism, pa
triarchy and feminisms in a subtle
yet sparkly way."
Displaying this sticker is thus a
simple yet enormously powerful
gesture. Visible all across campus,
these bumper stickers intend to
show us that feminists aren't radi
cals, but rather everyday individu
als all around us, committed to see
ing an idea as simple as gender
equality manifest itself in reality.
Because only once deeming
yourself a feminist doesn't immedi
ately label you as angry and ex
treme only once being a feminist
becomes the norm and not the ex
ception will we finally be able to
make true, structural progress to
ward gender equality.

there would be no need to draw a

world is and the way we think it

stands for.

"I think [the bumper stickers]
send a great message that people
are publicly willing to identify with
feminism," Kazmi concurred.

contributing to the conversations
about gender equality, sexism, pa
triarchy and feminisms in a subtle
yet sparkly way."

simple yet enormously powerful

I once asked my friend if she was
a feminist. Her response: Of
course not.
Why not? Feminism, by its strict
dictionary definition, is simply the
idea of guaranteed equality be
tween men and women an idea
evident to almost everyone today.
So why is there such a distaste for
the term? Why doesn't everyone
identify as a feminist?
This aversion to the word "femi
nism" is not uncommon: The well
publicized portrayal of feminists as
angry, man-hating women has per
petuated the notion that feminism is
destructive, dangerous and to be
avoided at all costs. As a result, peo
ple who support the ideals of femi
nists do not identify as feminists,
and those who do identify as such
are marginalized and immediately
labeled as radicals.
Because of this, Stanford's
Women's Community Center
(WCC) decided to launch a cam
paign to change this negative per
ception— plastering "Of Course
I'm A Feminist" bumper stickers on
laptops, doors and water bottles all
across campus. According to the
WCC, this campaign, complete with
a punk rock font and sparkly back

ground, sought to reclaim the word
"feminist" and the full implication of
its meaning.

"The purpose was to get the
word out about the WCC as well as
the different concepts of feminism,"
said Faith Kazmi, associate dean
and director of the WCC. "The 'Of
Course I'm a Feminist' idea was
meant to be an opportunity for stu
dents to define what feminism
means to them and to invite others
to ask the question, 'why?'"
From the WCC's perspective,
these stickers have been "over
whelmingly positive," with students
specifically coming to the WCC to
request a sticker and boxes of stick
ers being sent to other universities.
Yet despite the visibility and sup
port these stickers have enjoyed,
there has also been considerable
backlash against it. Around the din
ing halls and even in my dorm, I've
heard students comment on how
much they dislike the stickers and
hate seeing them on campus.
"Why do we even need femi
nism?" someone in my dorm asked
me when I brought up the issue.
"Why do we need to point out that
we support equal rights? That
should be obvious."

Is it obvious, though?
Today, women are still paid far
less than their male counterparts,
promoted far less frequently and
subjected to far more scrutiny and
harassment at the workplace. To
day, women are still forced to make
unfair choices between family and
work because of the huge disadvan
tages they face if they take materni
ty leave, while men are not required
to make the same decisions.
Today, women account for 95
percent of domestic violence sur
vivors and 91 percent of rape sur
vivors and endure excruciating emo
tional and physical trauma, yet stu
dents still casually talk about "rap
ing" their midterms and finals. To
day, women are still objectified in
magazines and ads, paraded around
in pageants to be gawked at, and ex
ploited in mainstream music from in
ternationally respected artists. And
though many women engage in these
acts intentionally and are paid well as
a result, these incidents nevertheless
perpetuate the notion that women
are sexual objects not to be taken
seriously, but to be degraded at will.
Equal rights? That's not obvious
at all.

In reality, feminism cuts much
deeper than just shallow proclama
tions that men and women are
equal. Calling ourselves feminists
establishes recognition of the in
equalities that still remain and reaf
firms our commitment to eliminate
these underlying issues so en
trenched in the fabric of our society.
Dismissing feminism only creates
the incentive to dismiss the ideas of
gender equality altogether —to
overlook the fundamental, structur
al changes that our culture so des
perately needs.
The goal should not be to remove
"feminism" from our vernacular or
to avoid using the word altogether,
but rather to arrive at a point where
the term much like the term
"abolitionist" becomes obsolete.
We want to arrive at a point in his
tory where it means nothing to be
called a feminist, since at that point
there would be no need to draw a
distinction between the way the
world is and the way we think it
should be.
