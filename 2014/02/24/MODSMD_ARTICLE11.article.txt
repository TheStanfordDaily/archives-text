						Breeding Ground for Entrepreneurship
## 
### Justin Wiguna 
When I came to Stanford as a
young, foolish freshman, I
knew next to nothing about
what I wanted to do with my career
or what options were available. I
had heard about consulting and fi
nance, but I did not have a clue
about what entrepreneurship
meant. Now that I am more than
two years into my college career,
my understanding of the startup
world and entrepreneurship has
flourished, and I have Stanford to
thank for that.
As a student at a university in
the heart of Silicon Valley, it's hard
to ignore the open opportunity to
start your own company. Not only
are Sand Hill Road's venture capi
talists right at our back door, but
Stanford itself also holds a plethora
of resources from entrepreneur
ship organizations like the Busi
ness Association for Stanford En
trepreneurial Students (BASES)
(full disclosure: I work for BASES)
to classes like ENGR 145: Technol
ogy Entrepreneurship or the Stan
ford GSB version of ENGR 145,
ENGR 245: Technology Entrepre
neurship and Lean Startups.
For me, BASES is where I was
first exposed to entrepreneurship.
Programs like the BASES Chal
lenge, Stanford's premier entre
preneurship business plan competi
tion, and E-Bootcamp, a global stu

dent entrepreneurship conference,
give student entrepreneurs the op
portunity to gain both financial
backing and guidance from experi
enced mentors, but more than any
thing they allow students to be en
trepreneurs with low risk without
having to go to outside accelerators
like Y Combinator or StartX al
though both are great programs.

As I see more and more success
ful companies come out of the
BASES Challenge, it has been a
growing source of inspiration.
BASES is the perfect opportunity
for anyone who wants to give a shot
at starting his or her own company.
Similarly, Stanford's academic
entrepreneurship scene includes
classes like ENGR 145 and ENGR
245, which give students a first
hand experience with building their
own startups from scratch. While
these classes teach students valu
able lessons like the lean startup
theory or how to create a business
model, they have one main goal:
build a company in ten weeks. This
environment challenges students to
push their limits and to explore the
world of entrepreneurship,
whether that means going out and
talking to customers or staying up
all night to build a product.
For some like myself, it's our
first time building a company. For
others, it's another chance to imple

ment another brilliant idea, but for
everyone, it's a space for nurturing
ideas and practicing entrepreneur
ship. A few other classes in this are
na are COMM 140: Digital Media
Entrepreneurship; MS&E 273:
Tech Venture Formations; MS&E
271: Global Entrepreneurial Mar
keting; and ME 206A/B: Entrepre
neurial Design for Extreme Afford
ability. All these classes give stu
dents the opportunity to start a
company or create a product from
the ground up.
In addition, these classes have
produced some real, successful
startups like Pulse, which was sold
to Linkedln for $9O million last
April.
My own experiences in ENGR
145 have shown me what it takes to
start my own company. It is by no
means easy, but the fact that I can
take a class where my one assign
ment is to create a business is
tremendous, because the mere ex
posure to entrepreneurship is what
pushes students to create those bil
lion-dollar companies like Snapchat
or Instagram. It's what makes
Stanford the perfect breeding
ground for young, budding entre
preneurs and the only university
that fuels its students with re
sources while providing a prime lo-
