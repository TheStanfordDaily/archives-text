## BRUIN BASHERS Card's offense sizzles in upset of UCLA 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
According to junior guard Chasson
Randle, backcourt mate Anthony
Brown has a motto: "It only takes one to
get hot."

Randle took the slogan to heart and
then some on Saturday afternoon, con
necting on a career-high seven 3-point
ers en route to scoring 26 points, lead
ing the Stanford men's basketball team
to an 83-74 upset victory over No. 23
UCLA (21-6, 10-4 Pac-12) at Maples
Pavilion. The win snapped UCLA's four
game winning streak and moved the
Cardinal (18-8, 9-5) into third place in
the Pac-12 with just four games left to
play in the conference season.
"I think it was just a very good win
for our team, a very good win for our
program," said head coach Johnny
Dawkins. "I thought UCLA came in as
hot as any team in the country, and I
thought our guys came prepared and
won a real hard-fought game."
Stanford followed Randle's example
on its way to its best shooting night of
the season, connecting on 62.2 percent
of its field goal attempts, including 55
percent (11-20) from beyond the 3-point
line. The accurate touch from the field
was enough to offset Stanford's 15
turnovers, which led to 24 UCLA
points.
Newly minted as Stanford's all-time
blocks leader, senior forward Josh
Huestis turned in perhaps his best per
formance of the season in support of
Randle. The Montana native tied a ca
reer high with 22 points on 8-of-12
shooting and added six rebounds, five
blocks and three assists, all the while

Junior guard Chasson Randle (center) lit up the Bruins from long range on Saturday, nailing seven of
his 10 attempted 3-pointers en route to an impressive 26-point performance in Stanford's upset win.
spending a large portion of the af
ternoon shutting down Jordan
Adams, UCLA's leading scorer.
Adams was held to just eight points
on 2-of-7 shooting, nine points below
his season average.
Brown was also superb for the
Cardinal, scoring 18 points on 5-of-8
shooting to go with six rebounds and
three assists, while also drawing
perhaps the toughest defensive as
signment of all in UCLAs Kyle An
derson. Anderson the team's sec
ond-leading scorer, top rebounder
and assists leader struggled to
find the basket. The sophomore fin
ished with just six points on 3-of-8
shooting.
A competitive battle throughout,
the game was knotted at 18 with
10:33 remaining in the first half when

Stanford, spurred by its bench play
ers, embarked on a 12-0 run to open
up a 30-18 lead. After a nifty feed
from senior Dwight Powell led to a
Huestis dunk, UCLAs Tony Parker
missed a pair of free throws to give
Stanford the ball back. Randle
promptly nailed his fourth 3-pointer
of the first half to push the Cardinal's
lead to five before the bench had its
magic Maples moment.
Freshman guard Marcus Allen
rebounded a missed jumper by An
derson, leading to a rare Randle
miss on Stanford's next possession.
Sophomore Grant Verhoeven cor
ralled the miss that failed to touch
iron, and with the shot clock wind
ing down, Allen nimbly maneuvered
his way through three UCLA de
fenders for an acrobatic scoop shot
off the glass, sending the home
crowd into a tizzy. Stanford came up
with another stop on UCLAs ensu
ing possession, and 28 seconds later,
senior Robbie Lemons connected on
a 3 from the left corner that finally

forced UCLA coach Steve Alford to
call a timeout.
Stanford used the run to take a
38-30 lead into halftime despite a
scoreless frame from Powell, the
team's second-leading scorer. Pow
ell had been bloodied to the point of
needing stitches during the Cardi
nal's victory over USC on Thursday
and was sporting a protective head
band against the Bruins.
Despite the first-half struggles,
Powell responded early and often in
the second half, scoring nine of
Stanford's first 14 points in the peri
od. The last of those nine points
came on a spectacular double-alley
oop dunk via Randle and Brown
that was featured as the No. 1 play
on Sports Center's Top 10 plays, and
more importantly, gave Stanford a
52-39 lead with 16:09 left to play.
Coach Dawkins recognized at
halftime that if the Cardinal was go
ing to succeed, Powell would have to
be more involved in the second half.
"We made an emphasis to try to

get [Powell] the ball early to start
the second half," Dawkins said. "I
think he had the first nine points or
so. He didn't get very many touches
in the first half. We knew we were
going to need him if we were going
to have a chance to be successful."
Although Powell's outburst
opened up a big lead for Stanford,
the Bruins calmly collected them
selves, and within a span of six min
utes and 16 seconds, UCLA had
closed the gap to three at 60-57.
The second-half struggles that
had plagued the Cardinal on the of
fensive end in its losses to Arizona
and Washington had reappeared,
and Dawkins was forced to call a
timeout.
However, this time around, Stan
ford had answers to its problems.
Brown knocked down a deep 3-
pointer on the Cardinal's next pos
session with just two seconds re
maining on the shot clock to push
the lead back to six, and after a
UCLA timeout and a stop on the de

fensive end, Randle knocked down
his sixth triple of the afternoon. The
lead was nine, and UCLA would
never again get closer than four.
"Yeah, [the 3-pointer sequence]
was huge," Huestis said. "Basket
ball is a game of runs and UCLA
went on theirs. And you know, there
are games where if you don't re
spond, that game could've easily
changed the outcome. But with
Anthony and Chasson hitting those
shots, it was a huge momentum
changer for us. It was a big swing
and it got us back on track."
Stanford has now won five of its
last six as it heads down the final
stretch. NCAA tournament hopes
have never been higher for the Cardi
nal this season than they are now, and
a split of the team's final four games
down the stretch should be enough to
get Stanford back to the Big Dance
for the first time since 2008.
