## BRUIN BASHERS Card's offense sizzles in upset of UCLA 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
According to junior guard Chasson
Randle, backcourt mate Anthony
Brown has a motto: "It only takes one to
get hot."

Randle took the slogan to heart and
then some on Saturday afternoon, con
necting on a career-high seven 3-point
ers en route to scoring 26 points, lead
ing the Stanford men's basketball team
to an 83-74 upset victory over No. 23
UCLA (21-6, 10-4 Pac-12) at Maples
Pavilion. The win snapped UCLA's four
game winning streak and moved the
Cardinal (18-8, 9-5) into third place in
the Pac-12 with just four games left to
play in the conference season.
"I think it was just a very good win
for our team, a very good win for our
program," said head coach Johnny
Dawkins. "I thought UCLA came in as
hot as any team in the country, and I
thought our guys came prepared and
won a real hard-fought game."
Stanford followed Randle's example
on its way to its best shooting night of
the season, connecting on 62.2 percent
of its field goal attempts, including 55
percent (11-20) from beyond the 3-point
line. The accurate touch from the field
was enough to offset Stanford's 15
turnovers, which led to 24 UCLA
points.
Newly minted as Stanford's all-time
blocks leader, senior forward Josh
Huestis turned in perhaps his best per
formance of the season in support of
Randle. The Montana native tied a ca
reer high with 22 points on 8-of-12
shooting and added six rebounds, five
blocks and three assists, all the while
