## Stanford sweeps SoCal trip 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
No. 5 Stanford women's basket
ball (26-2, 14-1 Pac-12) clinched a
share of its 14th consecutive Pac-12
title on Friday with a 64-59 come
from-behind win against USC (16-11,
9-6). The Cardinal had to overcome a
19-point deficit to secure the win
tied for the largest deficit it has ever
overcome and eighth largest come
back in NCAA history. Then, on Sun
day, the Card won the Pac-12 title
outright by beating UCLA (12-16, 6-
10) 65-56.

USC led the Cardinal from its
opening possession, leading the en
tirety of the first half and until about
nine minutes were remaining in the
game. However, it was at that point
when Stanford scored 12 straight
points to take the lead 49-43, led by
eight straight points from senior for
ward Chiney Ogwumike.
After a beating at Maples last
month, the Trojans played competi
tively for 40 minutes and wouldn't al
low the Cardinal to dominate on
USC's home court. USC made the
first five of its six shots from behind
the arc to start the game while effec
tively keeping the ball away from Og
wumike and forcing Stanford to
make poor shot selections and nine
turnovers in the first half. Ogwumike
was held to just nine points and two
rebounds in the first half, but filled
her role as team leader in the second
half to finish with 27 points and sev
en rebounds.
With six minutes remaining in the
first half, USC took its largest lead of
the game at 32-13. But during an of
ficial TV timeout with 3:51 to go,
head coach Tara VanDerveer called a
timeout to make adjustments and the
Cardinal stepped back onto the court
ready to take care of business. Stan
ford's defense kicked into high gear
with four minutes remaining in the
half, holding USC scoreless for the
remainder of the period, while man
aging nine points of its own, includ
ing a 3-pointer by junior guard Bon-

nie Samuelson with 10 seconds re
maining.
"Our [Washington] loss really
taught us a lot about ourselves, but
we knew at the 10-minute mark of
the first half tonight that a lot of
game was left and it wasn't a loss,"
Ogwumike said. "That helped us
play motivated on defense."
Stanford trailed USC 37-30 at
the break after a half dominated
mostly by the Trojans' impressive
scoring and Stanford's inability to
finish at the basket and take care of
the ball. However, the second half
was all Stanford, as it played lock
down defense and played with com
posure on the offensive end, taking
much better shots rather than tak
ing the first open look.
"We have to look at things and
make a decision to play harder
right from the get-go," VanDerveer
said.
Stanford led by as much as nine
with six minutes remaining, but
USC's Ariya Crook kept the Tro
jans in the game, leading her team
with 24 points. With 18 seconds to
play, Crook cut the Cardinal's lead
to just three by knocking down a 3
from the top of the key. When USC
was forced to start fouling, Samuel
son seemed to be the one with the
ball in her hands often and iced the
game by going 4-of-4 from the line
in the final minute of play. Samuel
son finished the game with 14
points and four assists.
"I know that [making free
throws] is one of my jobs in close
games, so it was good practice for
me to be in that situation," Samuel
son said.
Against the UCLA Bruins on
their Senior Night, VanDerveer
tried out a different starting lineup
with Samuelson and freshmen Eri
ca McCall and Brianna Roberson
joining junior point guard Amber
Orrange and senior forward
Chiney Ogwumike. For Roberson
and Samuelson, it was the first
start of their careers. Roberson
started the game 2-of-2 in shooting
and provided the Card with its
opening five points as Ogwumike
struggled to connect underneath
the basket, shooting l-of-6 from the
field to start.
The Card trailed the majority of
the first half but pulled ahead just
before halftime to head into the
locker room with a 29-25 advantage.
In the second half, Ogwumike
turned in one of her best defensive
performances of the season, finish

ing with five blocks and four steals
to go with her 26 points and 15 re
bounds. Orrange also led the Card's
defensive and offensive efforts with
13 points, two steals and three as
sists, while senior forward Mikaela

Ruef grabbed 11 rebounds.
The Card will return to the

Farm for its final weekend of Pae
-12 regular season play, with a
Thursday matchup against Wash
ington and a Saturday date with
Washington State.
