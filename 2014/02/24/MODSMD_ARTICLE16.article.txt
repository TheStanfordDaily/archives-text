# TEXAS TROUBLE
## Stanford salvages finale of threegame set in Texas 
### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
Another series, another sweep
avoided on Sunday by Stanford's
baseball team.

The Cardinal (3-4) which
once again sent out three fresh
man starters, making it the only
team in the country to have start
ed a freshman pitcher every
game this season had its work
cut out against Texas (5-3) at

UFCU Disch-Falk Field. After
getting blown out in the opener
and losing on a walk-off wild pitch
on Saturday, the pressure was on
to salvage the series with a win.
In front of a hostile crowd that
averaged 6,470 spectators over
the three-game set, Stanford
once again provided strong run
support for Chris Viall en route to
an 11-5 win.
Cal Quantrill got the start on
Friday, hoping to build on an up
and-down performance in the
season opener. However, he
struggled with command and
found himself throwing out of the
stretch early and often.
After the first inning, the
score was knotted at one, with
both teams having loaded the
bases with one out but only able
to push one run across.
But in the bottom of the sec
ond, Texas broke the game open
and never looked back. With a
man on third and two outs,

Quantrill was poised to work out
of another tough situation after
working Texas senior second
baseman iy Marlow into a 0-2
count. After fouling off three
pitches, Marlow swung and
missed on the sixth pitch of the
at-bat but reached first on a
dropped third strike. That mis
play opened the floodgates, which
quickly ended Quantrill's second
outing. After the strikeout, a
triple, single, walk, single and
double ensued, plating five runs
and giving the Longhorns a 6-1
lead that it never surrendered as
it easily took game one by a score
of 9-3.
Quantrill was pulled after 64
pitches, having allowed six runs
on six hits and three walks in two
innings. Although the Cardinal
offense did have nine hits in the
game, it struck out 11 times and
left nine men on base, the main
causes of its low run production.
On Saturday, Stanford showed
some resilience, coming from be
hind twice to tie the game after
freshman Brett Hanewich's
strong outing, in which he lasted
5.1 innings and shut out the
Longhorns after allowing two
runs one earned in the first.
The score remained 2-0 until
the seventh, as Texas junior
southpaw Dillon Peters was deal
ing, allowing just three Stanford
baserunners over the first six in
nings. But in the seventh, consec
utive singles from junior Austin
Slater and junior Alex Blandino
set up the Cardinal with runners
on first and second with nobody
out. Later in the inning, sopho
more Zach Hoffpauir hammered
a single to left with two outs and
the bases loaded, tying the game
at two and giving him his fifth hit
and seventh RBI of the season.
Texas quickly regained the
lead in the bottom half with an
RBI single from senior Mark
Peyton, who went 8-for-10 with
four RBIs in the series. In the top
of the eighth, Stanford once again
tied the game with a two-out ral
ly: a single followed by a Blandino
RBI double down the left field
line.
In the bottom of the ninth,
sophomore Marcus Brakeman
looked to extend the game into
extras after escaping a jam in the
seventh and pitching a 1-2-3
eighth. But after a groundout to
open the inning, he suddenly lost

three runs, two RBIs and a walk to lead Stanford past Texas in the
finale of a three-game series on Sunday.
command, with 15 of his next 19
pitches ending up outside the
strike zone. With the bases loaded,
two outs and a 1-2 count, he threw
a wild pitch, allowing Texas to walk
off with a 4-3 victory.
On Sunday, freshman starter
Chris Viall gave the Cardinal of
fense all it needed, allowing just
one run over 4.1 innings. Stanford
exploded for 11 runs in the game,
led by Blandino, who went 3-for-4
in the game with 2 RBIs. Blandino
has gotten a hit in each of the
Card's first seven games and is qui
etly hitting .417 for the season.
Junior Wayne Taylor went 2-
for-5 in the game, picking up a
three-run bases-clearing triple in
the second inning that first broke
the game open at 4-0. From there,
Stanford cruised and earned an 11-
5 victory that was shortened to
eight innings to accommodate the
team's travel plans.
Although it has not been consis
tent enough in scoring opportuni

ties, the Cardinal offense has
passed the baton of responsibility
to the team's starting pitching af
ter hitting .297 in the series. While
they are only two appearances into
their collegiate careers, Stanford's
freshman starters have only
pitched half of the team's innings
(30.1 of 60.2) and have a combined
4.75 ERA.
"It's a learning process," said
head coach Mark Marquess. "Cal
didn't pitch as well as he did the
first time. Hanewich pitched well
and gave us a chance to win. It's
week-to-week and that's how they
learn. The competition we're play
ing is very difficult, so if you don't
play well or pitch well, they usually
take advantage of you. But that's
why we [play tough competition]:
to find out where we need to im
prove."
The Cardinal will host San
Francisco this Tuesday at Sunken
Diamond at 5:30 p.m., once again
hoping to gather some momentum
ahead of a weekend road trip to
Nashville, Tenn., to take on Van
derbilt.
