# Should Johnny Football go No. 1 overall?
## 
### Michael Peterson 
With the NFL Draft
approaching and
the NFL Combine
underway, one
question looms
over the proceedings: who will the
Texans take with the first overall
pick? Or, to be more specific, will the
Texans gamble on Johnny Manziel?
As Johnny said and I strongly be
lieve, if the Texans pass on Manziel, it
will be one of the biggest mistakes
they have made in the short history of
their franchise.
Johnny Manziel will become a
franchise quarterback.
For all the criticisms he's re
ceived heading into the draft,
Manziel doesn't get nearly enough
praise. His elusiveness, ability to
extend plays and unheralded accu
racy turned Texas A&M from a 7-6
Big-12 team in 2011 under future
Miami Dolphins quarterback Ryan
Tannehill to an 11-2 SEC team that
won on the road against eventual
national champion Alabama. Texas
A&M played in the Meineke Car
Care Bowl in 2011. A year later, it
torched highly regarded SEC de
fenses with Manziel.
Obviously, Johnny's not the only
one who deserves credit for the
quick turnaround. Texas A&M
head coach Kevin Sumlin's arrival
coincided with Manziel's start as
well. The Aggies possessed a tal
ented offensive line highlighted by
Luke Joeckel (who was drafted last
year) and Jake Matthews. They al
so touted potential first-round wide
receiver Mike Evans. But Manziel
is a special quarterback.
As the Seahawks demonstrated
in the Super Bowl, a truly great de
fense can stop a great offensive sys
tem. The Seahawks matched up
with the Broncos receivers and did
n't allow Peyton Manning enough
time in the pocket to wait for a re
ceiver to finally break free. As a re
sult, the Broncos offense never got
going.
However, great defenses can't
prepare or game plan for broken
plays. At some point in the progres
sion of a play that has been extend
ed by the quarterback's elusiveness
or mobility, there will either be an
open receiver or a lane for the
quarterback to run. It's simply im
possible to trap a fast, agile quar
terback who has escaped the pock
et while also covering every receiv
er.
If you've watched Johnny
Manziel at all over the past two
years, you know that he specializes
in extending and creating big plays
after it seems like the play is over.
His ability to escape from a col
lapsed pocket and somehow slip
from the grasps of big defensive
linemen paid dividends for the Ag
gies. Whatever team drafts
Manziel will inherit his ability to
turn negative-yardage plays into
touchdowns.
Yes, Manziel is small. More than
his height, I worry about his body
holding up after receiving hits from
NFL defenses. He also needs to be
willing to play more in the pocket
and not always run at the first sign
of danger.
But it wasn't like Manziel was
playing in the MAC or the AAC. He
was playing in the SEC. Many of
the players he faced in the SEC he
will see again in the NFL. If he can
stay healthy taking hits from SEC
defenses, I trust that he can stay
healthy in the NFL. He also
showed great improvement in his
passing at Texas A&M last season,
with a two percent increase in his
completion rate (68 percent to 70
percent), 11 more touchdowns
through the air (26 to 37) and a
yard more on each passing attempt
(8.54 yards per attempt to 9.59
yards per attempt) from 2012 to
2013.
Manziel will develop into a fran
chise quarterback because he not
only possesses this invaluable trait
to extend plays, but he also has all
of the tools he needs to be a great
pocket passer. He has the arm
strength to throw from the pocket.
He has impeccable accuracy on his
short to mid-range throws. His de
cision-making could improve, as ev
idenced by some of his 22 intercep
tions, but that will come with time.
Brett Favre holds the record for
the most interceptions in the histo
ry of the NFL, yet no one questions
his place as one of the greatest
quarterbacks of all time.

In some ways, Manziel compares
well to Brett Favre. Coming out of
Southern Miss, Favre was seen as
having a cannon arm, an ability to
make plays from nothing and ques
tionable decision-making skills. Favre
also beat a ranked Alabama team on
the road while in college.
Like Favre, Johnny Manziel will
lead an NFL team to a Super Bowl in
his career. He already has all of the
tools he needs to become a franchise
quarterback and his competitiveness
will drive him to continually get bet
ter.

Five years from now, I will either
delete this column from The Daily's
website in embarrassment that I
thought Manziel would be great or I
will Tweet it around to show that I
knew what was coming. Something
tells me it will be the latter.

Clearly, Michael Peterson was sip
ping on some Bayless-brand Manziel
flavored Kool-Aid while writing this
column. Fill him in on any possible
antidotes at mrpeters@stanford.edu

With the NFL Draft
approaching and
the NFL Combine
underway, one
question looms
over the proceedings: who will the
Texans take with the first overall
pick? Or, to be more specific, will the
Texans gamble on Johnny Manziel?
As Johnny said and I strongly be
lieve, if the Texans pass on Manziel, it
will be one of the biggest mistakes
they have made in the short history of
their franchise.
Johnny Manziel will become a
franchise quarterback.
For all the criticisms he's re
ceived heading into the draft,
Manziel doesn't get nearly enough
praise. His elusiveness, ability to
extend plays and unheralded accu
racy turned Texas A&M from a 7-6
Big-12 team in 2011 under future
Miami Dolphins quarterback Ryan
Tannehill to an 11-2 SEC team that
won on the road against eventual
national champion Alabama. Texas
A&M played in the Meineke Car
Care Bowl in 2011. A year later, it
torched highly regarded SEC de
fenses with Manziel.
Obviously, Johnny's not the only
one who deserves credit for the
quick turnaround. Texas A&M
head coach Kevin Sumlin's arrival
coincided with Manziel's start as
well. The Aggies possessed a tal
ented offensive line highlighted by
Luke Joeckel (who was drafted last
year) and Jake Matthews. They al
so touted potential first-round wide
receiver Mike Evans. But Manziel
is a special quarterback.
As the Seahawks demonstrated
in the Super Bowl, a truly great de
fense can stop a great offensive sys
tem. The Seahawks matched up
with the Broncos receivers and did
n't allow Peyton Manning enough
time in the pocket to wait for a re
ceiver to finally break free. As a re
sult, the Broncos offense never got
going.
However, great defenses can't
prepare or game plan for broken
plays. At some point in the progres
sion of a play that has been extend
ed by the quarterback's elusiveness
or mobility, there will either be an
open receiver or a lane for the
quarterback to run. It's simply im
possible to trap a fast, agile quar
terback who has escaped the pock
et while also covering every receiv
er.
If you've watched Johnny
Manziel at all over the past two
years, you know that he specializes
in extending and creating big plays
after it seems like the play is over.
His ability to escape from a col
lapsed pocket and somehow slip
from the grasps of big defensive
linemen paid dividends for the Ag
gies. Whatever team drafts
Manziel will inherit his ability to
turn negative-yardage plays into
touchdowns.
Yes, Manziel is small. More than
his height, I worry about his body
holding up after receiving hits from
NFL defenses. He also needs to be
willing to play more in the pocket
and not always run at the first sign
of danger.
But it wasn't like Manziel was
playing in the MAC or the AAC. He
was playing in the SEC. Many of
the players he faced in the SEC he
will see again in the NFL. If he can
stay healthy taking hits from SEC
defenses, I trust that he can stay
healthy in the NFL. He also
showed great improvement in his
passing at Texas A&M last season,
with a two percent increase in his
completion rate (68 percent to 70
percent), 11 more touchdowns
through the air (26 to 37) and a
yard more on each passing attempt
(8.54 yards per attempt to 9.59
yards per attempt) from 2012 to
2013.
Manziel will develop into a fran
chise quarterback because he not
only possesses this invaluable trait
to extend plays, but he also has all
of the tools he needs to be a great
pocket passer. He has the arm
strength to throw from the pocket.
He has impeccable accuracy on his
short to mid-range throws. His de
cision-making could improve, as ev
idenced by some of his 22 intercep
tions, but that will come with time.
Brett Favre holds the record for
the most interceptions in the histo
ry of the NFL, yet no one questions
his place as one of the greatest
quarterbacks of all time.

In some ways, Manziel compares
well to Brett Favre. Coming out of
Southern Miss, Favre was seen as
having a cannon arm, an ability to
make plays from nothing and ques
tionable decision-making skills. Favre
also beat a ranked Alabama team on
the road while in college.
Like Favre, Johnny Manziel will
lead an NFL team to a Super Bowl in
his career. He already has all of the
tools he needs to become a franchise
quarterback and his competitiveness
will drive him to continually get bet
ter.

Five years from now, I will either
delete this column from The Daily's
website in embarrassment that I
thought Manziel would be great or I
will Tweet it around to show that I
knew what was coming. Something
tells me it will be the latter.
