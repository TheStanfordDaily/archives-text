# Stanford swamps the Gators
## 
### FIONA NOONAN STAFF WRITER 
The No. 3 Stanford women's
tennis team (7-0) blanked No. 5
Florida (8-2) during a sunny dual
match at the Taube Family Tennis
Stadium on Sunday afternoon in
front of an excited and unusually
large crowd as it raced to a 7-0 vic
tory.

The match continued what has
become an intense women's tennis
rivalry since the Cardinal beat
Florida 4-3 in 2010 to win the
NCAA championship. Coming in
to Sunday, Stanford had a 4-2
record against the Gators in the
teams' last six matches, the most
recent of which was in May 2013
during the NCAA semifinals,
which Stanford won 4-3 in dra
matic fashion. The Card would go
on to win the NCAA champi
onship to clinch Stanford's 19th
consecutive Director's Cup.
Sunday's match, which ended
at 7-0 once singles and doubles
had both finished, was expected
to be much closer given the heat
ed rivalry and high calibers of
both squads. Still, the Gators
gave the Cardinal a run for its
money in hard-fought matches
until sophomore Krista Harde
beck clinched the Stanford victo
ry by beating No. 19 Alexandra
Cercone on court No. 2 in a re
peat of her championship-decid
ing performance in the NCAA
semifinals last year.
The day opened with Stanford
taking the doubles point quickly.
The No. 17 pair of senior Kristie
Ahn and freshman Carol Zhao
beat No. 14 Florida duo Sofie

Oyen and Belinda Woolcock, 8-5.
Then, the team of freshman Caro
line Doyle and Hardebeck beat
Florida's Olivia Janowicz and Ste
fani Stojic, 8-1, to clinch the point.
"We had been struggling a bit
[on doubles court No. 3], so for
[Caroline and Krista] to come out
and win 8-1, it made the right
statement that we are all ready to
come to the party now," Stanford
head coach Lele Forood told
GoStanford.com after the match.
"I think that was really big."
As the singles matches began
and the players worked through
the unseasonably warm weather,
Stanford quickly went up five
sets to Florida's one, starting
with No. 51 Zhao capturing the
first set for Stanford. Junior
Ellen Tsay was the last to finish
her first set, as she battled No. 38
Belinda Woolcock on court No. 5
in an intense tiebreaker that end
ed with Woolcock winning 7-5 to
take the set.
In the second sets, Zhao set
the tone for the rest of the dual
by capping off a 6-1, 6-3 victory
over No. 14 Brianna Morgan.
Zhao was on point against Mor
gan all afternoon and was re
warded by being the first off of
the court. Fellow freshman No.
25 Taylor Davidson followed
quickly thereafter, winning her
match on court No. 4, 6-2, 6-2.
After Hardebeck secured Stan
ford's victory on court No. 2, Ahn,
playing in position No. 1, fought
hard to avoid a second consecutive
loss and ended up on top against
No. 11 Janowicz, winning 6-2, 7-5.
Tsay rounded out the afternoon by
finishing her marathon match 6-7,

6-4,1-0 (4).
A strong team victory against
quality competition like Florida
will serve Stanford well as it pre
pares to begin Pac-12 competition.
"Everyone came out here and

gave it their all today," Hardebeck
told GoStanford.com. "[lt's] im
portant to get a taste of what it's
like against a really top team. I
thought the energy was really
high today."

Stanford women's tennis next
faces Cal at noon on Saturday in
Berkeley.
