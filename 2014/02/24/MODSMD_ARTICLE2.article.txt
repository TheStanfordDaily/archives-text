## Attendance at Parents' Weekend increases 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
Close to 2,000 households registered for
Parents' Weekend this year, reflecting a grad
ual increase in the event's attendance.
In each of the previous three years, be
tween 1,500 and 1,700 households have regis
tered for Parents' Weekend, according to Of
fice of Special Events executive director
Elaine Enos. Enos estimated that approxi
mately 3,600 to 3,900 Stanford family mem
bers visited campus for this year's event.
"It's been really exciting to see the level of

turnout that we're having," she said.
Enos said that 51 percent of registered at
tendees were related to the Class of 2017, and
noted that grandparents and siblings have
constituted a growing percentage of the total
number of attendees.
The programming of Parents' Weekend re
mained unchanged from previous years due to
the continued interest in particular events, ac
cording to Enos.
"The basic structure is virtually the same
as far as classes, tours, a welcome by Provost
[John] Etchemendy ['B2] and a Q&A with
[President John] Hennessy," Enos said.

"These are key traditional things that are suc
cessful and we have continued numbers [of at
tendance] for those."
Many parents expressed their apprecia
tion for the chance to have questions about the
University answered by administrators and
faculty.
"I think there were a lot of concerns that
parents had," said Mark Chen, a Class of 2017
parent. "We feel more understanding and
much at ease because our questions were be
ing answered. That makes a big difference."

Parents' Weekend saw an increase in attendance this year, with almost 4,000 relatives of Stanford students spending the weekend on campus.
The University hosted three days of programming, including "Back to School" classes and a Q&A with President John Hennessy.
Enos also noted that the Uni
versity made sure to offer "Back to
School" classes those offered to
parents during Parents' Weekend
that came from different areas
of studies and from professors
that haven't taught a class to par
ents before. Class subjects are of
ten chosen to reflect topics that
are trending at the time, either ge
ographically or in a given area of
research.
Enos added that these "Back to
School" classes are often very
popular and serve as a principal
draw for parents visiting campus.
"We have some parents who
come to Stanford just for the
classes, and they make a point of
making it to as many as they can,"
Enos said. "And they end up hav
ing conversations and discussions
with other parents there."
Enos expressed particular
pride in the resource fair that was
set up near the Parents' Weekend
registration tables at Arrillaga
Alumni Center. The fair included
more than 20 organizations that
addressed various aspects of cam
pus, ranging from Commence
ment and the Vaden Health Cen

ter to sororities and overseas trav
el.
Other programming offered
during Parents' Weekend included
tours of the Cantor Arts Center,
the Jasper Ridge Biological Re
serve and the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC). Open
house tours were expanded to in
corporate other labs like the Volk
swagen Automotive Innovation
Lab (VAIL).
Of course, for many parents,
spending time with their Stanford
student was a priority.
"[Parents' Weekend] gives us
an opportunity to meet our daugh
ter's friends and how she operates
on campus," said Nancy Zane, a
Class of 2017 parent. "In addition
to that, we had a great time hang
ing out on campus with her, eating
in Palo Alto and hiking on the Dish
and seeing that [Stanford] is well
worth it."
"Spending time with Mike
he was the main attraction," said
the parents of Mike Precup 'l7
when asked what their favorite
part of the weekend had been.
"But we enjoyed Parents' Week
end a lot. The campus itself is so
peaceful and beautiful. We ran in
to the band which was ... a little
different than what we're used to."
