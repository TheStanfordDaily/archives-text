## Attendance at Parents' Weekend increases 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
Close to 2,000 households registered for
Parents' Weekend this year, reflecting a grad
ual increase in the event's attendance.
In each of the previous three years, be
tween 1,500 and 1,700 households have regis
tered for Parents' Weekend, according to Of
fice of Special Events executive director
Elaine Enos. Enos estimated that approxi
mately 3,600 to 3,900 Stanford family mem
bers visited campus for this year's event.
"It's been really exciting to see the level of

turnout that we're having," she said.
Enos said that 51 percent of registered at
tendees were related to the Class of 2017, and
noted that grandparents and siblings have
constituted a growing percentage of the total
number of attendees.
The programming of Parents' Weekend re
mained unchanged from previous years due to
the continued interest in particular events, ac
cording to Enos.
"The basic structure is virtually the same
as far as classes, tours, a welcome by Provost
[John] Etchemendy ['B2] and a Q&A with
[President John] Hennessy," Enos said.

"These are key traditional things that are suc
cessful and we have continued numbers [of at
tendance] for those."
Many parents expressed their apprecia
tion for the chance to have questions about the
University answered by administrators and
faculty.
"I think there were a lot of concerns that
parents had," said Mark Chen, a Class of 2017
parent. "We feel more understanding and
much at ease because our questions were be
ing answered. That makes a big difference."
