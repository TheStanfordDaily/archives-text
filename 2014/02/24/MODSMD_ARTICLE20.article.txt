# Water polo third at UCI Invite
## 
### DYLAN FUGEL STAFF WRITER 
In a field as stacked as the
field at this weekend's UC-Irvine
Invitational, it was always going
to be difficult for the No. 2 Stan
ford Cardinal women's water po
lo team to escape unscathed. The
tournament played host to 14 of
the top 18 teams in the country,
and all four groups represented
the cream of the NCAA. Stanford
(10-1) would eventually take
home third place after beating
Pacific and No. 7 Arizona State
before losing to No. 3 UCLA in
the semis and then recovering to
beat No. 4 Cal in the third-place
match.

Saturday's play saw the Car
dinal pull off yet another in a se
ries of stellar performances, dis
missing Pacific 11-3 in a victory
that was all the more sweet be
cause of its lack of intrigue. Stan
ford scored four unanswered
goals in the first quarter and
from then on, the result was nev
er in doubt.
The Cardinal was paced by
sophomore driver Anna Yelizaro
va, senior driver Kaley Dodson
and junior two-meter Ashley
Grossman, each of whom had two
goals in the victory. Dodson
would go on to score six goals for
the day after adding a further
four goals against ASU. Unfortu
nately for the Cardinal, this was
about as relaxing as the tourna
ment would get.
The Cardinal followed up that
performance with a thrilling and
hard-fought victory over Arizona
State, in which Sun Devils fresh
man center Alkistis Benekou had
a fantastic day's play, scoring five
against No. 11 San Jose State in
the opening-round match before
adding another two against Stan

ford in the quarterfinal matchup.
The two teams were knotted
throughout and a clear lead was
very difficult to come by before
halftime, as goals from Grossman
and senior two-meter Annika
Dries were immediately pegged
back by ASU junior utility player
Liz Kreek and junior defender
Ao Gao. Stanford's greater pedi
gree began to show in the third
period, as the Cardinal came out
energized after the break and
quickly extended its lead to 11-6,
but this lead only led to a pro
longed period of sloppy play that
allowed the Sun Devils to slowly
cut into the deficit. Two goals in
the final eight seconds made the
game's climax thrilling, but Stan
ford would hold on to win 11-10.
Stanford moved on toward the
semifinals knowing that it would
have to play better in order to get

past No. 3 UCLA, whom it had
defeated 8-4 at the Stanford Invi
tational earlier this season. How
ever, the Card got off to an awful
start and conceded the first three
goals of the matchup. That
marked the first time all season
that Stanford had been down by
more than two goals and put the
Card in an early hole from which
it could never quite recover.
Goals from Dries and fresh
man driver Jamie Neushul
brought the Cardinal within two
going into the end of the first pe
riod, but by then, the damage had
been done and the Cardinal was
constantly attempting to erase
the deficit. All goals during the
rest of the game were alternated
and the Cardinal was handed its
first loss of the season.
Coming off a loss for the first
time all year, attention then

turned to how the Cardinal would
react in the face of adversity. The
answer: positively.
The Cardinal, paced by four
goals from sophomore driver
Maggie Steffens and a hat trick
from Yelizarova, beat local rivals
Cal 14-8 in what was an impres
sive performance considering the
feelings of letdown that could
have surfaced after being
knocked out in the semifinals.
Steffens and Yelizarova were
ably supported by Grossman and
Neushul, both of whom netted
two goals. Stanford held a two
goal lead after the first period
and a four-goal lead at halftime,
ending the day on a high note and
resuming the solid play that had
characterized its season thus far.
The perfect start might have

In a field as stacked as the
field at this weekend's UC-Irvine
Invitational, it was always going
to be difficult for the No. 2 Stan
ford Cardinal women's water po
lo team to escape unscathed. The
tournament played host to 14 of
the top 18 teams in the country,
and all four groups represented
the cream of the NCAA. Stanford
(10-1) would eventually take
home third place after beating
Pacific and No. 7 Arizona State
before losing to No. 3 UCLA in
the semis and then recovering to
beat No. 4 Cal in the third-place
match.

Saturday's play saw the Car
dinal pull off yet another in a se
ries of stellar performances, dis
missing Pacific 11-3 in a victory
that was all the more sweet be
cause of its lack of intrigue. Stan
ford scored four unanswered
goals in the first quarter and
from then on, the result was nev
er in doubt.
The Cardinal was paced by
sophomore driver Anna Yelizaro
va, senior driver Kaley Dodson
and junior two-meter Ashley
Grossman, each of whom had two
goals in the victory. Dodson
would go on to score six goals for
the day after adding a further
four goals against ASU. Unfortu
nately for the Cardinal, this was
about as relaxing as the tourna
ment would get.
The Cardinal followed up that
performance with a thrilling and
hard-fought victory over Arizona
State, in which Sun Devils fresh
man center Alkistis Benekou had
a fantastic day's play, scoring five
against No. 11 San Jose State in
the opening-round match before
adding another two against Stan

ford in the quarterfinal matchup.
The two teams were knotted
throughout and a clear lead was
very difficult to come by before
halftime, as goals from Grossman
and senior two-meter Annika
Dries were immediately pegged
back by ASU junior utility player
Liz Kreek and junior defender
Ao Gao. Stanford's greater pedi
gree began to show in the third
period, as the Cardinal came out
energized after the break and
quickly extended its lead to 11-6,
but this lead only led to a pro
longed period of sloppy play that
allowed the Sun Devils to slowly
cut into the deficit. Two goals in
the final eight seconds made the
game's climax thrilling, but Stan
ford would hold on to win 11-10.
Stanford moved on toward the
semifinals knowing that it would
have to play better in order to get

past No. 3 UCLA, whom it had
defeated 8-4 at the Stanford Invi
tational earlier this season. How
ever, the Card got off to an awful
start and conceded the first three
goals of the matchup. That
marked the first time all season
that Stanford had been down by
more than two goals and put the
Card in an early hole from which
it could never quite recover.
