### â€” Andrew Vogeley 
In partnership with the Biblio
theque nationale de France (BnF),
Stanford recently announced the re
lease of 14,000 high-resolution im
ages and documents through the
new French Revolution Digital
Archive.
The project led on the Stan
ford end by University librarian
Michael Keller, Professor of French
Dan Edelstein and Special Projects
Director John Haeger digitized
images and documents from two
main sources: the "Archives par
lementaires" and the "Images de la
Revolution francaise".
According to the project's web
site, the archive arose out of an "ex
pressed need by scholars of the
French Revolution to gain greater
and more flexible access to their
sources."
The database will allow scholars
to search the images and documents
by theme, while placing the result in
a timeline that shows the context in
which the document or image was
created.
