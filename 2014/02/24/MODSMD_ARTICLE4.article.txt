# Stanford backs off Dish parking plan
## 
### â€” Andrew Vogeley 
Stanford has backed off from its
plan to eliminate some parking spots
near the Dish after experiencing
community backlash against the pro
posed move.
The University had proposed
eliminating 33 parking spots on
Stanford Avenue to clear space for a
new "perimeter trail," with the in
tent to move the spots to the parking
lot on Coyote Hill Road, about a mile
from the Dish gate.
Palo Alto Mayor Nancy Shep
herd submitted a letter on Feb. 13 to
Larry Horton '62 M.A. '66, senior
associate vice president for govern
ment and community relations, ex
pressing concern over the elimina
tion of the parking spots.
In response, Horton said the
University would add back-in angle
parking.
"If both the city and Stanford
jointly support back-in angle park
ing, I believe we will have an excel
lent chance of getting this program
approved by the county," Horton
wrote in a letter to Shepherd.
Horton noted that the revised
plan was not official, as the trail has
to be approved by the Santa Clara
County Board.
