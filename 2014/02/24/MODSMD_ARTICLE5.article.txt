## Sophomore unveils film Switch' Documentary chronicles struggles with Huntington's 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
On Friday evening, Kristen Pow
ers 'l6 held a "sneak peak" screen
ing of her documentary, "Twitch," in
Annenberg Auditorium, in an event
attended by close to 100 people.
The screening of "Twitch,"
which tells the autobiographical sto

ry of Powers' struggles with poten
tially having Huntington's disease
from a very young age, was fol
lowed with a brief panel of experts.
Passed down through family ge
netics, Huntington's is a disorder
that causes the degeneration of
parts of the brain and can lead to a
loss of muscle coordination and cog
nitive decline. Powers combined
short, unedited video clips that she
took of herself in high school to cre
ate a 43-minute film of her moments

of emotion and expression.
When Powers was 9 years old,
her mother, Nicola Jane Powers,
was diagnosed with Huntington's
disease. However, since her moth
er showed signs as early as 1999,
Powers largely does not remember
her mother before the effects of
the disease. Powers related the
discrimination they experienced as
a result of her mother's drastic
mood swings and yelling, which of
ten led people to mock her mother
by calling her a drunk.
When Powers learned that she
had a 50 percent chance of inherit
ing Huntington's, she adamantly
pursued the opportunity to get ge
netically tested, believing that her
life would be less burdensome if
she simply knew the answer.
"I wanted to know sooner
rather than later if I had Hunting
ton's. I would have chosen to be
tested at 16, but could not until I
was 18," Powers said. "The wisdom
of not knowing was a lot heavier
than the wisdom of knowing."
Powers began capturing snip
pets of her life in high school as the
time for the testing came closer.
She even filmed on the anniver
sary of her mother's death. She
said that the documentary had a
specific purpose for her.
"It gave me a lot of control over
my genetic testing experience,"

Powers said. "It was my way of
controlling the uncontrollable. I
couldn't control what test result I
was going to get, but I could con
trol and manage my film crew."
On the other hand, the docu
mentary posed challenges to her
family, especially her father.
"This documentary was some
what hard on my dad especially,
because he has two kids at risk for
HD, so this was making something
that was very abstract for years
suddenly very real," Powers said.
Three panelists neurologist
Rosalind Chuang, genetic coun
selor Carly Siskind and Roy
Nierenberg, a lawyer and founder
of a computer-assisted thinking
software company were avail
able to answer audience questions
after Power's documentary.
Siskind explained that the turn
around between having the blood
test and getting the results had
been unusually short for Powers:
only two weeks. Normally the
waiting period is a month, if not six
weeks, with the intent of making
sure that knowing the result is the
right decision for that patient.
Siskind also discussed the counsel
ing process.
"They come in and take a neu
rological exam and get the whole
counseling spiel, and they learn
about what [Huntington's disease]
is and about genetic discrimination
and reproductive options in the fu
ture," Siskind said. "Then they
come back for the blood draw and
then a month later for the results."
Powers is among the five per

cent of at-risk individuals for
Huntington's who choose to go
through with genetic counseling.
According to Siskin, most individu
als do not want to know if their re
sults come back positive and that
they will suffer from Huntington's.
Powers' best friend, Daniel
Woldorff, was present at the mo
ment when her test result was re
vealed.
"It felt like we were standing on
a bridge that could give out,"
Woldorff said. "Was it going to fall
through? I felt like the world could
be turned upside down right now
or it could stay right side up."
Nierenberg, who was diag
nosed with Huntington's at 63, ex
plained that one can live a happy
life with the disease.
"The way I think of it is that
you're dealt certain cards,"
Nierenberg said. "Play them the
best way you can. I wanted to have
something in my life that I felt
passionate about. I joined the
Berkeley Community Chorus and
ride my bicycle up and down the
hill every day, and I try to have a
couple of things that I just love."
Powers is currently creating an
educational packet that will be dis
tributed along with the movie and
is in the process of raising $5,000
more for further development of
her documentary.

couldn't control what test result I
was going to get, but I could con
trol and manage my film crew."
On the other hand, the docu
mentary posed challenges to her
family, especially her father.
"This documentary was some
what hard on my dad especially,
because he has two kids at risk for
HD, so this was making something
that was very abstract for years
suddenly very real," Powers said.
Three panelists neurologist
Rosalind Chuang, genetic coun
selor Carly Siskind and Roy
Nierenberg, a lawyer and founder
of a computer-assisted thinking
software company were avail
able to answer audience questions
after Power's documentary.
Siskind explained that the turn
around between having the blood
test and getting the results had
been unusually short for Powers:
only two weeks. Normally the
waiting period is a month, if not six
weeks, with the intent of making
sure that knowing the result is the
right decision for that patient.
Siskind also discussed the counsel
ing process.
"They come in and take a neu
rological exam and get the whole
counseling spiel, and they learn
about what [Huntington's disease]
is and about genetic discrimination
and reproductive options in the fu
ture," Siskind said. "Then they
come back for the blood draw and
then a month later for the results."
Powers is among the five per

cent of at-risk individuals for
Huntington's who choose to go
through with genetic counseling.
According to Siskin, most individu
als do not want to know if their re
sults come back positive and that
they will suffer from Huntington's.
Powers' best friend, Daniel
Woldorff, was present at the mo
ment when her test result was re
vealed.
"It felt like we were standing on
a bridge that could give out,"
Woldorff said. "Was it going to fall
through? I felt like the world could
be turned upside down right now
or it could stay right side up."
Nierenberg, who was diag
nosed with Huntington's at 63, ex
plained that one can live a happy
life with the disease.
"The way I think of it is that
you're dealt certain cards,"
Nierenberg said. "Play them the
best way you can. I wanted to have
something in my life that I felt
passionate about. I joined the
Berkeley Community Chorus and
ride my bicycle up and down the
hill every day, and I try to have a
couple of things that I just love."
Powers is currently creating an
educational packet that will be dis
tributed along with the movie and
is in the process of raising $5,000
more for further development of
her documentary.

On Friday evening, Kristen Pow
ers 'l6 held a "sneak peak" screen
ing of her documentary, "Twitch," in
Annenberg Auditorium, in an event
attended by close to 100 people.
The screening of "Twitch,"
which tells the autobiographical sto

ry of Powers' struggles with poten
tially having Huntington's disease
from a very young age, was fol
lowed with a brief panel of experts.
Passed down through family ge
netics, Huntington's is a disorder
that causes the degeneration of
parts of the brain and can lead to a
loss of muscle coordination and cog
nitive decline. Powers combined
short, unedited video clips that she
took of herself in high school to cre
ate a 43-minute film of her moments

of emotion and expression.
When Powers was 9 years old,
her mother, Nicola Jane Powers,
was diagnosed with Huntington's
disease. However, since her moth
er showed signs as early as 1999,
Powers largely does not remember
her mother before the effects of
the disease. Powers related the
discrimination they experienced as
a result of her mother's drastic
mood swings and yelling, which of
ten led people to mock her mother
by calling her a drunk.
When Powers learned that she
had a 50 percent chance of inherit
ing Huntington's, she adamantly
pursued the opportunity to get ge
netically tested, believing that her
life would be less burdensome if
she simply knew the answer.
"I wanted to know sooner
rather than later if I had Hunting
ton's. I would have chosen to be
tested at 16, but could not until I
was 18," Powers said. "The wisdom
of not knowing was a lot heavier
than the wisdom of knowing."
Powers began capturing snip
pets of her life in high school as the
time for the testing came closer.
She even filmed on the anniver
sary of her mother's death. She
said that the documentary had a
specific purpose for her.
"It gave me a lot of control over
my genetic testing experience,"

Powers said. "It was my way of
controlling the uncontrollable. I
couldn't control what test result I
was going to get, but I could con
trol and manage my film crew."
On the other hand, the docu

family, especially her father.
