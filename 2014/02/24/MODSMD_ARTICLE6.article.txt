## Faculty Senate approves Joint Majors program 
### KYLIE JUE DESK EDITOR 
The Faculty Senate discussed changes to
course evaluations and also approved a template
for a new Joint Majors Program at its meeting
last Thursday.
Russell Berman, chair of the Course Evalua
tion Committee, presented a proposal for a new
form that would reduce the number of discrete
items on the course evaluation questionnaire
from 34 to 17. To reduce repetitiveness, the form
would also automatically fill in data such as ma
jor and class year.
In addition to addressing students' irritation
with course evaluations' length and repetitive
ness, the new form would also focus on customiz
ability through a pre-questionnaire for instruc
tors about which course components should be
evaluated.
As part of an effort to foster the creation of a
culture of teaching and learning, the form will al
so indicate specific course learning goals. The
