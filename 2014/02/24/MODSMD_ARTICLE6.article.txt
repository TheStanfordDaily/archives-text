## Faculty Senate approves Joint Majors program 
### KYLIE JUE DESK EDITOR 
The Faculty Senate discussed changes to
course evaluations and also approved a template
for a new Joint Majors Program at its meeting
last Thursday.
Russell Berman, chair of the Course Evalua
tion Committee, presented a proposal for a new
form that would reduce the number of discrete
items on the course evaluation questionnaire
from 34 to 17. To reduce repetitiveness, the form
would also automatically fill in data such as ma
jor and class year.
In addition to addressing students' irritation
with course evaluations' length and repetitive
ness, the new form would also focus on customiz
ability through a pre-questionnaire for instruc
tors about which course components should be
evaluated.
As part of an effort to foster the creation of a
culture of teaching and learning, the form will al
so indicate specific course learning goals. The

another student to know

about this class?" and - to
ensure that students an
swered evaluations thought
fully - suggested that in
structors give students fif
teen minutes during the last
week of class to work on the
form.

The second half of the
meeting began with the
presentation of a new Joint

Majors Program proposal,
which would integrate the
studies of two different de
partments. The pilot pro
gram for the Joint Majors
Program, which will initially
feature collaborations be
tween humanities depart
ments and computer science
(CS), has also been referred
to as the CS+X Initiative.

The Joint Majors Pro
gram will reduce the num
ber of units required for the
combination of the two ma
jors and will also feature a
capstone experience inte
grating the fields of study,
according to the presenta
tion.

According to Nicholas
Jenkins, director of the CS-
X Initiative for the Office of
the Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education
(VPUE), the idea for the
Joint Majors Program origi

ence department last year

veyed introductory level CS
classes and found a strong
interest in combining CS
with other disciplines.
"What we wanted to do
for students was give them
an academic structure
where they can think about
their two academic passions
and merge them together,"
Jenkins told The Daily after
the meeting.
The Senate approved a
six-year pilot period for the
program by a unanimous
voice vote.
While joint majors may
eventually span several dif
ferent departments, in addi
tion to computer science and
the humanities, initial pro
posals for joint majors in
CS/Music and CS/English
will be voted on during the
next Senate meeting on Mar.
6. If the Senate passes the
proposal, those two joint ma
jors will be offered starting
next academic year.
