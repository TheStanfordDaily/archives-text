# Stanford in NYC plan submitted
## Bloomberg. faculty note challenges to viability 
### DOMINICA WAMBOLD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Plans for a Stanford program in New
York City have continued to take shape in
recent weeks, punctuated by the Univer
sity's submission of a 115-page proposal
to the New York State Board of Educa
tion.
According to Sharon Palmer '9O, asso
ciate vice provost of undergraduate edu
cation, the quarter-long Stanford in New
York City program will be modeled after
the popular Bing Stanford in Washington
program. Rather than focusing on poli
tics and policy, however, the New York
City program will emphasize the arts, ar
chitecture, design and urban studies.
"It will involve students in full-time in
ternships, and they'll also be taking class
es in those fields, so they'll have that
same kind of experiential model as Stan
ford in Washington," Palmer said.
John Barton, director of the Universi
ty's architecture program and a member
of the proposal's faculty advisory com
mittee, framed access to New York City's
unique environment as well worth the ad
ministrative effort of establishing such a
program.
"The opportunity to go to New York
and work in city planning as an architec
ture major, or in a gallery as a painter, or
in a theater as a theater major, and then
have the coursework as well, would be a
really powerful experience for students,"
Barton said.
Palmer echoed Barton's sentiments,
adding that being in New York City
would allow Stanford students to take ad
vantage of experiences that aren't of
fered on campus.
"New York provides unparalleled cul
tural and art resources and opportunities
for internships and activities in these
fields that really aren't available the
same way on the Stanford campus," she
said.
Challenges moving forward
However, the proposal continues to
face concerns about its viability and po
tential impact. Former New York City
mayor Michael Bloomberg, who super
vised the competition for an applied sci
ences and engineering campus in New
York City for which Stanford initially bid
before withdrawing, questioned the value
of the proposed program to the broader
city.
"You've got to understand how big the
arts are in New York," Bloomberg said.
"It's hard to argue that another school
that wanted to have students visit muse
ums and take a course here and there
would have any measurable impact
on New York. I think the only ques
tion you could have is whether it
would be good for Stanford stu
dents."
Meanwhile, Barton acknowl
edged the challenges presented by
finding students fulfilling intern
ships in the New York art scene.
"Typically, these positions don't
pay, but students also don't get
credit for them," Barton said, not
ing that such arrangements may
breach codes of ethics in fields like
architecture. "So we're trying to
find away to get students either
pay or credit."
Bloomberg argued that locating
the program in New York City
might actually pose disadvantages
for students due to the city's popu
larity.
"I do think that you might be
able to do the same thing else
where, and you might make the
case that [students] might be better
off in small towns, or even small
cities with small arts resources, just
because they'd be more important
and more valuable there,"
Bloomberg said. "In New York,
they may well get lost among all the
kids who want to work in this city."
Barton expressed confidence,
however, that Stanford would be
able to identify internships of the
quality expected by students.
"I think it's going to take a little
bit of time, and it's going to take
some development of assets," Bar
ton said. "We're going to find people
who are interested and then really
become partners over time,
whether they be galleries or theater
programs or museums."
Barton cited other challenges
including integrating disciplinary
diversity into the students' experi
ence in New York, identifying hous
ing for students and dealing with
New York state laws that regulate
school openings within the state
as being more pertinent.
"We're still struggling with the
balance between the coursework
time, the internship time, and the
time [students] are spending most

ly with people of similar disciplines
and how much time they have to

spend together across disciplines,"
Barton explained.
Barton framed the challenge of
ensuring disciplinary diversity as
more accentuated than at Stanford
in Washington, which he described
as offering more naturally cross

disciplinary internships and course
work.

While administrators empha
sized the value of the proposed pro
gram in terms of expanding the op
portunities available to students,
Bloomberg described the benefits of
the initiative as much more limited
than those that would have been of

fered by the comprehensive campus
Stanford had previously sought.
"I thought Stanford made a mis
take in the engineering situation
because it could have been a branch
for Stanford that would be substan
tive and would give their faculty in

[Silicon Valley] a chance to go back
and forth," Bloomberg said. "The

engineering school was sending
students here for three years. It
brought a lot of great faculty, it was
great for New York City and I
think it would have been great for
Stanford."

York City program will be modeled after
the popular Bing Stanford in Washington
program. Rather than focusing on poli
tics and policy, however, the New York
City program will emphasize the arts, ar
chitecture, design and urban studies.
"It will involve students in full-time in
ternships, and they'll also be taking class
es in those fields, so they'll have that
same kind of experiential model as Stan
ford in Washington," Palmer said.
John Barton, director of the Universi
ty's architecture program and a member
of the proposal's faculty advisory com
mittee, framed access to New York City's
unique environment as well worth the ad
ministrative effort of establishing such a
program.
"The opportunity to go to New York
and work in city planning as an architec
ture major, or in a gallery as a painter, or
in a theater as a theater major, and then
have the coursework as well, would be a
really powerful experience for students,"
Barton said.
Palmer echoed Barton's sentiments,
adding that being in New York City
would allow Stanford students to take ad
vantage of experiences that aren't of
fered on campus.
"New York provides unparalleled cul
tural and art resources and opportunities
for internships and activities in these
fields that really aren't available the
same way on the Stanford campus," she
said.
Challenges moving forward
However, the proposal continues to
face concerns about its viability and po
tential impact. Former New York City
mayor Michael Bloomberg, who super
vised the competition for an applied sci
ences and engineering campus in New
York City for which Stanford initially bid
before withdrawing, questioned the value
of the proposed program to the broader
city.
"You've got to understand how big the
arts are in New York," Bloomberg said.
"It's hard to argue that another school
that wanted to have students visit muse
ums and take a course here and there
would have any measurable impact
on New York. I think the only ques
tion you could have is whether it
would be good for Stanford stu
dents."
Meanwhile, Barton acknowl
edged the challenges presented by
finding students fulfilling intern
ships in the New York art scene.
"Typically, these positions don't
pay, but students also don't get
credit for them," Barton said, not
ing that such arrangements may
breach codes of ethics in fields like
architecture. "So we're trying to
find away to get students either
pay or credit."
Bloomberg argued that locating
the program in New York City
might actually pose disadvantages
for students due to the city's popu
larity.
"I do think that you might be
able to do the same thing else
where, and you might make the
case that [students] might be better
off in small towns, or even small
cities with small arts resources, just
because they'd be more important
and more valuable there,"
Bloomberg said. "In New York,
they may well get lost among all the
kids who want to work in this city."
Barton expressed confidence,
however, that Stanford would be
able to identify internships of the
quality expected by students.
"I think it's going to take a little
bit of time, and it's going to take
some development of assets," Bar
ton said. "We're going to find people
who are interested and then really
become partners over time,
whether they be galleries or theater
programs or museums."
Barton cited other challenges
including integrating disciplinary
diversity into the students' experi
ence in New York, identifying hous
ing for students and dealing with
New York state laws that regulate
school openings within the state
as being more pertinent.
"We're still struggling with the
balance between the coursework
time, the internship time, and the
time [students] are spending most

ly with people of similar disciplines
and how much time they have to

spend together across disciplines,"
Barton explained.
Barton framed the challenge of
ensuring disciplinary diversity as
more accentuated than at Stanford
in Washington, which he described
as offering more naturally cross

disciplinary internships and course
work.

While administrators empha
sized the value of the proposed pro
gram in terms of expanding the op
portunities available to students,
Bloomberg described the benefits of
the initiative as much more limited
than those that would have been of

fered by the comprehensive campus
Stanford had previously sought.
"I thought Stanford made a mis
take in the engineering situation
because it could have been a branch
for Stanford that would be substan
tive and would give their faculty in

[Silicon Valley] a chance to go back
and forth," Bloomberg said. "The

engineering school was sending
students here for three years. It
brought a lot of great faculty, it was
great for New York City and I
think it would have been great for
Stanford."

Plans for a Stanford program in New
York City have continued to take shape in
recent weeks, punctuated by the Univer
sity's submission of a 115-page proposal
to the New York State Board of Educa
tion.
