# Stanford in NYC plan submitted
## Bloomberg. faculty note challenges to viability 
### DOMINICA WAMBOLD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Plans for a Stanford program in New
York City have continued to take shape in
recent weeks, punctuated by the Univer
sity's submission of a 115-page proposal
to the New York State Board of Educa
tion.
According to Sharon Palmer '9O, asso
ciate vice provost of undergraduate edu
cation, the quarter-long Stanford in New
York City program will be modeled after
the popular Bing Stanford in Washington
program. Rather than focusing on poli
tics and policy, however, the New York
City program will emphasize the arts, ar
chitecture, design and urban studies.
"It will involve students in full-time in
ternships, and they'll also be taking class
es in those fields, so they'll have that
same kind of experiential model as Stan
ford in Washington," Palmer said.
John Barton, director of the Universi
ty's architecture program and a member
of the proposal's faculty advisory com
mittee, framed access to New York City's
unique environment as well worth the ad
ministrative effort of establishing such a
program.
"The opportunity to go to New York
and work in city planning as an architec
ture major, or in a gallery as a painter, or
in a theater as a theater major, and then
have the coursework as well, would be a
really powerful experience for students,"
Barton said.
Palmer echoed Barton's sentiments,
adding that being in New York City
would allow Stanford students to take ad
vantage of experiences that aren't of
fered on campus.
"New York provides unparalleled cul
tural and art resources and opportunities
for internships and activities in these
fields that really aren't available the
same way on the Stanford campus," she
said.
Challenges moving forward
However, the proposal continues to
face concerns about its viability and po
tential impact. Former New York City
mayor Michael Bloomberg, who super
vised the competition for an applied sci
ences and engineering campus in New
York City for which Stanford initially bid
before withdrawing, questioned the value
of the proposed program to the broader
city.
"You've got to understand how big the
arts are in New York," Bloomberg said.
"It's hard to argue that another school
that wanted to have students visit muse
ums and take a course here and there
