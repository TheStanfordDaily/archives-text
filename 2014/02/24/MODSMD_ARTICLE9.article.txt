## In Venezuela, Ideology and its Consequences 
### James Bradbury 
There is something starkly im
pressive in the Venezuelan
government's accomplish
ment, in the ideological construction
of an alternate universe so thor
oughly divorced from reality and yet
so thoroughly integrated into the
political fabric of the country.
The Venezuelan economy is not
on the brink of collapse because of
covert "economic warfare" carried
out by a shadowy "oligarchy," as the
government's alternate universe
would have it, but because of spec
tacular financial mismanagement,
corruption and a stridently antago
nistic approach to private industry
and international trade.
The Venezuelan political opposi
tion is not "ultrarightist," and cer
tainly not "fascist" indeed, the
scrupulously moderate former pres
idential candidate Henrique
Capriles is the grandson of Holo
caust survivors and opposition
leader Leopoldo Lopez is not a CIA
agent just because he attended an
American graduate school.
Student anti-government
protests that began several weeks
ago and escalated on Feb. 12 are not
"fascist violence," and the few re
maining independent media outlets
that dare to cover them are neither
"inciting hatred" nor "advocating a
coup."
But what Colombia's NTN
the only television channel broad
casting the protests live and was re
warded for its courage by being
blocked from all Venezuelan televi
sions— and the thousands who
have taken to social media with their
stories and pictures are doing is
telling the truth. And in a Venezuela
with constant and debilitating short
ages of everything from toilet paper
to newsprint, the truth may be the
scarcest commodity of all.
Current Venezuelan President
Nicolas Maduro took over after the
death of his mentor Hugo Chavez
last year. Between them, the United
Socialist Party has controlled the
country for 15 years, slowly ratchet
ing up the state monopoly on goods
and information. (Globovision, the
last independent TV station based in
the country whose existence gave
many Venezuelans hope that the
truth would not be smothered com
pletely— was forced into submis
sion a few months ago.)
Indeed, 15 years is long enough
that opposition to Chavez and
Maduro's self-styled "Bolivarian"
regime has undergone a full genera
tional cycle and veterans of the
2002 protest movement that came
nearest to ousting Chavez say that
the students now protesting in the
streets of Caracas have yet to learn
the lessons of that earlier attempt.
The criticisms leveled against
the new generation of protesters by
the older generation are often harsh
and can easily sound bitter. "The
one thing Chavismo can't do with
out is an enemy" is point one of a list
of "seven lessons today's students
are eventually going to figure out,"
and "you are the perfect enemy: se
riously, you tick all the boxes" is
point two.
For the generation that learned

from the failure of the 2002 protests
that revolution should be pursued
moderately, slowly and constitution
ally— above all, through the suc
cessive presidential bids of Hen
rique Capriles, who lost last year's
election by only 1.5 percent the
very fact that the economic crisis on
whose brink Venezuela has stood for
years has now palpably arrived
means that now is not the time for
protests. The government is looking
for scapegoats more urgently than
ever and, had these scapegoats not
been forthcoming, it might have
been forced over the next few
months to accept an even greater
share of blame for the economic dis
aster.
But asking young people who
share your indignation at Bolivarian
dictatorship and your vision for a
better Venezuela not to take to the
streets and say so is still a little pre
sumptuous, even if you justifiably
believe that protesting now is coun
terproductive. Today's students
have known nothing but Chavista
government and heard nothing of
protest for nearly 12 years, but even
though they are told that "now is not
the time," they refuse to wait for a
third Capriles candidacy in 2018
that, they're assured, will finally be
the one that makes it.
With last Wednesday's deaths of
two student protesters (almost cer
tainly at the hands of plainclothes
government militia groups known
as colectivos, and followed by
three more in recent days) and
credible reports of indescribably
brutal police torture of those who
were merely arrested, the time has
passed for second-guessing. The
government still has a monopoly on
the airwaves, the store shelves and
the foreign exchange markets, but
they have lost exclusive claim to the
title of martyr.
I harbor few illusions that the
present protests will bring about the
collapse of the regime of media disin
formation that blankets Venezuela
with lies, let alone the government of
Nicolas Madui'o and his battle-hard
ened Bolivarian coalition.
But on Tbesday when Leopoldo
Lopez the unflappable opposition
leader and Capriles rival who has
thrown in his lot with the students
stood up on a statue of Jose
Marti, addressed the crowd and
turned himself in to waiting Nation
al Guard troops, I knew his vision of
a "free and democratic Venezuela"
was within reach.
And it is worth remembering, as
Lopez said on Hiesday, that "the
Venezuelan people are suffering
long lines and shortages and young
people have no jobs and no future"
not by any fault of their own, and not
only as a result of government in
competence, but " por un modelo
equivocado" —because of a bro
ken and misguided economic model
"imported from abroad." The global
left may not be paying attention
but in Venezuela, its ideology has
once again built a teetering mon
strosity.

ally— above all, through the suc
cessive presidential bids of Hen
rique Capriles, who lost last year's
election by only 1.5 percent the
very fact that the economic crisis on
whose brink Venezuela has stood for
years has now palpably arrived
means that now is not the time for
protests. The government is looking
for scapegoats more urgently than
ever and, had these scapegoats not
been forthcoming, it might have
been forced over the next few
months to accept an even greater
share of blame for the economic dis
aster.
But asking young people who
share your indignation at Bolivarian
dictatorship and your vision for a
better Venezuela not to take to the
streets and say so is still a little pre
sumptuous, even if you justifiably
believe that protesting now is coun
terproductive. Today's students
have known nothing but Chavista
government and heard nothing of
protest for nearly 12 years, but even
though they are told that "now is not
the time," they refuse to wait for a
third Capriles candidacy in 2018
that, they're assured, will finally be
the one that makes it.
With last Wednesday's deaths of
two student protesters (almost cer
tainly at the hands of plainclothes
government militia groups known
as colectivos, and followed by
three more in recent days) and
credible reports of indescribably
brutal police torture of those who
were merely arrested, the time has
passed for second-guessing. The
government still has a monopoly on
the airwaves, the store shelves and
the foreign exchange markets, but
they have lost exclusive claim to the
title of martyr.
I harbor few illusions that the
present protests will bring about the
collapse of the regime of media disin
formation that blankets Venezuela
with lies, let alone the government of
Nicolas Madui'o and his battle-hard
ened Bolivarian coalition.
But on Tbesday when Leopoldo
Lopez the unflappable opposition
leader and Capriles rival who has
thrown in his lot with the students
stood up on a statue of Jose
Marti, addressed the crowd and
turned himself in to waiting Nation
al Guard troops, I knew his vision of
a "free and democratic Venezuela"
was within reach.
And it is worth remembering, as
Lopez said on Hiesday, that "the
Venezuelan people are suffering
long lines and shortages and young
people have no jobs and no future"
not by any fault of their own, and not
only as a result of government in
competence, but " por un modelo
equivocado" —because of a bro
ken and misguided economic model
"imported from abroad." The global
left may not be paying attention
but in Venezuela, its ideology has
once again built a teetering mon
strosity.

There is something starkly im
pressive in the Venezuelan
government's accomplish
ment, in the ideological construction
of an alternate universe so thor
oughly divorced from reality and yet
so thoroughly integrated into the
political fabric of the country.
The Venezuelan economy is not
on the brink of collapse because of
covert "economic warfare" carried
out by a shadowy "oligarchy," as the
government's alternate universe
would have it, but because of spec
tacular financial mismanagement,
corruption and a stridently antago
nistic approach to private industry
and international trade.
The Venezuelan political opposi
tion is not "ultrarightist," and cer
tainly not "fascist" indeed, the
scrupulously moderate former pres
idential candidate Henrique
Capriles is the grandson of Holo
caust survivors and opposition
leader Leopoldo Lopez is not a CIA
agent just because he attended an
American graduate school.
Student anti-government
protests that began several weeks
ago and escalated on Feb. 12 are not
"fascist violence," and the few re
maining independent media outlets
that dare to cover them are neither
"inciting hatred" nor "advocating a
coup."
But what Colombia's NTN
the only television channel broad
casting the protests live and was re
warded for its courage by being
blocked from all Venezuelan televi
sions— and the thousands who
have taken to social media with their
stories and pictures are doing is
telling the truth. And in a Venezuela
with constant and debilitating short
ages of everything from toilet paper
to newsprint, the truth may be the
scarcest commodity of all.
Current Venezuelan President
Nicolas Maduro took over after the
death of his mentor Hugo Chavez
last year. Between them, the United
Socialist Party has controlled the
country for 15 years, slowly ratchet
ing up the state monopoly on goods
and information. (Globovision, the
last independent TV station based in
the country whose existence gave
many Venezuelans hope that the
truth would not be smothered com
pletely— was forced into submis
sion a few months ago.)
Indeed, 15 years is long enough
that opposition to Chavez and
Maduro's self-styled "Bolivarian"
regime has undergone a full genera
tional cycle and veterans of the
2002 protest movement that came
nearest to ousting Chavez say that
the students now protesting in the
streets of Caracas have yet to learn
the lessons of that earlier attempt.
The criticisms leveled against
the new generation of protesters by
the older generation are often harsh
and can easily sound bitter. "The
one thing Chavismo can't do with
out is an enemy" is point one of a list
of "seven lessons today's students
are eventually going to figure out,"
and "you are the perfect enemy: se
riously, you tick all the boxes" is
point two.
For the generation that learned

from the failure of the 2002 protests
that revolution should be pursued
moderately, slowly and constitution
ally— above all, through the suc
cessive presidential bids of Hen
rique Capriles, who lost last year's
election by only 1.5 percent the
