# SPRING REVIVAL
## 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Stanford football officially
kicked off its spring practices on
Monday afternoon with several fa
miliar faces at new positions on the
field. Sophomores Kodi Whitfield
and Dallas Lloyd both began their

transitions from wide receiver and
quarterback, respectively, to free
safety.
"I gave Kodi the option a
chance to compete for the starting
spot at free safety or stay in the
competition at receiver and still

play," said head coach David Shaw.
"It was not a decision made by me,
it was made by Kodi."
Whitfield makes the move from
wide receiver to free safety after
breaking through at wide receiver
in his sophomore season with 16
catches for 170 yards, including an
incredible one-handed touchdown

catch against UCLA.
"Given that we're losing a cou
ple of guys â€”Ed Reynolds, who
was a big part of our defense
Coach Shaw pointed out that I had
a good chance to come in and con
tribute right away on defense,"
Whitfield said. "I jumped on it. It
wasn't motivated at all by offense,
it was just the best circumstance
for me. With my safety background
in high school I feel comfortable
back there already."
In addition, Lloyd transitions to
safety after serving as the Cardi
nal's option quarterback this past
season. He recorded six carries for
26 yards as a sophomore.
"Both [Whitfield and Lloyd]
have some natural ability back
there," Shaw said. "My dad who
has been watching this longer than
I've been alive five minutes into
practice said those two guys look
natural. I trust his eyes as much as
anybody on this planet."
The safety position remains va
cant in the wake of senior Ed
Reynolds' departure. Reynolds
shined as a safety with Cardinal,
leading the team with six intercep
tions and finishing one yard shy of
the NCAA's interception return
yards record in 2012. The spot will
presumably be up for grabs in
spring and summer practices with
Whitfield and Lloyd leading the
competition.
The defense this season will
train under new defensive coordi
nator Lance Anderson and new
inside linebackers coach Pete
