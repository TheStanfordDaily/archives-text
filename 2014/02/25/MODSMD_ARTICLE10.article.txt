# SPRING REVIVAL
## 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Stanford football officially
kicked off its spring practices on
Monday afternoon with several fa
miliar faces at new positions on the
field. Sophomores Kodi Whitfield
and Dallas Lloyd both began their

transitions from wide receiver and
quarterback, respectively, to free
safety.
"I gave Kodi the option a
chance to compete for the starting
spot at free safety or stay in the
competition at receiver and still

play," said head coach David Shaw.
"It was not a decision made by me,
it was made by Kodi."
Whitfield makes the move from
wide receiver to free safety after
breaking through at wide receiver
in his sophomore season with 16
catches for 170 yards, including an
incredible one-handed touchdown

catch against UCLA.
"Given that we're losing a cou
ple of guys —Ed Reynolds, who
was a big part of our defense
Coach Shaw pointed out that I had
a good chance to come in and con
tribute right away on defense,"
Whitfield said. "I jumped on it. It
wasn't motivated at all by offense,
it was just the best circumstance
for me. With my safety background
in high school I feel comfortable
back there already."
In addition, Lloyd transitions to
safety after serving as the Cardi
nal's option quarterback this past
season. He recorded six carries for
26 yards as a sophomore.
"Both [Whitfield and Lloyd]
have some natural ability back
there," Shaw said. "My dad who
has been watching this longer than
I've been alive five minutes into
practice said those two guys look
natural. I trust his eyes as much as
anybody on this planet."
The safety position remains va
cant in the wake of senior Ed
Reynolds' departure. Reynolds
shined as a safety with Cardinal,
leading the team with six intercep
tions and finishing one yard shy of
the NCAA's interception return
yards record in 2012. The spot will
presumably be up for grabs in
spring and summer practices with
Whitfield and Lloyd leading the
competition.
The defense this season will
train under new defensive coordi
nator Lance Anderson and new
inside linebackers coach Pete

Junior inside linebacker Blake Martinez (left) will look to play a major role in replacing departed fifth-year
senior linebacker Shayne Skov for a Cardinal defense that has several new faces joining from the offense.
Hansen. Anderson and
Hansen took over after for
mer defensive coordinator
Derek Mason and former in
side linebackers coach
David Kotulski left for Van
derbilt. Another opening on
the defensive staff remains
for a secondary coach that
will likely be filled in the
next week, according to
Shaw.
"Coach Anderson has
been here and he knows how
Coach Mason ran the show
before," said junior inside
linebacker Blake Martinez.
"It's kind of the same. We
made a survey to see what
we liked and didn't like be
forehand to see what we
wanted to keep [from Ma
son's tenure]."
Martinez figures to be a
leading candidate to replace
departing fifth-year senior
Shayne Skov at inside line
backer in 2014. Martinez fin

ished with eleven total tack
les in ten games played last
season.
On the other side of the
ball, the offensive line faces
the difficult task of replac
ing four former starters.
Sophomore left tackle An
drus Peat is the only return
ing starter from last season.
However, several of the po
tential starters for next sea
son like sophomores Kyle
Murphy and Josh Garnett
have already seen play
ing time as jumbo tight ends
or "ogre" backs in Stanford's
"heavy" package.
"You're looking at Kyle
Murphy, quote unquote, be
ing a first time starter,"
Shaw said. "Murphy's
played a lot of football the
last two years. Josh Garnett
played a lot of football last
year. We have a lot of guys
who have played a lot of foot
ball that are stepping into
these starting roles."
"We've played as many
players as anybody the last
three years. When you play
a lot of guys and the older
guys graduate, their back-

Ups have a lot of experience."
The Cardinal certainly
will not be lacking for expe
rience at the wide receiver
position. Even after Whit
field's change of position,
Stanford still boasts an ex
ceptionally deep wide receiv
er corps with senior Jeff Tro
jan, juniors Ty Montgomery,
Jordan Pratt and Devon Ca
juste, sophomore Michael
Rector and freshman Fran
cis Owusu returning to form
a talented unit.
"I'm excited about our
receiving corps," Shaw
shared. "I don't know if
there's a deeper one in the
nation right now."
Montgomery will miss
the first half of spring prac
tice with a knee injury, as
will senior defensive tackle
David Parry, who is battling
an injury to his midsection.
Sophomore quarterback
Ryan Burns will also miss
the first half of spring prac
tice for disciplinary rea
sons.

Whitfield said. "I jumped on it. It
wasn't motivated at all by offense,
it was just the best circumstance
for me. With my safety background
in high school I feel comfortable
back there already."
In addition, Lloyd transitions to
safety after serving as the Cardi
nal's option quarterback this past
season. He recorded six carries for
26 yards as a sophomore.
"Both [Whitfield and Lloyd]
have some natural ability back
there," Shaw said. "My dad who
has been watching this longer than
I've been alive five minutes into
practice said those two guys look
natural. I trust his eyes as much as
anybody on this planet."
The safety position remains va
cant in the wake of senior Ed
Reynolds' departure. Reynolds
shined as a safety with Cardinal,
leading the team with six intercep
tions and finishing one yard shy of
the NCAA's interception return
yards record in 2012. The spot will
presumably be up for grabs in
spring and summer practices with
Whitfield and Lloyd leading the
competition.
The defense this season will
train under new defensive coordi
nator Lance Anderson and new
inside linebackers coach Pete

Junior inside linebacker Blake Martinez (left) will look to play a major role in replacing departed fifth-year
senior linebacker Shayne Skov for a Cardinal defense that has several new faces joining from the offense.
Hansen. Anderson and
Hansen took over after for
mer defensive coordinator
Derek Mason and former in
side linebackers coach
David Kotulski left for Van
derbilt. Another opening on
the defensive staff remains
for a secondary coach that
will likely be filled in the
next week, according to
Shaw.
"Coach Anderson has
been here and he knows how
Coach Mason ran the show
before," said junior inside
linebacker Blake Martinez.
"It's kind of the same. We
made a survey to see what
we liked and didn't like be
forehand to see what we
wanted to keep [from Ma
son's tenure]."
Martinez figures to be a
leading candidate to replace
departing fifth-year senior
Shayne Skov at inside line
backer in 2014. Martinez fin

ished with eleven total tack
les in ten games played last
season.
On the other side of the
ball, the offensive line faces
the difficult task of replac
ing four former starters.
Sophomore left tackle An
drus Peat is the only return
ing starter from last season.
However, several of the po
tential starters for next sea
son like sophomores Kyle
Murphy and Josh Garnett
have already seen play
ing time as jumbo tight ends
or "ogre" backs in Stanford's
"heavy" package.
"You're looking at Kyle
Murphy, quote unquote, be
ing a first time starter,"
Shaw said. "Murphy's
played a lot of football the
last two years. Josh Garnett
played a lot of football last
year. We have a lot of guys
who have played a lot of foot
ball that are stepping into
these starting roles."
"We've played as many
players as anybody the last
three years. When you play
a lot of guys and the older
guys graduate, their back-

Ups have a lot of experience."
The Cardinal certainly
will not be lacking for expe
rience at the wide receiver
position. Even after Whit
field's change of position,
Stanford still boasts an ex
ceptionally deep wide receiv
er corps with senior Jeff Tro
jan, juniors Ty Montgomery,
Jordan Pratt and Devon Ca
juste, sophomore Michael
Rector and freshman Fran
cis Owusu returning to form
a talented unit.
"I'm excited about our
receiving corps," Shaw
shared. "I don't know if
there's a deeper one in the
nation right now."
Montgomery will miss
the first half of spring prac
tice with a knee injury, as
will senior defensive tackle
David Parry, who is battling
an injury to his midsection.
Sophomore quarterback
Ryan Burns will also miss
the first half of spring prac
tice for disciplinary rea
sons.

Stanford football officially
kicked off its spring practices on
Monday afternoon with several fa
miliar faces at new positions on the
field. Sophomores Kodi Whitfield
and Dallas Lloyd both began their

transitions from wide receiver and
quarterback, respectively, to free
safety.
"I gave Kodi the option a
chance to compete for the starting
spot at free safety or stay in the
competition at receiver and still

play," said head coach David Shaw.
"It was not a decision made by me,
it was made by Kodi."
Whitfield makes the move from
wide receiver to free safety after
breaking through at wide receiver
in his sophomore season with 16
catches for 170 yards, including an
incredible one-handed touchdown

catch against UCLA.
"Given that we're losing a cou
ple of guys —Ed Reynolds, who
was a big part of our defense
Coach Shaw pointed out that I had
a good chance to come in and con
tribute right away on defense,"
Whitfield said. "I jumped on it. It
wasn't motivated at all by offense,
it was just the best circumstance
for me. With my safety background
in high school I feel comfortable
back there already."
