## Monday loss spoils Friday win Late rally falls just short against UCLA 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 8 Stanford men's volley
ball team hosted two top-five oppo
nents over the weekend, facing then-
No. 5 UC-Santa Barbara on Friday
and No. 3 UCLA on Monday. Stanford
went 1-1 for the two matches, sweep
ing UCSB but losing to UCLA in five
brutally close sets.
The Cardinal played impressive
volleyball, with consistent defense and
aggressive offense, and looked deter
mined throughout both games to stop
the cycle of wins and losses it has been
in all season. While Stanford ended
with a loss against UCLA, the match
was so close that if the last two points
had gone the other way, Stanford
would have left Maples Monday with a
win. Stanford is now 9-6 overall and 6-
6 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration.
Against No. 5 UCSB, Stanford
came out strong and steady, sweeping
the Gauchos 25-17,25-18,25-17. It was
Stanford's defense that was truly in
credible and the defining factor in the
win. Stanford limited the Gauchos to a
.011 hitting percentage for the match,
the second-lowest percentage record
ed by an opponent in Stanford's histo
ry. Stanford had an impressive block
ing night with an all-time record of
21.5 blocks and three players record
ing more than seven blocks for the
match.
Furthermore, the normally strong
UCSB offense recorded more errors
than kills for the night, with 11 errors
and only 10 kills. The Cardinal also
held UCSB to zero aces for the night,
which was critical to the Cardinal win
because UCSB's service game is nor
mally a strong advantage and a
weapon.
Senior opposite Eric Mochalski led
the Cardinal with 13 kills and had on
ly one error for the whole match. He
hit .667 while Stanford hit a consistent
.373 overall. Mochalski earned MPSF
Conference Player of the Week hon
ors for his performance against
UCSB. He had a season-high seven
digs and five blocks to go along with
his .667 hitting percentage. Sopho
more middle Conrad Kaminski led the
Cardinal in its blocking, with a season
best eight blocks. Another sopho
more, setter James Shaw, also con
tributed seven blocks.
While UCSB did lead at points
throughout each set, Stanford never
lost its composure, remaining confi
dent and continuing to control the
Gauchos' offense. The strong Cardinal
offense proved too much for
UCSB; the team struggled in
areas in which it normally ex
celled. The Gauchos seemed
overwhelmed by how aggres
sively the Cardinal played and
were hard-pressed to gain
any momentum during the
match.
Although Stanford had the
clear upper hand throughout
Friday's match against
UCSB, the Cardinal and No. 3
UCLA seemed equally
matched from the beginning
of the match on Monday
night. Stanford mounted a
comeback that barely fell
short of what would have been
quite the win for the Cardinal.
Instead, Stanford left Maples
with a heartbreaking loss and
once again an even record in
conference play as it fell 23-25,
26-28,25-20,25-19,15-17.
The fifth set saw Stanford

playing cateh-up, with the
Cardinal tying the match at
14-14. It was an intense final
set and the crowd really got
behind the team, helping push
Stanford to fight until the end.
But in the end, UCLA was
able to string together two
points in a row to beat the
Cardinal 17-15. UCLA had
seemed slightly more in con
trol the whole night, and they
used this confidence in the fi
nal two points of the match.
Senior Steven Irvin fin
ished with 17 kills and a
match-high 13 digs. Fellow
senior outside hitter Brian
Cook finished with 17 kills and
just one hitting error, hitting a
.400 for the match while also

recording four blocks. While
Stanford's offense was strong
throughout the match, UCLA
was able to capitalize on the
few errors the Card did have.
Furthermore, the Cardinal
did not take advantage of op
portunities it had to pull
ahead in the first two sets,
forcing it to play catch-up and
use its energy to come from
behind.
Stanford will return to the
road this week after a long
stretch at home and will
play No. 5 Long Beach State
on Feb. 28 and Cal State
Northridge on March 1.

short of what would have been
quite the win for the Cardinal.
Instead, Stanford left Maples
with a heartbreaking loss and
once again an even record in
conference play as it fell 23-25,
26-28,25-20,25-19,15-17.
The fifth set saw Stanford

playing cateh-up, with the
Cardinal tying the match at
14-14. It was an intense final
set and the crowd really got
behind the team, helping push
Stanford to fight until the end.
But in the end, UCLA was
able to string together two
points in a row to beat the
Cardinal 17-15. UCLA had
seemed slightly more in con
trol the whole night, and they
used this confidence in the fi
nal two points of the match.
Senior Steven Irvin fin
ished with 17 kills and a
match-high 13 digs. Fellow
senior outside hitter Brian
Cook finished with 17 kills and
just one hitting error, hitting a
.400 for the match while also

recording four blocks. While
Stanford's offense was strong
throughout the match, UCLA
was able to capitalize on the
few errors the Card did have.
Furthermore, the Cardinal
did not take advantage of op
portunities it had to pull
ahead in the first two sets,
forcing it to play catch-up and
use its energy to come from
behind.
Stanford will return to the
road this week after a long
stretch at home and will
play No. 5 Long Beach State
on Feb. 28 and Cal State
Northridge on March 1.

UCLA was able to
capitalize on the few
errors the Cardinal
did have.
The No. 8 Stanford men's volley
ball team hosted two top-five oppo
nents over the weekend, facing then-
No. 5 UC-Santa Barbara on Friday
and No. 3 UCLA on Monday. Stanford
went 1-1 for the two matches, sweep
ing UCSB but losing to UCLA in five
brutally close sets.
The Cardinal played impressive
volleyball, with consistent defense and
aggressive offense, and looked deter
mined throughout both games to stop
the cycle of wins and losses it has been
in all season. While Stanford ended
with a loss against UCLA, the match
was so close that if the last two points
had gone the other way, Stanford
would have left Maples Monday with a
win. Stanford is now 9-6 overall and 6-
6 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration.
Against No. 5 UCSB, Stanford
came out strong and steady, sweeping
the Gauchos 25-17,25-18,25-17. It was
Stanford's defense that was truly in
credible and the defining factor in the
win. Stanford limited the Gauchos to a
.011 hitting percentage for the match,
the second-lowest percentage record
ed by an opponent in Stanford's histo
ry. Stanford had an impressive block
ing night with an all-time record of
21.5 blocks and three players record
ing more than seven blocks for the
match.
Furthermore, the normally strong
UCSB offense recorded more errors
than kills for the night, with 11 errors
and only 10 kills. The Cardinal also
held UCSB to zero aces for the night,
which was critical to the Cardinal win
because UCSB's service game is nor
mally a strong advantage and a
weapon.
Senior opposite Eric Mochalski led
the Cardinal with 13 kills and had on
ly one error for the whole match. He
hit .667 while Stanford hit a consistent
.373 overall. Mochalski earned MPSF
Conference Player of the Week hon
ors for his performance against
UCSB. He had a season-high seven
digs and five blocks to go along with
his .667 hitting percentage. Sopho
more middle Conrad Kaminski led the
Cardinal in its blocking, with a season
best eight blocks. Another sopho
more, setter James Shaw, also con
tributed seven blocks.
While UCSB did lead at points
throughout each set, Stanford never
lost its composure, remaining confi
dent and continuing to control the
Gauchos' offense. The strong Cardinal
offense proved too much for
UCSB; the team struggled in
areas in which it normally ex
celled. The Gauchos seemed
overwhelmed by how aggres
sively the Cardinal played and
were hard-pressed to gain
any momentum during the
match.
Although Stanford had the
clear upper hand throughout
Friday's match against
UCSB, the Cardinal and No. 3
UCLA seemed equally
matched from the beginning
of the match on Monday
night. Stanford mounted a
comeback that barely fell
short of what would have been
quite the win for the Cardinal.
Instead, Stanford left Maples
with a heartbreaking loss and
once again an even record in
