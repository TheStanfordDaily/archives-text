## Monday loss spoils Friday win Late rally falls just short against UCLA 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 8 Stanford men's volley
ball team hosted two top-five oppo
nents over the weekend, facing then-
No. 5 UC-Santa Barbara on Friday
and No. 3 UCLA on Monday. Stanford
went 1-1 for the two matches, sweep
ing UCSB but losing to UCLA in five
brutally close sets.
The Cardinal played impressive
volleyball, with consistent defense and
aggressive offense, and looked deter
mined throughout both games to stop
the cycle of wins and losses it has been
in all season. While Stanford ended
with a loss against UCLA, the match
was so close that if the last two points
had gone the other way, Stanford
would have left Maples Monday with a
win. Stanford is now 9-6 overall and 6-
6 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration.
Against No. 5 UCSB, Stanford
came out strong and steady, sweeping
the Gauchos 25-17,25-18,25-17. It was
Stanford's defense that was truly in
credible and the defining factor in the
win. Stanford limited the Gauchos to a
.011 hitting percentage for the match,
the second-lowest percentage record
ed by an opponent in Stanford's histo
ry. Stanford had an impressive block
ing night with an all-time record of
21.5 blocks and three players record
ing more than seven blocks for the
match.
Furthermore, the normally strong
UCSB offense recorded more errors
than kills for the night, with 11 errors
and only 10 kills. The Cardinal also
held UCSB to zero aces for the night,
which was critical to the Cardinal win
because UCSB's service game is nor
mally a strong advantage and a
weapon.
Senior opposite Eric Mochalski led
the Cardinal with 13 kills and had on
ly one error for the whole match. He
hit .667 while Stanford hit a consistent
.373 overall. Mochalski earned MPSF
Conference Player of the Week hon
ors for his performance against
UCSB. He had a season-high seven
digs and five blocks to go along with
his .667 hitting percentage. Sopho
more middle Conrad Kaminski led the
Cardinal in its blocking, with a season
best eight blocks. Another sopho
more, setter James Shaw, also con
tributed seven blocks.
While UCSB did lead at points
throughout each set, Stanford never
lost its composure, remaining confi
dent and continuing to control the
Gauchos' offense. The strong Cardinal
