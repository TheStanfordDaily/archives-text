## Softball suffers its first three losses at Mary Nutter Classic 
### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Faced with the possibility of a
third consecutive loss after a 13-0
start to the regular season, the No.
13 Stanford softball team (14-3) dug
deep in the top of the seventh in
ning against Syracuse (4-6) on Sun
day morning of the Mary Nutter
Collegiate Classic, scoring three

runs to tie the game before drop
ping six runs on the Orange in the
Bth inning to win 11-5. While the
Card's schedule may say that Stan
ford went 2-3 in Cathedral City,
Calif, this past weekend, the win
loss record does not tell the com
plete story of a weekend in which
the Cardinal overcame its short
staffed pitching rotation with
strong resilience and effort.
With key players missing for the
Cardinal, freshman Madi Schreyer
rose to the occasion to deliver one
heroic start after another for Stan
ford throughout this weekend's
tournament. In particular, Schrey
er, a freshman from Woodinville,

Wash., started and pitched com
plete games in four out of the five
contests, including back-to-back
complete games on Sunday against
Syracuse and No. 2 Tennessee. In
total, Schreyer (11-2) threw 485
pitches in 28 innings of work at
Mary Nutter, while notching both
victories against Maryland and
Syracuse for Stanford.
Schreyer began the tournament
by pitching a masterpiece against
the Terrapins (1-14), as the 2012
Washington State Gatorade Player
of the Year allowed only four hits
and one unearned run in the Card's

injuries to other starting pitchers. Schreyer pitched four complete games over the weekend tournament.
2-1 victory. After Kayla Bon
strom made her first colle
giate start in the rotation
against No. 15 Baylor (12-3)
on Friday evening, Schreyer
returned to the circle against
No. 23 LSU (12-5) on Satur
day afternoon, throwing 135
pitches in a 5-3 loss to the
Tigers.
Despite the high number
of innings that she had al
ready logged at Mary Nutter,
Schreyer turned in a brilliant
performance against the La
dy Volunteers (13-0) in her
matchup with Vols star pitch
er Ellen Renfroe. Schreyer
kept Tennessee off-balance
for most of the contest, strik
ing out three Volunteers bat
ters while only allowing three
runs in a 3-1 loss.
Schreyer's efforts have
certainly been noticed by her
teammates, as junior Erin
Ashby was effusive in her
praise of Schreyer after last
weekend's Stanford Nike In
vitational, when the freshman
also logged a majority of the
innings in the circle for the
Cardinal.
"I have never been so im
pressed with Madi," Ashby
said. "She came in and pitched

any time she was needed...
she definitely held her own
this weekend and gave the
team the wins."
On offense, the Cardinal
struggled to consistently put
inns on the board against the
elite competition at Mary
Nutter. As a team, the Card
only hit .231 while scoring 18
runs in five games. However,
Stanford did receive some
timely performances at the
plate, particularly from Leah
White. White, a junior from
Phoenix, batted .429 over the
course of the weekend with a
double, two RBIs and four
runs scored.
White's best showing
came against the Syracuse
Orange, when the 2013 NF
CA All-West Region second
team selection went 3-for-4
with an RBI and three runs
scored. After drawing a lead
off walk to start the top of the
third inning, White had a bunt
single in the fifth and another
single up the middle in the top
of the seventh inning to help
key the Cardinal's furious ral
ly against the Orange. Finally,
White's single in the top of the
eighth inning plated Tyiyn
Wells from second, giving
Stanford a 7-5 lead.
In addition to Leah White,
Hanna Winter continued her
recent surge at the plate by
hitting .353 in 17 at-bats, with
an RBI, two doubles and five

inns scored. The junior from
Camarillo, Calif., also had a 3-
for-4 day at the plate against
Syracuse, as Winter was able
to drive home the winning run
in the top of Bth inning to give
the Cardinal a lead that it
would not relinquish. With
her success at the plate this
weekend, Winter was able to
raise her batting average to
.356 on the season.
Finally, freshman Kylie
Sorenson continued to deliver
for the Card, batting .357 with
three doubles and a team
leading three RBIs in five
games. In particular, Soren
son's single in the top of the
fifth inning against Baylor
scored the Card's only run of
the game, as the Bears would
hand the Cardinal its first loss
of the season by a 7-1 margin.
Sorenson also notched two
doubles in Stanford's victory
over Syracuse.
Stanford returns to action
this weekend, when the Car
dinal travels to Florida to par
ticipate in the Under Armour
Invitational. The Card will
play Central Arkansas and
South Florida on Friday in
Tampa before traveling to
Clearwater, Fla. on Saturday
and Sunday to take on Geor
gia State, Central Connecticut
State and Kennesaw State.
