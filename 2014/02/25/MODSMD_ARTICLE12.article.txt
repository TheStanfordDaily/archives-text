## Softball suffers its first three losses at Mary Nutter Classic 
### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Faced with the possibility of a
third consecutive loss after a 13-0
start to the regular season, the No.
13 Stanford softball team (14-3) dug
deep in the top of the seventh in
ning against Syracuse (4-6) on Sun
day morning of the Mary Nutter
Collegiate Classic, scoring three

runs to tie the game before drop
ping six runs on the Orange in the
Bth inning to win 11-5. While the
Card's schedule may say that Stan
ford went 2-3 in Cathedral City,
Calif, this past weekend, the win
loss record does not tell the com
plete story of a weekend in which
the Cardinal overcame its short
staffed pitching rotation with
strong resilience and effort.
With key players missing for the
Cardinal, freshman Madi Schreyer
rose to the occasion to deliver one
heroic start after another for Stan
ford throughout this weekend's
tournament. In particular, Schrey
er, a freshman from Woodinville,

Wash., started and pitched com
plete games in four out of the five
contests, including back-to-back
complete games on Sunday against
Syracuse and No. 2 Tennessee. In
total, Schreyer (11-2) threw 485
pitches in 28 innings of work at
Mary Nutter, while notching both
victories against Maryland and
Syracuse for Stanford.
Schreyer began the tournament
by pitching a masterpiece against
the Terrapins (1-14), as the 2012
Washington State Gatorade Player
of the Year allowed only four hits
and one unearned run in the Card's
