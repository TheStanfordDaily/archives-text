## CARD FACES DONS AT HOME 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Fresh off a much-needed win
in Austin, Tex. against the Long
horns, the Stanford baseball team
(3-4) returns home to Sunken Dia
mond to face the University of
San Francisco Dons (3-4) on Tues
day.
After a disappointing weekend
series that saw it drop two of
three against Texas, the Card
hopes to build off of its 11-run of
fensive display in Sunday's series
finale and boost its record in a

game in which it will be the fa
vorite. The Cardinal's sporadic of
fense has posted 32 runs so far
this season in its three wins but
only 10 runs in its four losses.
The Dons enter Tuesday's
game after a weekend visit to No.
2 Cal State Fullerton. On Friday,
USF outlasted one of the nation's
top teams in a seemingly never
ending game that finally conclud
ed with a 6-5 victory in the 19th in
ning thanks to a home run by jun
ior infielder Brendan Hendriks.
The Dons then suffered defeats of
11-0 and 5-1 on Saturday and Sun

day, respectively, to Fullerton.
Although Stanford has not offi
cially announced its starting
pitcher, the Cardinal will more
than likely send freshman pitcher
Tyler Thorne to the mound for his
second collegiate start. Thorne
pitched six innings, surrendered
only three runs and picked up the
win in his first start last Tuesday
against San Jose State. Combined
with his two relief appearances,
Thorne stands at 1-0 with a 2.35
ERA on the young season. Thorne
will continue the streak of
the Card's beginning-of-sea
son games with freshmen
starting on the mound
currently at seven straight.
Opposing Thorne and
taking the hill for the Dons
will likely be fellow fresh
man Grant Goodman. The
right-handed Goodman last
ed only 3.1 innings in his first
start against Kansas State,
allowing four runs two
earned in a game that the
Dons would eventually win.
Junior third baseman
Alex Blandino and senior sec
ond baseman and designated
hitter Brett Michael Doran

have been the highlights of
an up-and-down Cardinal
lineup so far this season. Do
ran tops the team with a .450
batting average while Blandi
no leads the Card with 10
hits. Blandino also connected
for his first home run of the
season, a two-run shot in the
Card's five-run sixth inning,
on Sunday against Texas af
ter hitting seven home runs
last season.
USF is led by junior cen
ter fielder Bradley Zimmer,
who tops the team with a
.429 batting average to go
along with a home run and
five RBIs on the season. The
speedy Zimmer normally
bats third behind the fresh
men tandem of Matt Sinatro
and Nico Giarratano. Sina
tro, the leadoff hitter who
splits time between left field

and second base, has strug
gled getting on base so far
this season with only seven
hits and none for extra
bases in 29 at-bats.
In last year's matchup at
Sunken Diamond, USF sur
prised then-No. 19 Stanford
by jumping out to a lead and
holding on for a 4-3 victory
after the Cardinal had just
taken two-of-three on the
road against Arizona State.
The Card fell to 26-17 overall
and would lose three
straight games afterwards
in a stretch that ultimately
doomed its chances at the
postseason.
First pitch is scheduled
for 5:30 p.m. at Sunken Dia
mond tonight.

FRANK CHEN/The Stanford Daily
Freshman pitcher Chris Viall (above) has performed well for the Cardinal in both of his
starts as Stanford remains the only team in the nation to start a freshman in every game.
