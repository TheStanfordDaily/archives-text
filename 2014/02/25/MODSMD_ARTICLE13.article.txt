## CARD FACES DONS AT HOME 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Fresh off a much-needed win
in Austin, Tex. against the Long
horns, the Stanford baseball team
(3-4) returns home to Sunken Dia
mond to face the University of
San Francisco Dons (3-4) on Tues
day.
After a disappointing weekend
series that saw it drop two of
three against Texas, the Card
hopes to build off of its 11-run of
fensive display in Sunday's series
finale and boost its record in a

game in which it will be the fa
vorite. The Cardinal's sporadic of
fense has posted 32 runs so far
this season in its three wins but
only 10 runs in its four losses.
The Dons enter Tuesday's
game after a weekend visit to No.
2 Cal State Fullerton. On Friday,
USF outlasted one of the nation's
top teams in a seemingly never
ending game that finally conclud
ed with a 6-5 victory in the 19th in
ning thanks to a home run by jun
ior infielder Brendan Hendriks.
The Dons then suffered defeats of
11-0 and 5-1 on Saturday and Sun

day, respectively, to Fullerton.
Although Stanford has not offi
cially announced its starting
pitcher, the Cardinal will more
than likely send freshman pitcher
Tyler Thorne to the mound for his
second collegiate start. Thorne
pitched six innings, surrendered
only three runs and picked up the
win in his first start last Tuesday
against San Jose State. Combined
with his two relief appearances,
Thorne stands at 1-0 with a 2.35
ERA on the young season. Thorne
