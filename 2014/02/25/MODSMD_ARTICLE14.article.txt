## SUPER TUESDAY Chelsea's Law: A Light to Shine On 
### Aimee Trujillo 
Today February 25,2014 I
want to take a moment to re
member the legacy of a girl
named Chelsea King.
Chelsea was an activist, a runner,
a student, a friend, a daughter, and a
spunky, charismatic, jovial bubble of
joy. This Tuesday marks the fourth
anniversary of Chelsea's disappear
ance from Poway, Calif., and eventu
al murder. While she no can longer
light up rooms with her smile or belt
out a tune on her French horn, her
legacy carries on today in the form
of Chelsea's Law.
Chelsea's Law protects Californi
a's children today with increased
penalties, parole provisions and over
sight for violent sexual offenders of
children. This law is specifically target
ed at criminals that our society cannot
risk letting loose again: Certain offens
es carry a one-strike punishment,
meaning that especially vicious crimes
would automatically merit life impris
onment without parole.
The rationale for such harsh sen
tences is clear: The Bureau of Jus
tice Statistics shows that child mo
lesters and statutory rapists re
leased from prison have a 5.1% re
cidivism rate 5.1% of these
criminals were rearrested for a
new sex crime within three
years of their release. While that
number does not seem very high,
over the course of many years, not
adopting a one-strike law would risk
the safety of many children.
Chelsea's Law is now in place in Cal
ifornia, and variants of it are being
pushed forward in other states to
prevent these avoidable tragedies.
This law protects society by
cracking down on crime. The Cali
fornia Three Strikes Law, enacted in
1994 in response to the murders of
Kimber Reynolds and Polly Klass,
has similar motivations. It requires
that any criminal offender with two
prior convictions for crimes deemed
serious or violent by the California
Penal Code be sentenced to a mini
mum of 25 years to life in prison.
While valiant in purpose, the
Three Strikes Law has done more
harm than good.
Unlike Chelsea's Law, the 1994
law does not specifically target any
type of crime. Instead, it uses un
clear, overly broad terms such as
"serious" and "violent" to condemn
any third-time offenders to life in
prison. Legally, the term "serious"
can include anything from murder to
kidnapping, extortion or arson, a
definition that, during sentencing,
essentially disregards the huge dif
ferences in these crimes.
The California State Auditor
found that in 2009,25% of inmates in
California institutions had been sen
tenced under the Three Strikes Law
and that the increased costs of the
law totaled $19.2 billion. But when
safety is on the line, it can be argued
that any cost is justified. In fact, the
Legislative Analyst's Office found
that crime rates fell by 43% between
1994 and 1999. Is that proof enough
to warrant the billions being spent
on this law?

No, it is not for several rea
sons. First off, the crime rate has
been declining since 1991, even be
fore the passage of the Three Strikes

Law, so the law has not necessarily
reduced crime in any major way.
Secondly, according to the California
Department of Corrections and Re
habilitation, over half (56%) of those
convicted for a third strike were con
victed because of a non-serious or
nonviolent offense. Lastly, this law
has proven to be racially biased to an
unacceptable degree, with 37% of
second and third strikers being
African American. (Only 6.6% of Cal
ifornia residents are African Ameri
can.)
In 2012 California made huge
progress by passing Proposition 36,
the Three Strikes Reform Act. This
legislation aims to shorten the sen
tences of those that are serving life
terms for non-serious, non-violent
crimes and who no longer pose a
threat to society. The reason for this
distinction is that, as a clinical psy
chologist from the Probation Service
of England and Wales points out,
this rehabilitation is not equally pos
sible for serious violent offenders,
like rapists.
So far, the legislation has been
targeted correctly: A Progress Re
port of this revision shows that those
released since the implementation of
this Proposition have only a 2% re
cidivism rate. This is good evidence
that the Proposition is only serving
to help those that are among the
safest to release from custody.
Proposition 36 is a crucial step
forward, but it cannot solve every
thing. The Three Strikes Law is still
straining society today. It has placed
an unnecessary burden on the Cali
fornia prison system that cannot be
so easily reversed. In the meantime,
the lengthy petition process for re
sentencing is now clogging Califor
nia courts. While papers are being
processed and cases are being re
viewed, people unfairly sentenced
still remain in prison, continuing to
raise prison costs and fill space that
is needed for more serious criminals.
The Three Strikes Law is a les
son to legislators and voters that
policies must be narrowly tailored to
society's most important ends.
Chelsea's Law is a reform that is do
ing just that.
Although the 25th of February is
always an emotional day, this year
we can also celebrate the legacy that
Chelsea is leaving through her
namesake law. Chelsea's Law contin
ues to protect California's children
from violent sexual predators as well
as carry out the due process of law
by avoiding the pitfalls of overgener
alization that the Three Strikes Law
still suffers from. Today is a day of
renewed hope for a better future. To
day is a day to remember that
Chelsea's light continues to shine on.
