## The
						Pitfalls of California's Three Strikes Law 
### Anthony Ghosn 
Recidivism is a serious issue in
our criminal justice system
and it deserves its due atten
tion. Fifty-three percent of males
released from jail are re-incarcerat
ed, which is especially worrying in a
nation that has the highest incar
ceration rate in the world. Noticing
this trend, Californians instituted
the three-strike system in 1994 as
Proposition 184, which mandates
that the third of three felonies be
punished extremely harshly usu
ally with a life sentence.

Hard data on the effects of the
three-strike system is difficult to
come by, especially because it is dif
ficult for sociologists to confidently
parse trends and distinguish be
tween correlation and causation
when it comes to something as com
plex as criminal decisions. Unfortu
nately, there is no hard data sug
gesting or, to be fair, refuting
a direct causal link between the di

minishing number of violent crimes
and felonies in California and the
Three Strikes Law.

The law nonetheless costs the
state approximately half a billion
dollars a year. It targets many who
have committed theft-related
felonies and non-violent crimes.
Moreover, African Americans are
disproportionately represented
amongst those who are charged for
second and third strikes.
There are countless articles on
absurd applications of the law. The
New York Times and the Huffing
ton Post have characterized it as be
ing "draconian". The Stanford Law
School's Three Strikes Project has
claimed that 40% of those charged
with the third strike are mentally
ill. Although a 5-4 Supreme Court
decision decided that the law was
not a violation of the Eighth
Amendment the protection
against cruel and unusual punish-

ment â€”it is clear that this ap
proach has its problems.

The Three Strikes Law is the
perfect illustration of the politics of
retribution. The implicit moral logic
of this measure is that this kind of
rational punitive structure causes
intelligent criminals to avoid recidi
vism. As a state, when we accept
narratives that satisfy our collec
tively limited understanding of a
phenomena as complex as recidi
vism, we end up with a highly ex
pensive and arguably draconian
program such as this.
Laws, particularly those that ul
timately have the power to confis
cate the basic freedoms of our citi
zens, must be subject to rigorous
review after they are put in place. It
is also important that they are
based in legitimate jurisprudence to
prevent such a situation as this one.
