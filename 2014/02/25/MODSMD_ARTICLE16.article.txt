## The 						Pitfalls of California's Three Strikes Law 
### Anthony Ghosn 
Recidivism is a serious issue in
our criminal justice system
and it deserves its due atten
tion. Fifty-three percent of males
released from jail are re-incarcerat
ed, which is especially worrying in a
nation that has the highest incar
ceration rate in the world. Noticing
this trend, Californians instituted
the three-strike system in 1994 as
Proposition 184, which mandates
that the third of three felonies be
punished extremely harshly usu
ally with a life sentence.

Hard data on the effects of the
three-strike system is difficult to
come by, especially because it is dif
ficult for sociologists to confidently
parse trends and distinguish be
tween correlation and causation
when it comes to something as com
plex as criminal decisions. Unfortu
nately, there is no hard data sug
gesting or, to be fair, refuting
a direct causal link between the di

minishing number of violent crimes
and felonies in California and the
Three Strikes Law.

The law nonetheless costs the
state approximately half a billion
dollars a year. It targets many who
have committed theft-related
felonies and non-violent crimes.
Moreover, African Americans are
disproportionately represented
amongst those who are charged for
second and third strikes.
There are countless articles on
absurd applications of the law. The
New York Times and the Huffing
ton Post have characterized it as be
ing "draconian". The Stanford Law
School's Three Strikes Project has
claimed that 40% of those charged
with the third strike are mentally
ill. Although a 5-4 Supreme Court
decision decided that the law was
not a violation of the Eighth
Amendment the protection
against cruel and unusual punish-

ment —it is clear that this ap
proach has its problems.

The Three Strikes Law is the
perfect illustration of the politics of
retribution. The implicit moral logic
of this measure is that this kind of
rational punitive structure causes
intelligent criminals to avoid recidi
vism. As a state, when we accept
narratives that satisfy our collec
tively limited understanding of a
phenomena as complex as recidi
vism, we end up with a highly ex
pensive and arguably draconian
program such as this.
Laws, particularly those that ul
timately have the power to confis
cate the basic freedoms of our citi
zens, must be subject to rigorous
review after they are put in place. It
is also important that they are
based in legitimate jurisprudence to
prevent such a situation as this one.
Take this very basic sta
tistical set: Criminals who
commit a property crime are
13.9% more likely to relapse,
where as those who commit
violent crimes are 31.9% less
likely to do so. Moreover,
criminals are 1.2% less likely
to recommit a crime for
every year they spend in
prison. On average those
criminals who were convict
ed for a repeat offense at
least once are 58.1% more
likely to recommit a crime.
Your likelihood of going back
to jail drops 2.9% for every
year of education you have
and younger offenders are
much more likely to reoffend
than older ones.
These statistics suggest
that the most likely third
strike offenders have com

mitted property crimes like
petty theft, have spent a rel
atively small amount of time
in jail and are young and un
educated. It seems that the
most disadvantaged seg
ment of the population is in
curring this extra wrath of
the Three Strikes Law.
This reality is far from
the popular characterization
of the law as a deterrent to
the kind of violent crimes
that were prevalent leading
up to the adoption of that
law. If the government in
sists on spending such a
large portion of its budget on
combating recidivism, it
must ask itself who is bear
ing the brunt of this intense
punishment and why.
Combating recidivism is
a complex issue, and I don't
have concrete policy solu
tions that I believe in. I do
think that increasing educa
tion standards and, by at
tracting businesses to Cali
fornia, helping those who

would otherwise steal find
work would be a good first
step to reducing the overall
rate of recidivism in the
state. And ultimately, the
policies we do approve
should be based on research
instead of moral platitudes.
Instead, we find our
selves in a situation where
political expediency has tak
en precedence over logic and
statistics, and where those
who are in jail today are the
most disenchanted members
of our society. It is over
whelmingly clear that the
Three Strikes Law is neither
a proper tool to deter recidi
vism nor an intelligent way
to distribute the state's
budget. Since the Californ
ian population clearly in
tends to address this prob
lem, lawmakers should look
to the causes of the problem
rather than its effects.

of this measure is that this kind of

Take this very basic sta
tistical set: Criminals who
commit a property crime are
13.9% more likely to relapse,
where as those who commit
violent crimes are 31.9% less
likely to do so. Moreover,
criminals are 1.2% less likely
to recommit a crime for
every year they spend in
prison. On average those
criminals who were convict
ed for a repeat offense at
least once are 58.1% more
likely to recommit a crime.
Your likelihood of going back
to jail drops 2.9% for every
year of education you have
and younger offenders are
much more likely to reoffend
than older ones.
These statistics suggest
that the most likely third
strike offenders have com

mitted property crimes like
petty theft, have spent a rel
atively small amount of time
in jail and are young and un
educated. It seems that the

curring this extra wrath of
the Three Strikes Law.
This reality is far from
the popular characterization
of the law as a deterrent to
the kind of violent crimes
that were prevalent leading

combating recidivism, it
must ask itself who is bear

punishment and why.

a complex issue, and I don't

think that increasing educa

would otherwise steal find
work would be a good first
step to reducing the overall
rate of recidivism in the
state. And ultimately, the
policies we do approve
should be based on research
instead of moral platitudes.
Instead, we find our
selves in a situation where
political expediency has tak

who are in jail today are the

Three Strikes Law is neither
a proper tool to deter recidi

tends to address this prob
lem, lawmakers should look
to the causes of the problem
rather than its effects.

Recidivism is a serious issue in
our criminal justice system
and it deserves its due atten
tion. Fifty-three percent of males
released from jail are re-incarcerat
ed, which is especially worrying in a
nation that has the highest incar
ceration rate in the world. Noticing
this trend, Californians instituted
the three-strike system in 1994 as
Proposition 184, which mandates
that the third of three felonies be
punished extremely harshly usu
ally with a life sentence.

Hard data on the effects of the
three-strike system is difficult to
come by, especially because it is dif
ficult for sociologists to confidently
parse trends and distinguish be
tween correlation and causation
when it comes to something as com
plex as criminal decisions. Unfortu
nately, there is no hard data sug
gesting or, to be fair, refuting
a direct causal link between the di

minishing number of violent crimes
and felonies in California and the
Three Strikes Law.

The law nonetheless costs the
state approximately half a billion
dollars a year. It targets many who
have committed theft-related
felonies and non-violent crimes.
Moreover, African Americans are
disproportionately represented
amongst those who are charged for
second and third strikes.
There are countless articles on
absurd applications of the law. The
New York Times and the Huffing
ton Post have characterized it as be
ing "draconian". The Stanford Law
School's Three Strikes Project has
claimed that 40% of those charged
with the third strike are mentally
ill. Although a 5-4 Supreme Court
decision decided that the law was
not a violation of the Eighth
Amendment the protection
against cruel and unusual punish-

ment —it is clear that this ap
proach has its problems.
