# Separate and Unequal: Discriminatory Policies in Israel and Palestine
## 
### Kristian Bailey 
This week marks the ninth
annual international Is
raeli Apartheid Week,
which serves to highlight the
Israeli state's systematic dis
crimination and, human rights
violations against Palestini
ans and to build the global
Boycott, Divestment and Sanc
tions (BDS) movement that
seeks to hold Israel account
able to its international hu
manitarian law obligations.
For soma, the word
apartheid is controversial.
Without commenting on the
term myself, I offer three snip
pets of life in Palestine from
the five weeks I spent living
there last summer to alloiv stu
dents to decide for themselves.
Part one will focus on some in
visible aspects of the Israeli oc
cupation of Palestine Is
raeli control of Palestinian in

frastructure and development.
Part two will focus on how
Palestinian activists are treat
ed by Israel, with a focus on
Stanford alumnus Fadi Quran
'lO. Part three will highlight
the experience of everyday
Palestinians, who seek life's
basic liberties while living un
der occupation. I will conclude
the series next week with my
own analysis of the term
'apartheid.'
At the beginning of my time in
Israel and Palestine, I went on a
tour of settlements in East
Jerusalem and the West Bank with
Jeff Halper, co-founder of the Is
raeli Committee against Housing
Demolitions (ICAHD). To those
who are unfamiliar with Israeli
settlements, they are outposts
where Israelis set up villages on
land that is internationally
recognized as belonging to
the Palestinian people. They
are illegal under interna
tional law, which prohibits
an occupying military power
from transferring its citi
zens to the territory they
administer. In some cases,
Israelis kick Palestinians
out of their homes; in oth
ers, they build on land that
the Palestinians cannot re
ceive permits to build upon.
The settlements usually
come with many resources
paved roads, sidewalks,
grass, malls, olive trees that
are hundreds of years old
and uprooted from Palestin
ian villages, and more. We
saw an Olympic-sized swim
ming pool in one of the
more developed settle
ments. We also saw a huge
decorative fountain at the
base of a valley, complete
with grass and a couple of
palm trees. This site may
not seem abnormal, but
when you consider that the
rest of the area looked like a
desert, and that Palestinians
in the West Bank only re
ceive 15% of the water that
comes from their land, this
story changes very quickly.
Water control is one of
the invisible but vital issues
of the occupation. On oppo

site sides of the highway on
the drive from Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem, you can see evi
dence of separate and un
equal treatment of Israelis
and Palestinians. You can
determine the distinction
between Palestinian villages
and Israeli settlements in
the West Bank by looking at
their roofs. Palestinians
have multiple black water
towers peppered all over
every roof. The Israeli set
tlements either have no wa
ter towers at all (they have
24/7 access to water) or
small white storage tanks
that are noticeably smaller
than the Palestinian ones.
In this area and in places
across the West Bank, Is
rael supplies Palestinians
with water as little as once a
week. Palestinians gather
water in these tanks to use
during the outages, but
have to allot the resources
accordingly. Israeli settlers
and soldiers sometimes tar
get these water tanks for
attacks.
In East Jerusalem,
Palestinian areas do not get
serviced by public buses,
garbage collectors or ambu
lances (to call an ambulance
requires a police escort). Is
rael captured East Jerusalem
at the end of the Six Day War
in 1967 and claims East and
West Jerusalem as the uni
fied and eternal capital of Is
rael, though it is technically
occupied territory, just like
the West Bank. While Israel

should not be in East
Jerusalem under interna
tional law, since it treats the
city as its territory, it is
practicing de facto segrega
tion by not providing serv
ices to people who pay tax
es and live in its capital,
based on their ethnicity.
The roads we saw in East
Jerusalem are significantly
narrower, frequently have
no sidewalks and are
strewn with trash when
they do exist.
This distinction is cur
rently being established
even further, as Israel is cur
rently building a separate
highway for Palestinians in
the West Bank on a road
that is currently shared be
tween illegal Israeli settlers
and Palestinians. Once the
road is completed, a wall will
divide the highway between
Palestinians and Israeli set
tlers, only the latter of
whom will have direct access
to Jerusalem. Palestinians
living in the West Bank are
not allowed to enter
Jerusalem under most cir
cumstances.

The issue of settlers may
seem distant, but there is a
lot of American involvement
in this process. Jeff Halper
from ICAHD spoke to us
about one American who do
nated a police station for il
legal Israeli settlers in or
der to convert the old police
station into condominiums
for additional settlers. To be

clear: a private US citizen
gifted a police station to a
national government to
grow the illegal occupation
of land halfway across the
world.
Similarly, at one settle
ment stop, the billboard for
the project featured an
American number and a
U.S. contact person to in
quire about more details.
In the entire time I was
in the region, I could not
wrap my mind around the
existence of the settle
ments, the discrepancy in
resources between villages
immediately next to each
other and the fact that the
settlements are blatantly il
legal yet approved by the
Israeli government anyway.
What is clear is that the so
ciety we are looking into is
one that is separate and un
equal. We cannot allow such
discrimination to remain.
