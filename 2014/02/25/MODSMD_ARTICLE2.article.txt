# Students awarded new 'fun grants'
## Recipients given $100 each to pursue personal projects 
### ALEX ZIVKOVIC DESK EDITOR 
Five proposals from members
of the junior class have received
$lOO "Winter Quarter Fun
Grants" from the Junior Class
Cabinet in the initiative's first
year.
First imagined during a
d.school brainstorming session in
an effort to foster the creation of
new, high-quality events and op
portunities for the junior class,
the pilot program received 35
proposals.

"This is a chance to do any
thing you can imagine for your
friends, for your community, for
your class, for yourself—just tell
us why!" wrote Natalya Thakur
'l5, one of six junior class presi
dents, in an email to all juniors at
the start of February.
Megan Kurohara 'l5, another
class president, emphasized that
the purpose of this grant is to help
personal projects. Thakur ex
plained that such projects might
include helping out a friend in
need or thanking resident fellows
or staff.
This year's winners drew inspi
ration from a number of sources to
come up with their proposals, from a
literature-inspired idea to resolving
real technical issues on campus.
Michael Stern 'l5 kept his pro
posal simple.
"Essentially, I just want to give
out 50-dollar bills, matching 100 dol
lars from the junior class with a hun
dred dollars of my own," he ex
plained. "Giving 50 dollars to anyone
here on campus, to someone in our
community someone who looks
like they could need it."
Stern said that the idea had come
to him from a novel.
"I [got] inspiration from a book
that I recently read called 'Moon
Palace' where a character in it does
a similar thing so I thought it would
be really cool to try it out," Stern
said.
For Sasha Spivak 'l5 and Alicia
Seta 'l5, who collaborated on a pro
posal, the money will not immediate
ly produce real change but will in
stead help fund the start of a larger
project.
"We want to build a geodesic jun
gle gym full-scale, 25-square feet
around and we want to build it
somewhere on campus because
there isn't a lot of interactive ait on
campus," Seta explained. "There's a
lot of abstract sculptures, but noth
ing that is really built for users."
In the pursuit of this end, Spivak
and Seta hope to build a wood mod
el of the dome, using the $lOO for the
wood and plastic parts. They em
phasized that a model is necessary
for the long-term goals of the proj
ect.
"There's a lot of analysis that
goes into the statics of the structure
and you also want to test it on a
physical model to scale," Spivak
said.
"There's a lot of insight you can
gain from having a physical model
instead of just doing calculations,"
Seta added.
The two anticipate finishing a
model by the start of spring quarter
at the latest. After the model is cre
ated, they hope to eventually build a
version with actual metal instead of
wood.
"Once we finish calculations and
building our first model, by the end
of that we'll have a lot of information
about building... and with all of that
information, then we will feel com
fortable going to department heads
and actually proposing to build this,"
Seta said.

On the other hand, Walter Torres
'15 said that he saw the grant pro
posals as a chance to fix a recurring
issue for his band, Siberian Front.
"I'm playing in a rock band right
now and we are just now starting to
play shows and Stanford has a very
nice space inside Stern Dining but
some of the equipment isn't up to
par so our singer has a lot of trouble
being heard in the practice room,"
Torres said.
For Torres, the grant money will
help subsidize the cost of anticipated
purchases.
"The new system is going to cost
about 250 bucks so I think this will
cover just part of that cost," he said.
"We'll just turn in a receipt for what
ever we buy — we'll make a
thoughtful choice."
Justin Brown '15, who has stud
ied circus arts for more than eight
years, will use his grant money to
support the start of a group that
brings together other students with
skills in contortion, aerial fabrics
and unicycling. Brown said that
while he knows close to 10 such stu
dents, he hopes to reach out to other
potential members with the propos
al money, which will fund advertis
ing for and snacks at an interest
meeting, before continuing to devel
op the group.
"[We'll bring] together some kind
of showcase event and, depending
on level of interest, actually making
it a student group to get funding
from the University" he said.
Alex Pittman '15, the final win
ner, plans to build a "MobiliChair"
that provides a source of electric
power for wheelchair users who can
not afford completely electric power
chairs. He will use the funds to up
grade a design he created last quar
ter.
Proposal winners will write a fol
low-up reflection describing the way
the money was used and the results
of the project, which will be featured
alongside the winners on the Class
of 2015 Facebook group.
