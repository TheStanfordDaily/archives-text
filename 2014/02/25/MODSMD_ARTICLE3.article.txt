## University committees attract fewer applicants 
### PETER MOON DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
The 2014 Nominations Commit
tee (NomCom) a seven-member
group charged with selecting student
representatives to University com
mittees —has experienced a decline
in student interest compared to previ
ous years, with the number of appli
cants falling from 227 last year to 203
this year.
This year's applicants could ap
ply to 49 University committees — a
decline from last year's total of 51
ranging from Board of Trustees
committees to the Board of Judicial
Affairs. Following an interview
process, successful applicants are
confirmed by a simple majority vote
from either the ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate or the Graduate Student
Council (GSC), depending on their
affiliation.
According to ASSU co-president

Dan Ashton 'l4, the University com
mittees complement the Senate and
GSC in terms of serving as impor
tant avenues for student opinions
and concerns to be voiced.
"Most of the power students
have is vested in the [University]
committees," Ashton said. "Stan
ford undergraduate students have
appointees [selected by] the Nomi
nations Committee to help repre
sent student opinion."
NomCom member Sarah
Houamed 'l7 acknowledged that the
committee had made an effort to
market the role of student represen
tatives in a different way to previous
year's.
"Marketing was a big concern of
ours, because last year there were
some gaps in applications,"
Houamed said. "Sometimes there
were very few [applicants] from
certain demographics or [there
were] certain committees that didn't
get many applications."
"We really wanted to reach dif
ferent areas of campus," she added.
"We have a very diverse group [of
applicants], [including] law students,
graduate students [and] Ph.D. stu
dents."

NomCom co-chair Anuj Patel 'l6
noted that applications for some
committees may reopen in the fu
ture, following the appointment of
representatives to Board of Trustees
and Academic Council committees.
