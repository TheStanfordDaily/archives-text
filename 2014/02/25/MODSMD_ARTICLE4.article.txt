## Campus farm copes with Calif, drought 
### CHRISTINA GIBBS 
The Stanford Community Farm,
a one-acre field located on the out
skirts of campus, has implemented
moisture-trapping gardening tech
niques in order to mitigate water us
age, in response to the ongoing
shortage of rainfall throughout Cali
fornia.
The Community Farm functions
as an organic farm comprised of
plots of varying sizes as well as
chicken pens and orchards, and is di
vided between educational and com

munity uses. The latter is open to
students and Stanford employees,
according to Liz Stone, a retired em
ployee of the Stanford Hospital who
uses the farm.
Patrick Archie, a farm educator
and a lecturer at the School of Earth
Sciences, has facilitated the farm's
adaptation to the drought over the
past two years by using farming
techniques aimed at using water
more efficiently and reducing overall
usage. To that end, Archie set up
drip-watering systems that he esti
mated as being 80- to 90-percent

more efficient due to plants having
more time to absorb a more limited
amount of water.
Two members of the community
garden Christine Martens, a lab
manager at the School of Medicine,
and Ed Mocarski, professor emeri
tus of microbiology and immunology
said that they agreed with the
new limits on watering and would
continue to use mulch and compost
to increase the moisture retention in
their soil.

The University has implemented measures for coping with the statewide water shortage that range from
turning off its iconic fountains across campus to trying new gardening techniques to reduce water usage.
