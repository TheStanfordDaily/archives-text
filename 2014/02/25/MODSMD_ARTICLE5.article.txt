## Researchers improve cystic fibrosis test 
### SILVIANA ILCUS 
A team of Stanford researchers re
cently found that smaller amounts of a
particular protein are necessary to pre
vent cystic fibrosis than had been previ
ously believed, in a research effort that
also produced a new and more effective
sweat test for measuring patients' pro
tein levels.
Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder
characterized by thick, viscous secre
tions that affect the lungs, the pancreas,
the liver or the intestine. It is one of the
most widespread life-shortening genetic
diseases, affecting one in 3,500 newborns
in the United States.
In developing the new sweat test, the
Stanford research team took advantage
of a key property of sweat glands.

The test apparatus consists of a digital camera, a plastic
object with LEDs and a hole that acts as an oil layer
reservoir. Testers use the hole to determine the scale
of the sweat bubbles, while the LEDs light the circumference
of the bubbles.
