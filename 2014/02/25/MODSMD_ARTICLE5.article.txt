## Researchers improve cystic fibrosis test 
### SILVIANA ILCUS 
A team of Stanford researchers re
cently found that smaller amounts of a
particular protein are necessary to pre
vent cystic fibrosis than had been previ
ously believed, in a research effort that
also produced a new and more effective
sweat test for measuring patients' pro
tein levels.
Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder
characterized by thick, viscous secre
tions that affect the lungs, the pancreas,
the liver or the intestine. It is one of the
most widespread life-shortening genetic
diseases, affecting one in 3,500 newborns
in the United States.
In developing the new sweat test, the
Stanford research team took advantage
of a key property of sweat glands.

object with LEDs and a hole that acts as an oil layer
reservoir. Testers use the hole to determine the scale
of the sweat bubbles, while the LEDs light the circumference
of the bubbles.
sweat gland has two ways of pro
ducing sweat," noted Jeffrey Wine,
professor of human biology and the
team's leader.
One of these mechanisms does
not require CFTR, the protein that
is defective in cystic fibrosis; the
other one, meanwhile, reflects the
amount of functional CFTR in a lin
ear manner.

The sweat test developed by the
research team is carried out using
an apparatus designed by the re
search team. According to Jessica
Char, a psychology research assis
tant and primary author of the
study, an oil reservoir is placed on a
small circular patch of skin on the
subject's arm. LED lights are
placed around the circular patch of
skin, illuminating the circumference
of the sweat bubbles, and a digital
camera placed above the circular
patch of skin monitors the secretion
of sweat.

Through injections of different
chemicals, the researchers stimu
late the glands to produce sweat or
block the secretion of traditional
sweat. The team was also able to de
velop a blue water-soluble dye that
allowed them to visualize these bub
bles. The ratio between the volume
of CFTR-dependent and independ
ent sweat bubbles is subsequently
measured.

According to Wine, the newly
developed test is more useful be
cause it allows researchers to obtain
up to 50 measures from the same
patient, as opposed to classic sweat
tests that measure the ratio be
tween the total amount of sweat of
two different types produced in an
individual and only provide one data
point per patient.
Using these new methods, the
group investigated the effect of Iva

caftor, a drug used to treat cystic fi
brosis in patients who have a muta
tion that occurs in up to five percent
of cases of cystic fibrosis. They
found that Ivacaftor increases the
amount of functional CFTR by up
to nearly 10 percent compared to
the healthy control group.
Wine noted that since big
clinical trials indicate that the
symptoms of patients on Ivacaftor
are greatly alleviated the team's
research offers the first suggestion
that not much functional CFTR is
needed to support better health.
In the future, the team plans to
further improve and refine their
sweat test device.

"We want to get away from all
this apparatus and convert this sen
sor into some kind of solid state sen
sor," Wine said. "We would like it to
be the case that a trained nurse
could slap this on a patient's arm
and analyze the data."
