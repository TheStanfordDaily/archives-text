## The Olympics never fail to entertain
### Ashley Westhem 
Bring on the tissues and
chocolate, because I'm
definitely feeling the wa
terworks and with
drawals fast approaching
now that the 2014 Sochi Winter
Olympics have come to a close. All in
all, Russia managed to pull it off.
I'm not going to go so far as to say
that it was a Winter Olympics location
to be revisited anytime soon in future
considerations of the International
Olympic Committee, but considering
this was the first time Russia hosted
the Olympics since the Cold War days,
it probably exceeded most people's
low expectations including mine.
I wrote a column back in July
about how Russia's initial approach to
the treatment of gay spectators and
athletes during the Olympics was dis
ruptive to the spirit of the Games be
cause Russia used the Games as an op
portunity to get on its political soapbox
and make an international statement.
The whole point of the Games is to uni
fy the world, transcend borders and put
social, economic and political differ
ences aside for two and a half weeks.
Thankfully the backlash Russia re
ceived was enough for Putin to change
his tone and make the Olympics a
more amiable experience for all. Un
fortunately, the start of the Olympics
was not amenable for most, especially
for the media. Light fixtures and cur
tains fell just inches from people's
beds; doorknobs came off while being
turned; water, and more importantly,
clean water as opposed to the gin
that was plentiful—was scarce; pow
er outages were rampant and toilets
were not properly installed. Mean
while, people were horrified upon
hearing Russia's solution to the stray
dog situation. Not cool, Putin.
Oh, and let's not forget that U.S.
bobsledder Johnny Quinn had to
punch his way out of a hotel bathroom
in Sochi's Olympic Village.
The ice was another issue as well.
Sochi, typically a resort town known
for its mild climate, did not provide the
weather necessary to maintain a Win
ter Olympics. The temperature crept
up while the snow became slushy then
icy—frankly, just not ideal. It was
made evident during the final runs of
the men's slalom that something was
wrong with the course and it wasn't
just technical errors of the athletes
when 30 athletes wiped out and were
unable to finish. This made the people
think twice about the complaints re
garding the half pipe perhaps those
complaints weren't unfounded.
Despite the conditions and the un
fortunate absence of Bob Costas to
pink eye for a few days, NBC's cover
age of the Games prevailed and
brought unforgettable moments for
the U.S. into the homes of millions of
viewers during these Winter
Olympics. Although Russia won the fi
nal medal count, the United States had
its own shining moments.
After skating together for 17 years
and falling just short of the gold medal
in Vancouver, Meiyl Davis and Charlie
White won the United States' first
gold medal in ice dancing with a capti
vating program that melted hearts.
Mikaela Shiffrin shined in the
women's slalom as she became the
youngest female Olympian to win gold
in the event. Ted Ligety also prevailed
in alpine skiing by winning gold in the
giant slalom.
Noelle Pikus-Pace won silver in
skeleton (sliding down razor-sharp ice
on your stomach) after overcoming se
rious physical and mental hurdles.
Men's bobsled athletes also performed
impressively and were driven to
bronze by Steven Holcomb despite his
strained calf, which he said he would
just bite down and bear.
The Americans became the first to
win the Olympics' new event of
slopestyle snowboarding, as Sage Kot
senburg gave a mind-blowing gold
medal run for the men's event, while
Jamie Anderson won gold on the
women's end.
In what was most likely his last
Olympics for the super-giant slalom,
Bode Miller won bronze in his signa
ture risky throw-caution-to-the-wind
style.
I'll be counting down the years,
then months and days until the 2016
Summer Olympics in Rio, when I can
celebrate my favorite time of year
again. Until then, the high caliber of
Stanford athletics will have to do.
