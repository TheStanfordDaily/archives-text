THE PRESIDENT'S AWARDS FOR EXCELLENCE THROUGH DIVERSITY

students who add to Stanford's diversity (broadly defined); exceptional mentoring of
students whose background, experience, and interests contribute to diversity; develop
ment and implementation of advancement opportunities for our diverse population
of employees; development of curricular and/or research projects on topics focusing
on peoples' identities, origins and cultures within the United States and globally that
enrich students' education in novel ways; and development or enhancement of activities
that build community within and among diverse groups of students, faculty, and staff.
Two awards are usually made each year to:
• An individual from among the faculty, students, and staff
• A campus unit such as a department, program or office
