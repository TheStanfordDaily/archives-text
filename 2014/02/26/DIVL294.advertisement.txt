Stanford Continuing Studies presents
Ken Berman Trio: Sound Poetry in Performance
Friday, February 28
8:00 pm
Dinkelspiel Auditorium
Stanford University
Free and open to the public
Celebrated as an artist of fierce imagination and singular vision,
pianist and composer Ken Berman will unveil his latest project,
Sound Poetry, at Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Berman's acclaimed
trio, featuring Kai Eckhardt and Akira Tana, seamlessly navigates
the terrain between tradition and innovation through its
extemporaneous explorations. Born out of Berman's friendship
with the late poet Eythan Klamka (1967-2011), Sound Poetry
builds on Klamka's notion that "any good musician is a sound
poet," and seeks to explore the intersection between musical
and poetic lyricism. Berman draws inspiration from a range of
diverse sources: Zen practitioner Thich Nhat Hanh, W.B. Yeats,
Langston Hughes, Allen Ginsberg, George Gershwin, Bob Dylan,
Duke Ellington, Lester Young, Billy Strayhorn, Bill Evans, Wayne
Shorter, and Bill Frisell â€”all of whose unique contributions
continue to be guideposts and indicate the realm of possibility
in improvisatory art.
