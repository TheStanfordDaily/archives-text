## Will this finally be the Year of the Tiger? 
### Vihan Lakshman 
I was eleven years old, chocolate
ice cream smeared across the
edges of my mouth, sitting
inches away from the TV
screen and making all kinds of
crazy deals with God.
"I promise to do all of my home
work ... I'll clean my r00m... I'll do
everything my mom says," I pleaded.
"Just let Tiger win."
The final round of the 2005 Mas
ters was the first golf telecast that I
watched in its entirety. (It was also,
incidentally, the day I met my good
friends Ben and Jerry). As the sun
slowly worked its way across the sky,
scattering golden rays of light
through the ancient pines of Augusta
National, I became obsessed
hooked on the game of golf, fascinat
ed by the magic of the Masters and
simply mesmerized by the aura of
Tiger Woods.
In the course of watching Woods'
epic duel with Chris DiMarco on the
back nine, I'm not sure exactly why I
became such a diehard Tiger fan.
Maybe I knew he was arguably the
best athlete in the world and I just
jumped on the bandwagon. Or, per
haps, I gravitated towards Woods be
cause he was the golfer out there who
looked the most like me.
At any rate, I remember pressing
my face against the TV when Tiger's
chip shot on the par-316th teased the
edge of the cup before letting out a
scream that might have been heard a
hundred miles away in Augusta. As
he has done so many times, Tiger
turned a game of knocking a ball in a
hole on really short grass into a mys
tical experience.
Those moments, though, have
been few and far between in recent
years. It's still hard for me to believe
that Woods has not won a green jack
et since that day in 2005. Thanks to
Tiger, I'm starting to feel old at the
age of 20.
Prior to the scandal in 2009,
breaking Jack Nieklaus' record of 18
major championships seemed like it
would be a mere blip on the radar of
Tiger's bigger quest to challenge the
likes of Michael Jordan, Babe Ruth
and Muhammad Ali as the greatest
athletes of all time. Now, with his in
vincibility shattered and his inability
to knock down a six-foot putt when it
matters most the trademark of
vintage Tiger—Woods stands in a
position unthinkable a decade ago: set
to go down as not even the greatest
player in his sport.
But it's not too late. As Nieklaus
demonstrated at the 1998 Masters
and Tom Watson showed at the 2009
Open Championship, golfers in their
late fifties can still play at the high
est level. Tiger still has every oppor
tunity to right the ship and hit that
magic number of 19; with that being
said, the pressure will continue to
mount the longer Woods continues
his major drought currently at
four years. As a result, it's absolutely
crucial for him to close out the compe
tition at a major once again sooner
rather than later.
And 2014 will be the perfect year
to do it.
In my opinion, the most telling in
sight into Tiger's success —one
that's gone largely ignored by many
golf analysts —is the fact that he
dominates courses he likes and rarely
wins on tracks that don't quite fit his
eye. His 79 PGA tour victories have
come at only 25 different locations.
That's why 2014 is so important.
All four of this year's major venues
are courses at which Tiger has found
success in the past.
Even in his so called "down years"
in the aftermath of his scandal, Woods
has pulled out top-10 finishes at the
Masters in 2010, 2011 and 2013. He
clearly loves Augusta and the
course loves him back. No matter
the state of his game entering April,
he always seems to find the magic at
Amen Corner.
The U.S. Open this year returns
to Pinehurst No. 2 in North Carolina,
where Woods finished third to Payne
Stewart in 1999 and second to
Michael Campbell in 2005. Of the four
major venues in 2014, Pinehurst is the
only course where he's failed to win,
but he's come excruciatingly close in
the past.
Across the pond, the Open Cham
pionship returns to Royal Liverpool,
one of the two venues where Tiger
has previously hoisted the Claret Jug.
His emotional 2006 victory on the
course was his fust major win follow
ing the death of his father.
Finally the major season ends
with a return to Valhalla in Louisville,
Ky. where Tiger famously defeated
