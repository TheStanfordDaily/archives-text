# CARDINAL DOWNS DONS
## 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
A resurgent opening-day
starter and two three-run innings
at the plate lifted Stanford (4-4) to
a 6-4 victory over the University
of San Francisco Dons (3-5) on
Tuesday night at Sunken Dia
mond.

Perhaps in an attempt to build
the freshman's confidence, head
coach Mark Marquess started
freshman pitcher Cal Quantrill in
the game, despite his having
thrown 64 pitches on Friday at
Texas. The move paid off, as
Quantrill looked much more like
the Friday-night ace Stanford ex
pected him to be. Quantrill al
lowed just one hit over three
scoreless innings and was credited
with the first win of his collegiate
career.

"I wanted to give him some
more work," Marquess said. "He
only threw 60 pitches on Friday.
We're going to move him back and
start him Sunday. I just wanted to
get him back out there again."
The Cardinal jumped out to a
3-0 lead in the first inning thanks
to a two-run double down the left
field line from junior third base

man Alex Blandino. He later came
around to score on freshman Alex
Dunlap's two-out single. Blandino,
who extended his hitting streak to
eight games and is now hitting
.429 on the season, went 2-for-4
with two doubles and two RBIs.
Quantrill proceeded to work
quickly through the first three in
nings, throwing only 40 pitches
and allowing only two base run
ners. Both teams went down
quickly in the fourth, with senior
pitcher A.J. Vanegas making his
first appearance of the year in an
inning of scoreless relief for the
Cardinal.
"I thought we played well,"
Marquess said. "We threw a lot
more strikes. We had walked a lot
of people in the Texas series, but I
thought we threw a lot more
strikes and played good defense.
And we had some timely hitting
a couple of two-out hits to score
some runs."
In the fifth, the Card capital
ized on that timely hitting by pick
ing up three consecutive RBI hits
with two outs on the inning to
push the lead to 6-0. Senior Brett
Michael Doran, who went 3-for-3
in the game and is now hitting a
team-high .522 on the season,
started things with an RBI dou
ble, scoring junior Austin Slater,
who had reached with a single.

Senior Brett Michael Doran (above) went 3-for-3 with an RBI last
night in Stanford's 6-4 win over the University of San Francisco. This
season, he leads the team with a .522 AVG and a 1.403 OPS.
Taylor doubled to bring Do
ran home and freshman Alex
Dunlap singled to score Tay

Although the Dons re
sponded with three runs off
sophomore Logan James in
the top of the sixth, the rest
of the game proceeded
rather quietly, with sopho
more reliever Marcus
Brakeman again contribut
ing another solid perform
ance. Brakeman entered in

relief with two outs in the
sixth inning and did not al
low a base runner over 2.1
innings. Brakeman contin
ues to be one of the bright
spots in the early season for
the Cardinal, having allowed
only one ran over 7.1 innings
on the season.
Freshman pitcher Tyler
Thorne, who started last
Tuesday's game but was not
given the starting nod this
time around, entered to close
the game out in the ninth.
Thorne recorded two quick
outs before allowing a walk
and two hits that pushed one
more run across for the
Dons, making the score 6-4.

Thorne then forced a ground
out to end the game and pick
up the win for Stanford.
The win moved the Car
dinal back to .500 in an im
portant early-season contest
sandwiched between two dif
ficult series. Stanford will
now head to Nashville,
Tenn., to face the No. 4 Van
derbilt Commodores this
weekend.
"It will be another really
good test for us to see how
we match up against one of
the better teams in the coun
try," Marquess said.
