# Gaffney runs ahead of Pac

### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
Just a few months ago, senior
running back Tyler Gaffney was
pummeling his way to earning
hard-earned yards against some
of the most physical defensive
fronts in the Pac-12, earning a
reputation as a hard-nosed, stur
dy back. At the 2014 NFL Com
bine over the weekend, however,
the two-sport star turned quite a
few heads around the country
when he showed an ability to be
fast and mobile in addition to his
established skillset as a power
back.

Granted, Gaffney's speed and
mobility shouldn't come as too
much of a surprise â€”he was a
star outfielder for the Cardinal
baseball team and manned the
outfield in the Pittsburgh Pirates'
minor league system in his year
off from football, after all. Even
so, it came as a shock to many
around the nation when the San
Diego native outpaced Oregon
speedster De' Anthony Thomas in
the 40-yard dash with his time of
4.49 which tied him with Wash
ington's Bishop Sankey for the
fastest mark amongst Pae-12 run
ning backs at the combine.
In addition to showing off his
speed, Gaffney highlighted his mo
bility and agility with fantastic
showings in both the three-cone
drill and the 60-yard shuttle. In the

three-cone drill, which primarily
tests change-of-direction ability
coupled with speed, Gaffney's time
of 6.78 was second among all run
ning backs that attended the com
bine, while his 11.36 in the 60-yard
shuttle testing lateral mobility
was the best among all of the
running backs by a wide margin.
Although the Pittsburgh Pi
rates had extended an invitation
to Gaffney when he left the team
to return to their organization af
ter he finished with football,
Gaffney's strong showing at the
combine likely did nothing but im
prove his stock in the upcoming
2014 NFL Draft. It likely could
help him realize a career in pro
fessional football that will provide
him with multiple options moving
forward.
Gaffney's counterpart in the
backfield, fullback Ryan Hewitt,
attended the combine as a running
back and showcased his strong
movement skills with a top-10
showing in the three-cone drill and
a top-20 showing in the 20-yard
shuttle. As a fullback that was pre
dominantly a blocker instead of a
runner during his senior year, his
agility that was emphasized in a
field of standout running backs
will likely work in his favor, as his
size and strength coupled with his
