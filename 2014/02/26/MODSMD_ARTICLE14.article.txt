# Card out to defend Fac- 12 title
## 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
The No. 1 Cardinal women's
swimming team (10-0) has torn
through its dual-meet season, beat
ing all but two of its opponents by
margins greater than 30 points.
Heading into this week's Pac-12
Championships, Stanford knows
that the conference meet provides
a different challenge in settings
both more formal and more com
petitive than those of the duals.
However, an experienced Cardinal
squad enters the competition pre
pared to defend its 2013 title.
Stanford's veteran corps of sen
iors swimmers Felicia Lee,
Maya Dißado and Andie Taylor
and diver Stephanie Phipps
have contributed some of the best
performances in the country this
year and will look to draw upon
their experience in championship
meets of years past to lead the Car
dinal to a second straight confer
ence crown.

At last year's Pac-12 Champi
onships, Phipps won the conference
title in the 3-meter dive, while Di-
Rado and Lee both contributed to
an 800-yard freestyle relay victory.
In addition, Dißado won the 400-
yard individual medley (IM) and
placed in second in the 200-yard
backstroke. Lee and Taylor both al
so contributed third-place individ
ual finishes at last year's meet.
This year, Lee has been an ab

solute force in the pool, having won
every dual-meet event that she has
competed in since an Oct. 3 meet
against Washington State. That in
cludes four events in a solid 167-133
victory over the then-No. 1 Califor
nia Golden Bears to wrap up the
dual-meet season.
Dißado has also been consis
tently strong in her last season on
the Farm; her 200-yard IM time of
1:53.50 is the second-fastest time in
the country this season.
In addition, junior Maddy
Schaefer and freshman Lia Neal
will also look to make big splashes
for the Cardinal. Schaefer has qui
etly become one of the best sprint
ers in the country, and is tied with
Margo Geer of Arizona for the top
50-yard freestyle time in the con

ference with her mark of 21.78.
Meanwhile, Neal, an Olympic
bronze medalist, has also emerged
as one of the Cardinal's premier
forces this season. Her 100-yard
freestyle time of 47.48 has clocked
in at fourth in the nation thus far
this year, and her 200-yard
freestyle time of 1:43.86 has been
good enough for fifth in the coun
try. The catch? The three swim
mers ahead of her in the 100-yard
freestyle all swim for Pac-12
squads and will be swimming
against her at these championship
meets.
The conference teams that the
Cardinal will compete against this
weekend will undoubtedly consti
tute a challenging field to navigate.
That field includes three other top

15 teams in No. 2 USC, No. 5 Cal
and No. 11 Arizona, which all figure
to be strong in the championship
meet setting particularly Cal,
led by four-time Olympic gold
medalist Missy Franklin, who easi
ly won each of her individual events
in the Big Swim against Stanford.
USC also fields one of the deepest
teams in the country and will be led
by three reigning Pac-12 individual
champions.
The Cardinal will look to ride
the momentum from its perfect
dual-meet season to another con
ference title starting today in Fed
eral Way, Wash. The championships
will conclude on Saturday.
