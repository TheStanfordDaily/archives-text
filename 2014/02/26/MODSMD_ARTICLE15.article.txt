## SEEING GREEN Ecological Opportunity in the Modern "Homogocene"

S teller's sea cow. The dodo.
Passenger pigeons.
These are names many of us
have heard. They're part of a sad
list, now dozens of species long, of
animals that human activity has
driven extinct in recent history.
Many other members of this list
the quagga; the Tasmanian tiger;
the golden toad are less well
known, either because they lacked
the charisma to become the stuff of
legend, or because they have al
ready faded from our collective
memories.
Hundreds of other plants and
animals perch precariously on oth
er lists. They are "endangered,"
"red-listed," "threatened": all in all,
they're likely to go extinct soon
enough, leaving behind only photos,
videos and perhaps a test tube of
DNA in the back of a conservation
biologist's freezer.
Extinction events themselves
are hardly a rarity: almost all
species that have lived on Earth
have gone extinct. As the world
changes and new species evolve,
some of these species invariably fall
behind in the race of natural selec
tion. Evidence from the fossil
record suggests that, on average, 1-
5 species go extinct each year. But
sometimes, extinction rates spike,
with many hundreds, or even thou
sands, of species dying out at once.
Today, these extinctions are hap
pening at an unprecedented rate.
We call synchronized events
"mass extinctions." From what we
can learn of the fossil record, there
have been at least five mass extinc
tions in Earth's history. The most
recent occurred 65 million years
ago and wiped out the dinosaurs.
Each of these events occurred long
before our species evolved. We have
no idea what these mass extinctions
were like, what caused them and
what their effects were on the liv
ing ecosystems at the time.
But now, we're about to find out.
We are in the midst of the sixth
mass extinction and this time,
we know the cause: human activity.
The human population is boom
ing. In the time it takes you to read
this column (say, fifteen minutes)
3,500 babies will have been born.
Today, the global population stands
at 7.2 billion, and growing.
As our population grows, so too
does our impact on the planet. We
each need space to live and work,
farmland to grow our food and
maybe even some room to play. The
amount of technology that we use
affects the scale of these impacts:
Picture the difference between a
city and a village, or between an in
dustrial-strength farming opera
tion and a small, carbon-neutral
vineyard.
Today, our impact on the planet
has become so profound that it will
be recorded in the geological
record. Scientists call this time pe
riod the "Anthropocene," the time
in which human activity has be
come a driving force in nature, af
fecting everything from the carbon
cycle to the climate.
Not only are we dramatically

changing the planet, we are also ho
mogenizing it which is why, in
the last few years, a new term has
come into vogue: "Homogocene."
From the way we construct our
homes, to our preference for a few
key food crops, to our ability to
transport goods (and inadvertent
hangers-on) around the world in a
matter of hours, we are turning the
planet into a giant human play
ground.
On the one hand, this is neces
sary. For example, we cannot hope
to feed 7 billion people without
high-intensity agriculture. But on
the other hand, our doing so has se
vere consequences for other life on
the planet. Many, many species that
cannot survive in human-dominat
ed landscapes will be increasingly
squeezed into tiny scraps of "pre
served" land. Most are unlikely to
survive this transition and it's
the start of these extinctions that
have catapulted us into the sixth
mass extinction.
But this story is not entirely a
tragedy. Yes, some charismatic and
cuddly mammals may go, literally,
"the way of the dodo." But plenty of
species will thrive in the ecological
opportunities created by the Ho
mogocene.
For example, we'd be hard
pressed to find a better success sto
ry than the corn plant, once a hum
ble grass that now covers 30 per
cent of American farmland. And
many of our most despised "pest"
species are only known as such be
cause they're thriving in man-made
environments. House mice, cock
roaches, even dandelions and deer:
these species have found ways to
make a living in and around human
habitation.
Meanwhile, evolution carries on,
providing living organisms with the
chance to adapt to human-dominat
ed systems. Fbom bacteria that can
consume oil to fungi that can de
grade plastic, we will continue to
observe new life forms and pat
terns shaped by our influence.
Historically, mass extinctions of
ten precede explosions of diversifi
cation, as the surviving organisms
spread out to fill in the gaps. (For
example, the dino die-off likely
made room for our mammalian an
cestors to spread, diversify and
eventually give rise to us.) What
will follow the sixth mass extinction
remains to be seen.
