## The
						False Promise of Entrepreneurship 
### 
On Monday, The Daily pub
lished an opinion column
about entrepreneurship that I
felt captured much of what's wrong
about the way that Stanford and
many of its students are currently
thinking about undergraduate edu
cation. I reacted swiftly and angrily
on Facebook, so I want to take some
time here to discuss more extensive
ly how Stanford's intense focus on
entrepreneurship and startup cul
ture distracts from real problems
and stifles real meaning.

Old folk like me will doubtless re
member the ASSU Executive elec
tion of three years past, which gave
us the audacious and ambitious Stan
ford 2.0 platform that advertised
"student government as social entre
preneurship." The campaign website
was slickly designed and stuffed with
promises that this new approach
would revolutionize student life, and
the voters said yes please. On August
26, 2011, nearly a month before fall
quarter began, the new ASSU sent
out an email proclaiming itself "The

World's Most Effective & Innovative
Student Government."
According to their so-called
"Checklist 2.0," this ragtag team of
entrepreneurs accomplished no
more or no less than your average,
old-fashioned ASSU Executives.
Premised on the prospect of future
value, Stanford 2.0 perfectly encap
sulated what entrepreneurial ven
tures so often come to: aggressive
branding with little to no worthwhile
substance.
We see that word, entrepre
neurship, all the time, in the flyers
lining our bathroom stalls and in the
emails that StarfX inexplicably has
permission to send to the entire
campus. We even had an entire
dorm devoted to it last year, the
eDorm in Suites. Yet the more e's we
add to building names and drop
from app names, the more the word
simply becomes shorthand for a fast
track to a million dollars.
Or a billion dollars. Or three bil
lion. Or 19 billion. It is no longer a
secret that the primary goal of en

trepreneurship and startup culture
is not to build anything new but to
catch the attention and cash flow of
Facebook, Google, Twitter, Apple,
Linkedln or any of those other
companies that populate Silicon
Valley.
As I said in my initial reaction on
Facebook, there is nothing wrong
with this kind of entrepreneurship,
but there's also nothing right about
it. The startups that have arisen in
recent years, from Snapchat to Do
or Dash to Shoutt to RacoonVille,
are focused entirely on making mon
ey from previously untapped mar
kets. They contribute essentially
nothing to technological innovation:
They may make our lives easier, but
hardly in groundbreaking ways. I
haven't seen any evidence that the
value that these startups do add to
the world substantially benefits
anybody other than their employ
ees and shareholders.
Stanford invests in startups,
