# OP-ED
## The 						False Promise of Entrepreneurship 
### 
On Monday, The Daily pub
lished an opinion column
about entrepreneurship that I
felt captured much of what's wrong
about the way that Stanford and
many of its students are currently
thinking about undergraduate edu
cation. I reacted swiftly and angrily
on Facebook, so I want to take some
time here to discuss more extensive
ly how Stanford's intense focus on
entrepreneurship and startup cul
ture distracts from real problems
and stifles real meaning.

Old folk like me will doubtless re
member the ASSU Executive elec
tion of three years past, which gave
us the audacious and ambitious Stan
ford 2.0 platform that advertised
"student government as social entre
preneurship." The campaign website
was slickly designed and stuffed with
promises that this new approach
would revolutionize student life, and
the voters said yes please. On August
26, 2011, nearly a month before fall
quarter began, the new ASSU sent
out an email proclaiming itself "The

World's Most Effective & Innovative
Student Government."
According to their so-called
"Checklist 2.0," this ragtag team of
entrepreneurs accomplished no
more or no less than your average,
old-fashioned ASSU Executives.
Premised on the prospect of future
value, Stanford 2.0 perfectly encap
sulated what entrepreneurial ven
tures so often come to: aggressive
branding with little to no worthwhile
substance.
We see that word, entrepre
neurship, all the time, in the flyers
lining our bathroom stalls and in the
emails that StarfX inexplicably has
permission to send to the entire
campus. We even had an entire
dorm devoted to it last year, the
eDorm in Suites. Yet the more e's we
add to building names and drop
from app names, the more the word
simply becomes shorthand for a fast
track to a million dollars.
Or a billion dollars. Or three bil
lion. Or 19 billion. It is no longer a
secret that the primary goal of en

trepreneurship and startup culture
is not to build anything new but to
catch the attention and cash flow of
Facebook, Google, Twitter, Apple,
Linkedln or any of those other
companies that populate Silicon
Valley.
As I said in my initial reaction on
Facebook, there is nothing wrong
with this kind of entrepreneurship,
but there's also nothing right about
it. The startups that have arisen in
recent years, from Snapchat to Do
or Dash to Shoutt to RacoonVille,
are focused entirely on making mon
ey from previously untapped mar
kets. They contribute essentially
nothing to technological innovation:
They may make our lives easier, but
hardly in groundbreaking ways. I
haven't seen any evidence that the
value that these startups do add to
the world substantially benefits
anybody other than their employ
ees and shareholders.
Stanford invests in startups,
provides many others with
the initial technological re
sources necessary to get their
businesses off the ground and
celebrates startup culture as
alumni donations start flowing
in. Naturally, the path of en
trepreneurship is understand
ably attractive to many Stan
ford students. Although it can
be a high-risk path, Stanford
provides so much support and
backup that it almost seems
foolish not to follow it.
This is the false promise of
entrepreneurship that
through money we can find
meaning. Entrepreneurship
measures success in dollar's
earned, not in stomachs fed or
lives enriched. It conflates life
goals with business bench
marks and purposeful dia
logue with focus-grouped
branding. Money will perpetu
ally dominate our conversa
tions, but too often at Stanford
we talk about those who al
ready have money while ig
noring those who do not have
enough.
We should be better than
that, and in many ways we
are. During my time at Stan
ford, I have met scores of
people who inspire and as
tound me. These are the peo
ple who take weekly Mar
guerite rides to volunteer in
East Palo Alto, who fight to
keep a homeless shelter open
downtown and who commit
to teaching in underserved
communities. Beyond the
realm of public service, I
know artists who aspire to
create and entertain, future
doctors who aspire to re
search new drugs and vac
cines and, yes, computer sci

entists who aspire to build
technologies that make our
government more efficient
and our world more secure.
I have to believe that we
all enter Stanford with the
passionate search for greater
meaning ablaze within us.
But as the senior class ap
proaches graduation, I can
see that this flame has begun
to flicker. For some, it's al
ready out. Personally, mine is
burning dimly, suffocated by
anxiety, self-doubt and resig
nation to the economic reali
ties of the world outside the
Stanford Bubble.
There must be away for
Stanford to help us hold on to
that passion the same pas
sion that Stanford's gate
keepers lauded when they let
us in. If Stanford is to take
seriously its majors in the hu
manities, social sciences and
natural sciences, then it must
actively combat that end-of
college feeling that choosing
those majors was a mistake.
Opportunities for a well-paid
and relevant first job do ex
ist, but they are fiercely com
petitive and woefully finite.
Otherwise, the next
"best" option is money-driv
en entrepreneurship. The al
lure is intoxicating that's
why I voted for Stanford 2.0
three years ago. Maybe it's
not such a bad thing to live
comfortably in Silicon Valley
pushing the limits of econom
ic sanity. Maybe that's the di
rection that Stanford wants
to take into the future. But if
that's the case, then it's not
the Stanford I want to attend
anymore. It's certainly not
the Stanford we were prom
ised.
