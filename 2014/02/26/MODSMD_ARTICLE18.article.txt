# Fadi Quran: Stanford's Palestinian Freedom Rider
## 
### Kristian Bailey 
This is the second piece in a
three-part series on life in
Palestine and Israel.
This week marks two years since
Stanford alumnus Fadi Quran was
arrested, beaten and detained in the
West Bank. Video of Fadi's treat
ment set off a flurry of campus and
international attention, after ten
Israeli soldiers claimed Fadi had
assaulted them. Fadi, who graduat
ed in 2010 with degrees in physics
and international relations, had
joined protests in Hebron to open
Shuhada Street, a central road in
the West Bank's largest city. The
Israeli military has closed the
street to Palestinians since 2000 in
order to "protect" the couple hun
dred settlers occupying land in the
city.
Fadi's activism in the region is
rich: he is one of six Palestinian
freedom riders arrested while at
tempting to desegregate Israeli
only buses in the West Bank and
was named "the face of the new
Middle East" by Time Magazine.
The trajectory of my life as a

Stanford student, as a journalist
and my development into an ac
tivist was profoundly affected
by covering Fadi's arrest for The
Stanford Daily as a news reporter.
I did a 40-minute post-prison inter
view with Fadi which I only pub
lished on my website at the time.
The remainder of my column today
features excerpts from my inter
view with Fadi on March 2, 2012.
KDB: Can you give me some con
text about last Friday's demon
strations in Hebron?
FQ: What the protest was about
was a specific road that was the
main trade and market road in He
bron, called Shuhada Street. It
had most of the markets, it was
just the main road you can
think about it as like University
Avenue in Palo Alto, something
like that. And it was closed down
to Palestinians, all the stores, all
the Palestinian [word unclear]
shut down and Palestinians are not
allowed to use that street. And
those Palestinians who live on that

street are only allowed a small
patch on the side of the road to
walk to their homes. So the march
was a nonviolent march to try and
simply walk on this road to open
Shuhada Street for Palestinian
youth.
KDB: The spokesperson from the
Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs
said the protests on Friday were
unauthorized and therefore illegal.
Could you talk a little bit more
about that?
FQ: So basically, under Israeli mili
tary law, there's Military Order
Number 101. What Military Order
Number 101 says is that any type of
gathering of more than 10 Pales
tinians to discuss political or cultur
al issues is illegal under their mili
tary law, and could be punished by
years in prison and fines, and so
forth...
Yes, so you need to ask authori
zation. But of course, it's like saying
that the protesters in South Africa
shouldn't have protested or
marched without getting authoriza
tion from the apartheid regime. It's
similar to saying that the African-
Americans in the South shouldn't
have protested in Birmingham be
fore getting authorization from the
U.S. Army. It just doesn't make
sense. It's a racist policy it's a

dictatorial occupation it's an
apartheid regime. And of course no
type of protest or march towards
freedom or justice is going to be ac
cepted by them.
KDB: Can you give us an account
of your prison experiences?
FQ: They put me in a room alone
that had basically throw up and fe
ces on the ground, and so forth.
And I got there at 3 a.m. they
strip-searched me, and I then, as I
was about to fall asleep I still
couldn't see of course from the pep
per spray I could barely open
my eyes.
At 5:30 a.m., after basically sit
ting in the room with bright lights
on for an hour, an hour and a half,
one of the soldiers walks in and
says, basically begins to ... me and
asks me to clean up, to clean up the
room ... Eventually he was saying,
'lf you don't clean the room, we're
going to clean the room with you.'
And I said therefore, to avoid
more trouble, I cleaned the room
and the nearby bathroom with my
blanket that was in the room and I
had to sleep essentially cold. They
kept me in that room alone without
anyone with me for 24 hours in soli
tary confinement. And I didn't
know what time it was and the
room didn't have any windows and

the bright lights stayed on they
never closed them.
KDB: Do you have any messages
for the Stanford community?
FQ: I'm very grateful to the Stan
ford community and to the interna
tional community for supporting
me the way they did I would
have likely been in prison for much
longer had they not mobilized their
support so quickly. And I pray that
everyone has a similar community
that everyone will have a similar
community that could protect them
in times of need like the Stanford
community did for me. But there
are hundreds of similar cases, if
not more, and they deserve just as
much help as I did and even
more.
KDB: What is the current state of
your activism?
FQ: We're informally organized in
to different groups who come to
gether for specific events ... differ
ent groups from different loca
tions. And we work for freedom,
justice and nonviolent activism,
similar to the type of activism that
was used by the African National
Congress in South Africa and by
the Civil Rights Movement in the
U.S. and by Gandhi. Our
movement is growing and
clearly, like I noticed while I
was in prison, the Israeli mili
tary and the Israeli govern
ment understand that we
could be a powerful force for
change towards freedom,
justice and liberty for all.

This is the second piece in a
three-part series on life in
Palestine and Israel.
This week marks two years since
Stanford alumnus Fadi Quran was
arrested, beaten and detained in the
West Bank. Video of Fadi's treat
ment set off a flurry of campus and
international attention, after ten
Israeli soldiers claimed Fadi had
assaulted them. Fadi, who graduat
ed in 2010 with degrees in physics
and international relations, had
joined protests in Hebron to open
Shuhada Street, a central road in
the West Bank's largest city. The
Israeli military has closed the
street to Palestinians since 2000 in
order to "protect" the couple hun
dred settlers occupying land in the
city.
Fadi's activism in the region is
rich: he is one of six Palestinian
freedom riders arrested while at
tempting to desegregate Israeli
only buses in the West Bank and
was named "the face of the new
Middle East" by Time Magazine.
The trajectory of my life as a

Stanford student, as a journalist
and my development into an ac
tivist was profoundly affected
by covering Fadi's arrest for The
Stanford Daily as a news reporter.
I did a 40-minute post-prison inter
view with Fadi which I only pub
lished on my website at the time.
The remainder of my column today
features excerpts from my inter
view with Fadi on March 2, 2012.
KDB: Can you give me some con
text about last Friday's demon
strations in Hebron?
FQ: What the protest was about
was a specific road that was the
main trade and market road in He
bron, called Shuhada Street. It
had most of the markets, it was
just the main road you can
think about it as like University
Avenue in Palo Alto, something
like that. And it was closed down
to Palestinians, all the stores, all
the Palestinian [word unclear]
shut down and Palestinians are not
allowed to use that street. And
those Palestinians who live on that

street are only allowed a small
patch on the side of the road to
walk to their homes. So the march
was a nonviolent march to try and
simply walk on this road to open
Shuhada Street for Palestinian
youth.
KDB: The spokesperson from the
Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs
said the protests on Friday were
unauthorized and therefore illegal.
Could you talk a little bit more
about that?
FQ: So basically, under Israeli mili
tary law, there's Military Order
Number 101. What Military Order
Number 101 says is that any type of
gathering of more than 10 Pales
tinians to discuss political or cultur
al issues is illegal under their mili
tary law, and could be punished by
years in prison and fines, and so
forth...
Yes, so you need to ask authori
zation. But of course, it's like saying
that the protesters in South Africa
shouldn't have protested or
marched without getting authoriza
tion from the apartheid regime. It's
similar to saying that the African-
Americans in the South shouldn't
have protested in Birmingham be
fore getting authorization from the
U.S. Army. It just doesn't make
sense. It's a racist policy it's a

dictatorial occupation it's an
apartheid regime. And of course no
type of protest or march towards
freedom or justice is going to be ac
cepted by them.
KDB: Can you give us an account
of your prison experiences?
FQ: They put me in a room alone
that had basically throw up and fe
ces on the ground, and so forth.
And I got there at 3 a.m. they
strip-searched me, and I then, as I
was about to fall asleep I still
couldn't see of course from the pep
per spray I could barely open
my eyes.
At 5:30 a.m., after basically sit
ting in the room with bright lights
on for an hour, an hour and a half,
one of the soldiers walks in and
says, basically begins to ... me and
asks me to clean up, to clean up the
room ... Eventually he was saying,
'lf you don't clean the room, we're
going to clean the room with you.'
And I said therefore, to avoid
more trouble, I cleaned the room
and the nearby bathroom with my
blanket that was in the room and I
had to sleep essentially cold. They
kept me in that room alone without
anyone with me for 24 hours in soli
tary confinement. And I didn't
know what time it was and the
room didn't have any windows and

the bright lights stayed on they
never closed them.
KDB: Do you have any messages
for the Stanford community?
FQ: I'm very grateful to the Stan
ford community and to the interna
tional community for supporting
me the way they did I would
have likely been in prison for much
longer had they not mobilized their
support so quickly. And I pray that
everyone has a similar community
that everyone will have a similar
community that could protect them
in times of need like the Stanford
community did for me. But there
are hundreds of similar cases, if
not more, and they deserve just as
much help as I did and even
more.
KDB: What is the current state of
your activism?
FQ: We're informally organized in
to different groups who come to
gether for specific events ... differ
ent groups from different loca
tions. And we work for freedom,
justice and nonviolent activism,
similar to the type of activism that
was used by the African National
Congress in South Africa and by
the Civil Rights Movement in the
U.S. and by Gandhi. Our
movement is growing and
clearly, like I noticed while I
was in prison, the Israeli mili
tary and the Israeli govern
ment understand that we
could be a powerful force for
change towards freedom,
justice and liberty for all.
