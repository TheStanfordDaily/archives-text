## Christine Lagarde discusses the world economy 
### FELIX BOYEAUX CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Christine Lagarde, managing
director of the International Mone
tary Fund (IMF), addressed a
packed Bechtel Conference Room
in Encina Hall on Tuesday, in a talk
that focused on the current state of
the world economy and global inno
vation and interconnections.

Lagarde had recently flown in
from the G-20 summit in Sydney,
Australia, during which the finan
cial leaders of the world's 20 largest
economies had agreed to complete

core financial reforms in order to
mitigate the risk of another global
financial crisis.

Lagarde herself expressed am
bivalence about the current global
economic performance.
"While unemployment and pub
lic and private debt is still too high,
and global growth is still too low, we
certainly see some economic mo
mentum in the works, with global
economic growth of 3.75 percent
this year, rising to four percent next
year," she said.
However, this growth, largely
due to positive advancements in the

United States economy, has led to
the tapering of quantitative easing,
the Federal Reserve's unconven
tional asset purchasing scheme.
"For emerging markets, [...] a
rising tide came with more choppy
waves," she said, pointing to the
fact that weakening economies
along with asset-purchase tapering
prompted capital flight from
emerging markets, generating
market volatility and currency vari
ations.
