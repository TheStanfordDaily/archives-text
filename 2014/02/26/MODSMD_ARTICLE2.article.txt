## Christine Lagarde discusses the world economy 
### FELIX BOYEAUX CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Christine Lagarde, managing
director of the International Mone
tary Fund (IMF), addressed a
packed Bechtel Conference Room
in Encina Hall on Tuesday, in a talk
that focused on the current state of
the world economy and global inno
vation and interconnections.

Lagarde had recently flown in
from the G-20 summit in Sydney,
Australia, during which the finan
cial leaders of the world's 20 largest
economies had agreed to complete

core financial reforms in order to
mitigate the risk of another global
financial crisis.

Lagarde herself expressed am
bivalence about the current global
economic performance.
"While unemployment and pub
lic and private debt is still too high,
and global growth is still too low, we
certainly see some economic mo
mentum in the works, with global
economic growth of 3.75 percent
this year, rising to four percent next
year," she said.
However, this growth, largely
due to positive advancements in the

United States economy, has led to
the tapering of quantitative easing,
the Federal Reserve's unconven
tional asset purchasing scheme.
"For emerging markets, [...] a
rising tide came with more choppy
waves," she said, pointing to the
fact that weakening economies
along with asset-purchase tapering
prompted capital flight from
emerging markets, generating
market volatility and currency vari
ations.

Christine Lagarde, recently arrived from the G-20 summit in Sydney, Australia,
spoke to students about current global economic performance and
encouraged technological learning at college campuses like Stanford.
Stanford's role in promoting
technological learning and
spurring innovation, assert
ing that students need to rec
ognize the role that they play
in driving progress.
"If the previous [econom
ic] revolutions were about us
ing machines for brawn, this
one is about using machines
for brains," she said, pointing
out that science fiction is rap
idly becoming "science fact."
Lagarde noted that de
spite unprecedented levels of
innovation, technology has
led to growing concerns
about rising inequality.
"The bottom half of the
world's population owns the
same as the richest 85 people
in the world," Lagarde, citing
figures from Oxfam Interna
tional.
She suggested that Stan
ford is, and should continue
to be, at the forefront of the
fight against inequality.
"I know that these con
cerns resonate strongly at
this university, which was
founded to use the words
of Jane Stanford â€”with a
'spirit of equality,"' she said.
In Lagarde's mind, allevi
ating this inequality starts
with education.
"Fundamentally, we need
to change what people learn,
how people learn, when peo
ple learn and even why peo

ple learn," she said. "We
must get beyond the tradi
tional model of students sit
ting passively in classrooms."
In an interview with The
Daily after her talk, she
urged Stanford to help de
mocratize the "bridge" that
education provides.
"Given where it is located
and given the density of inno
vation in Stanford's ecosys
tem, I am sure that it will use
some of the tools, be it e
learning or e-teaching, to
propagate the learning, re
search and work that is being
done here at Stanford," La
garde said.
According to Lagarde,
the private sector should
communicate more openly
about what its scenarios for
the future are, and what its
strategies will be, in order to
help educational institutions
actually adapt to that mar
ket.
"It is only through that di
alogue that we can ensure
that education really is a
bridge between today's and
tomorrow's economy," she
said. "This is a great test of
our time, and I know that the
Stanford community is intri
cately linked to the develop
ments that will shape out fu
ture."
The event was co-spon
sored by the Freeman Spogli
Institute for International
Studies and the Stanford In
stitute for Economic Policy
Research.
