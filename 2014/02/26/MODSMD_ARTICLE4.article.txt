## Authors explore 'The Ghost Writer' 
### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
Another Look, a book club
founded by the English Depart
ment to discuss books deemed to
have not yet received their time in
the spotlight, took on Philip Roth's
'The Ghost Writer' on Tuesday
night.
Tobias Wolff M.A. '7B, profes
sor of English and director of An
other Look, moderated the discus
sion, which also featured writers
Ayelet Waldman and Michael
Chabon. Wolff said that he aimed
to give the book more attention.
'"The Ghost Writer' is one of
Roth's books that might have fall

en out of the range of serious read
ers when compared with some of
his greater monumental works,"
Wolff noted.
The 1979 novel tells the story
of Nathan Zuckerman, a young
writer who travels to a writer's
colony. There, he meets E.I.
Lonoff, one of his inspirations as a
writer, and Amy Bellette, a woman
living anonymously in the United
States after the Holocaust whom
Zuckerman suspects is Anne
Frank.
Panel members looked at ele
ments in Roth's lesser-known nov
el, ranging from the influences in
the book to the author's thoughts
about the writing process to the

reader's relationship to the work.
"There's an expectation as a
Jewish writer in terms of what's
going to be your Holocaust book,"
Waldman said. "[Roth]... ap
proaches this terrifying subject in
a masterful way."
Wolff also addressed Roth's
protests about being called a Jew
ish writer.
"People reading Roth under
stand that he's American and a
writer and a Jew, and that he
writes about these themes," Wolff
explained. "He's not being held in
a category."
