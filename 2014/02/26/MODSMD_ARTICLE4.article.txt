# SPEAKERS & EVENTS
## Authors explore 'The Ghost Writer' 
### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
Another Look, a book club
founded by the English Depart
ment to discuss books deemed to
have not yet received their time in
the spotlight, took on Philip Roth's
'The Ghost Writer' on Tuesday
night.
Tobias Wolff M.A. '7B, profes
sor of English and director of An
other Look, moderated the discus
sion, which also featured writers
Ayelet Waldman and Michael
Chabon. Wolff said that he aimed
to give the book more attention.
'"The Ghost Writer' is one of
Roth's books that might have fall

en out of the range of serious read
ers when compared with some of
his greater monumental works,"
Wolff noted.
The 1979 novel tells the story
of Nathan Zuckerman, a young
writer who travels to a writer's
colony. There, he meets E.I.
Lonoff, one of his inspirations as a
writer, and Amy Bellette, a woman
living anonymously in the United
States after the Holocaust whom
Zuckerman suspects is Anne
Frank.
Panel members looked at ele
ments in Roth's lesser-known nov
el, ranging from the influences in
the book to the author's thoughts
about the writing process to the

reader's relationship to the work.
"There's an expectation as a
Jewish writer in terms of what's
going to be your Holocaust book,"
Waldman said. "[Roth]... ap
proaches this terrifying subject in
a masterful way."
Wolff also addressed Roth's
protests about being called a Jew
ish writer.
"People reading Roth under
stand that he's American and a
writer and a Jew, and that he
writes about these themes," Wolff
explained. "He's not being held in
a category."
Waldman first read the novel
when she was a young girl, calling
the experience "magical."
"It was one of the first times I
noticed how people write and what
a writer's voice sounds like and
how different Roth's voice sounds
from the day-to-day or from other
writers," she said.

Chabon also spoke to Roth's in
fluence on his work. He found him
self relating to Zuckerman strong
ly when he first read the novel at
the age of 23 before starting his
Master of Fine Arts studies.
"I was the same age as Nathan
and identified with the sense of an
ticipation he has for the career he
hopes he'll have," he said. "I be
came so captivated by the possibil
ity that some life like what he antic
ipates might lie in store for me as
well."

The panel further explored the
way in which real life can intersect
with fiction, noting the similarities
between Zuekerman and Roth, and
between Roth and characters in his
other pieces of fiction.
"He almost always writes about
a man of his age, going through
similar experiences," Waldman
said. "But that's the joy of fiction.
You can take those real life experi
ences and then make stuff up and
mix it all together in this delightful
stew. You play the game on pur
pose."
For Waldman, reading this book
a second time in preparation for
this talk helped her remember
what it means to be a writer.
"I just told myself to get back to
work," she said. "I know what that
is: getting up in the morning and
sitting down at your desk and do
ing your work. When I finished my
last novel, it's like I forgot that, but
this book helped remind me what
my job is."
Wolff said that Another Look
aims to do just that —to refresh
interest in the books the club
chooses to spotlight.
"We talk about television shows
all the time," he said. "Why should
n't we talk about books in the same
way?"

similar experiences," Waldman
said. "But that's the joy of fiction.
You can take those real life experi
ences and then make stuff up and
mix it all together in this delightful
stew. You play the game on pur
pose."
For Waldman, reading this book
a second time in preparation for
this talk helped her remember
what it means to be a writer.
"I just told myself to get back to
work," she said. "I know what that
is: getting up in the morning and
sitting down at your desk and do
ing your work. When I finished my
last novel, it's like I forgot that, but
this book helped remind me what
my job is."
Wolff said that Another Look
aims to do just that —to refresh
interest in the books the club
chooses to spotlight.
"We talk about television shows
all the time," he said. "Why should
n't we talk about books in the same
way?"
