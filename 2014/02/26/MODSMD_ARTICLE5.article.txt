# Q&A GERHARD CASPER
## PRESIDENT OF STANFORD UNIVERSITY, 1992 TO 2000 
### NITISH KULKARNI DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Gerhard Casper served as the ninth President
of Stanford University from 1992 to 2000. Yester
day, he released a new book, "The Winds of Free
dom," that documents his time and experiences at
Stanford through eight key speeches. Casper sat
down with The Daily to discuss the book, his inspi
ration to write it and his time at Stanford.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): The year you became
president, 1992, was a tumultuous time for Stan
ford. What do you think were the biggest issues
facing Stanford then, and how was the University
different then from what it is today?
Gerhard Casper (GC): Indeed. The biggest is
sues were on the one hand, the so-called indirect

cost controversy
[which is] when
Stanford or any
other university
does research that
is financed by the
federal government
and the university
also recovers indi
rect cost overhead.
There was an
auditor at Stanford,
on campus, for the
Office of Naval Re
search, which is our
cognizant agency

for indirect cost purposes. The local auditor had
made allegations to his bosses back in Washington
that Stanford had played loose and fast with the
rules about indirect cost recovery. Now he also
brought against the University a qui tarn lawsuit,
where the plaintiff sues on behalf of the United
States government. It ended only in 1998 when the
Supreme Court refused to hear the case. If we had
lost that case, we'd have had an exposure of hun
dreds of millions of dollars.
Then there were issues that were more cultur
al. In 1989, the University had decided to adopt an
interpretation of the Fundamental Standard, and
it outlawed discriminatory harassment, fighting
words, face to face [harassment], for racial and
other reasons. It was, in away, a fairly limited rule,
but the politics of that time were very different be
cause many people criticized the University for
curtailing speech.
Finally, perhaps, another big issue that had got
ten a lot of attention in the national media, and a
lot of attention from Stanford alumni, was the

[changes in the] humanities
requirement in the [fresh
man] year.
TSD: What was the environ
ment on campus like then
compared to today?
GC: That's an interesting
question, and I often ask my
self that. The early '9os were
really marked on campuses
by what I might call identity
politics and multicultural
ism. There were various con
troversies where minorities
insisted recognition by the
universities qua their own
identity, and there were
some disputes, especially
with Chicano students, in
1994. There was a sit-in the
Main Quad, and a hunger
strike. These matters more

generally, of multicultural
ism, were where the issues
was not diversity as such,
but whether beyond that the
University should recognize
separate aspects of various
cultures represented.
TSD: When you talk about
these issues, were there cer
tain policy changes adopted
by the University in re
sponse?
GC: Yes, though if you
take a look at my book, you
will see that it is not so much
rules or policies, but my ef
forts to set a different tone.
There were certain points on
which I was very clear,
though. For instance, the
Chicano hunger strike,
which attracted support
from several hundred stu
dents at the time, they made
certain demands. We looked
at certain issues, but I re
jected out of hand what was
called the politics of ultima

turn it was very clear that
at least as long as I was pres
ident, I would not make con
cessions under pressure.
We also toughened aca
demic requirements at the
time —we introduced the
failing grade. Another major
change that came, and that I
worked on very much, did
not involve a rule change,
but rather we created the
freshman and sophomore
seminars, where every
freshman and sophomore
has the opportunity to take a
seminar with a faculty mem
ber limited to 14 students,
and that to me was very im
portant for the intellectual
environment.

TSD: What inspired you
write a book now? What was
the process like?
GC: In some ways, it was
very peculiar. Shortly after I
stepped down as president, I
thought it would be interest

ing to take my major speech
es and those dealing with ac
ademic freedom and talk
about what I really thought
and believed in, what moti
vated me to make these
speeches and what the con
text was.
Each chapter at first has
the text of the speech I
didn't include all of my
speeches in the book, since I
made over a thousand
speeches in eight years.
Each chapter has the text of
the speech, and then I ex
plain the content that it was
made in and discuss the sub
text. Sometimes I have also
added a postscript with re
lated matters, and I found
this format gave me a lot of
space to add other issues and
creativity that I might have
not linked to the original
speech.

ford. What do you think were the biggest issues
facing Stanford then, and how was the University
different then from what it is today?
Gerhard Casper (GC): Indeed. The biggest is
sues were on the one hand, the so-called indirect

cost controversy
[which is] when
Stanford or any
other university
does research that
is financed by the
federal government
and the university
also recovers indi
rect cost overhead.
There was an
auditor at Stanford,
on campus, for the
Office of Naval Re
search, which is our
cognizant agency

for indirect cost purposes. The local auditor had
made allegations to his bosses back in Washington
that Stanford had played loose and fast with the
rules about indirect cost recovery. Now he also
brought against the University a qui tarn lawsuit,
where the plaintiff sues on behalf of the United
States government. It ended only in 1998 when the
Supreme Court refused to hear the case. If we had
lost that case, we'd have had an exposure of hun
dreds of millions of dollars.
Then there were issues that were more cultur
al. In 1989, the University had decided to adopt an
interpretation of the Fundamental Standard, and
it outlawed discriminatory harassment, fighting
words, face to face [harassment], for racial and
other reasons. It was, in away, a fairly limited rule,
but the politics of that time were very different be
cause many people criticized the University for
curtailing speech.
Finally, perhaps, another big issue that had got
ten a lot of attention in the national media, and a
lot of attention from Stanford alumni, was the

[changes in the] humanities
requirement in the [fresh
man] year.
TSD: What was the environ
ment on campus like then
compared to today?
GC: That's an interesting
question, and I often ask my
self that. The early '9os were
really marked on campuses
by what I might call identity
politics and multicultural
ism. There were various con
troversies where minorities
insisted recognition by the
universities qua their own
identity, and there were
some disputes, especially
with Chicano students, in
1994. There was a sit-in the
Main Quad, and a hunger
strike. These matters more

generally, of multicultural
ism, were where the issues
was not diversity as such,
but whether beyond that the
University should recognize
separate aspects of various
cultures represented.
TSD: When you talk about
these issues, were there cer
tain policy changes adopted
by the University in re
sponse?
GC: Yes, though if you
take a look at my book, you
will see that it is not so much
rules or policies, but my ef
forts to set a different tone.
There were certain points on
which I was very clear,
though. For instance, the
Chicano hunger strike,
which attracted support
from several hundred stu
dents at the time, they made
certain demands. We looked
at certain issues, but I re
jected out of hand what was
called the politics of ultima

turn it was very clear that
at least as long as I was pres
ident, I would not make con
cessions under pressure.
We also toughened aca
demic requirements at the
time —we introduced the
failing grade. Another major
change that came, and that I
worked on very much, did
not involve a rule change,
but rather we created the
freshman and sophomore
seminars, where every
freshman and sophomore
has the opportunity to take a
seminar with a faculty mem
ber limited to 14 students,
and that to me was very im
portant for the intellectual
environment.

TSD: What inspired you
write a book now? What was
the process like?
GC: In some ways, it was
very peculiar. Shortly after I
stepped down as president, I
thought it would be interest

ing to take my major speech
es and those dealing with ac
ademic freedom and talk
about what I really thought
and believed in, what moti
vated me to make these
speeches and what the con
text was.
Each chapter at first has
the text of the speech I
didn't include all of my
speeches in the book, since I
made over a thousand
speeches in eight years.
Each chapter has the text of
the speech, and then I ex
plain the content that it was
made in and discuss the sub
text. Sometimes I have also
added a postscript with re
lated matters, and I found
this format gave me a lot of
space to add other issues and
creativity that I might have
not linked to the original
speech.
