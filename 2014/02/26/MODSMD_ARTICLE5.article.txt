# Q&A GERHARD CASPER
## PRESIDENT OF STANFORD UNIVERSITY, 1992 TO 2000 
### NITISH KULKARNI DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Gerhard Casper served as the ninth President
of Stanford University from 1992 to 2000. Yester
day, he released a new book, "The Winds of Free
dom," that documents his time and experiences at
Stanford through eight key speeches. Casper sat
down with The Daily to discuss the book, his inspi
ration to write it and his time at Stanford.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): The year you became
president, 1992, was a tumultuous time for Stan
ford. What do you think were the biggest issues
facing Stanford then, and how was the University
different then from what it is today?
Gerhard Casper (GC): Indeed. The biggest is
sues were on the one hand, the so-called indirect

cost controversy
[which is] when
Stanford or any
other university
does research that
is financed by the
federal government
and the university
also recovers indi
rect cost overhead.
There was an
auditor at Stanford,
on campus, for the
Office of Naval Re
search, which is our
cognizant agency

for indirect cost purposes. The local auditor had
made allegations to his bosses back in Washington
that Stanford had played loose and fast with the
rules about indirect cost recovery. Now he also
brought against the University a qui tarn lawsuit,
where the plaintiff sues on behalf of the United
States government. It ended only in 1998 when the
Supreme Court refused to hear the case. If we had
lost that case, we'd have had an exposure of hun
dreds of millions of dollars.
Then there were issues that were more cultur
al. In 1989, the University had decided to adopt an
interpretation of the Fundamental Standard, and
it outlawed discriminatory harassment, fighting
words, face to face [harassment], for racial and
other reasons. It was, in away, a fairly limited rule,
but the politics of that time were very different be
cause many people criticized the University for
curtailing speech.
Finally, perhaps, another big issue that had got
ten a lot of attention in the national media, and a
lot of attention from Stanford alumni, was the
