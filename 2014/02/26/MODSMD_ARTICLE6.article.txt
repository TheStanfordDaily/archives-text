## Camp Kesem grows from humble roots 
### HANNAH GRACE 
For almost 13 years, Stanford under
graduates have volunteered to organize
Camp Kesem, a yearly sleepover summer
camp for boys and girls aged six to 16 whose
parents have or have had cancer.
In Hebrew, kesem means "magic." For
the Stanford students that make Camp Ke
sem a possibility, that magic is found in the
community the camp nurtures.
"That magic comes from the people and
the people alone," said Ben Rosellini 'l5.

The camper experience
According to Ben McKenzie 'l5, a mem
ber of Kesem's leadership team, the camp
has two main purposes.
"We want to allow [the campers] to be

kids, and to show them they're not alone, to
take away the isolating aspect of a parent
who has cancer," McKenzie said.
Perhaps the most distinctive aspect of
the counseling experience is the nicknames
each counselor assumes for the duration of
their tenure.
"The names enable us to be our best
selves when we take on the name and the

persona behind that name," explained Scott
"Chimp" Swartz 'l4, co-chair of the coordi
nator team.
As with any other camp, Camp Kesem
features games, singing and nature hikes.
However, there are also structured times
when campers are given a safe space to

share their experiences about their
parents' cancer. For example, the
camp incorporates nightly "Cabin
Chats" as well as a ceremony called
"Roots," which gives everyone a
chance to talk about the impact can
cer has had on their lives.
"The 'Roots' ceremony marks an
incredible week of emotional shifts
and makes everything after that
even more special," said Alan Propp
'l6, who will return for his second
summer as a counselor this year.

Expanding Camp Kesem
Camp Kesem has grown quickly
from humble roots. Having started
as a small project of the Stanford
Hillel in 2001, the camp was initially
only able to accommodate 37
campers, according to camp direc
tor Heather Paul. After the camp
met with initial success, Hillel staff
member Iris Rave founded Camp
Kesem National in August 2002 in
order to help other college students
start similar programs.
Since then, Camp Kesem has
grown to encompass 53 other camps
hosted by different universities
across the country, including UC-
Berkeley, MIT, Yale and Northwest
ern.
Back at Stanford, the original
Camp Kesem has expanded and will
be at full capacity for this coming
summer, hosting 130 campers.
Despite experiencing maximum
enrollment, Stanford's chapter of
Kesem is currently focused on
growing in depth rather than
breadth, according to Paul, who
added that she is working on devel
oping an extensive program for
counselor alumni that would allow
them to stay involved even after
graduation from Stanford.
That additional depth may also

include more support for campers
throughout the year. Reunions in
the fall and spring have allowed
campers to stay involved with Ke
sem. Meanwhile, staying updated
with families' situations when they
are away from camp gives coun
selors the chance to support
campers beyond the one-week
camp.

"I get the best camper emails,"
Paul said. "I love them. They make
me so happy."
When the camp is not in session,
the student leadership must devote
a significant amount of time to rais
ing funds to support the camp's abil
ity to not charge campers. Over the
academic year, two coordinators
work on funding from grants and in
dividual ask letters.
Kesem also holds smaller
fundraisers with other community
organizations, like Treehouse, Pizza
My Heart, Stanford Hair and the
Athlete Date Auction. Sixty percent
of Kesem's funding, however, comes
from private donors.
Ultimately, the counselors em
phasized their desire to be a part of
a community like none other.
"To see so many people who are
so talented and knowledgeable give
all of their resources to such a noble
cause is so inspiring," McKenzie
said.

"It's amazing to have the chance
to contribute to the [kids'] happi
ness and well-being and to be a sup
port network for them to rely on,"
Rosellini said.

For almost 13 years, Stanford under
graduates have volunteered to organize
Camp Kesem, a yearly sleepover summer
camp for boys and girls aged six to 16 whose
parents have or have had cancer.
In Hebrew, kesem means "magic." For
the Stanford students that make Camp Ke
sem a possibility, that magic is found in the
community the camp nurtures.
"That magic comes from the people and
the people alone," said Ben Rosellini 'l5.

The camper experience
According to Ben McKenzie 'l5, a mem
ber of Kesem's leadership team, the camp
has two main purposes.
"We want to allow [the campers] to be

kids, and to show them they're not alone, to
take away the isolating aspect of a parent
who has cancer," McKenzie said.
Perhaps the most distinctive aspect of
the counseling experience is the nicknames
each counselor assumes for the duration of
their tenure.
"The names enable us to be our best
selves when we take on the name and the

persona behind that name," explained Scott
"Chimp" Swartz 'l4, co-chair of the coordi
nator team.
As with any other camp, Camp Kesem
features games, singing and nature hikes.
However, there are also structured times
when campers are given a safe space to

share their experiences about their
parents' cancer. For example, the
camp incorporates nightly "Cabin
Chats" as well as a ceremony called
"Roots," which gives everyone a
chance to talk about the impact can
cer has had on their lives.
"The 'Roots' ceremony marks an
incredible week of emotional shifts
and makes everything after that
even more special," said Alan Propp
'l6, who will return for his second
summer as a counselor this year.

Expanding Camp Kesem
Camp Kesem has grown quickly
from humble roots. Having started
as a small project of the Stanford
Hillel in 2001, the camp was initially
only able to accommodate 37
campers, according to camp direc
tor Heather Paul. After the camp
met with initial success, Hillel staff
member Iris Rave founded Camp
Kesem National in August 2002 in
order to help other college students
start similar programs.
Since then, Camp Kesem has
grown to encompass 53 other camps
hosted by different universities
across the country, including UC-
Berkeley, MIT, Yale and Northwest
ern.
Back at Stanford, the original
Camp Kesem has expanded and will
be at full capacity for this coming
summer, hosting 130 campers.
Despite experiencing maximum
enrollment, Stanford's chapter of
Kesem is currently focused on
growing in depth rather than
breadth, according to Paul, who
added that she is working on devel
oping an extensive program for
counselor alumni that would allow
them to stay involved even after
graduation from Stanford.
That additional depth may also

include more support for campers
throughout the year. Reunions in
the fall and spring have allowed
campers to stay involved with Ke
sem. Meanwhile, staying updated
with families' situations when they
are away from camp gives coun
selors the chance to support
campers beyond the one-week
camp.

"I get the best camper emails,"
Paul said. "I love them. They make
me so happy."
When the camp is not in session,
the student leadership must devote
a significant amount of time to rais
ing funds to support the camp's abil
ity to not charge campers. Over the
academic year, two coordinators
work on funding from grants and in
dividual ask letters.
Kesem also holds smaller
fundraisers with other community
organizations, like Treehouse, Pizza
My Heart, Stanford Hair and the
Athlete Date Auction. Sixty percent
of Kesem's funding, however, comes
from private donors.
Ultimately, the counselors em
phasized their desire to be a part of
a community like none other.
"To see so many people who are
so talented and knowledgeable give
all of their resources to such a noble
cause is so inspiring," McKenzie
said.

"It's amazing to have the chance
to contribute to the [kids'] happi
ness and well-being and to be a sup
port network for them to rely on,"
Rosellini said.
