## Camp Kesem grows from humble roots 
### HANNAH GRACE 
For almost 13 years, Stanford under
graduates have volunteered to organize
Camp Kesem, a yearly sleepover summer
camp for boys and girls aged six to 16 whose
parents have or have had cancer.
In Hebrew, kesem means "magic." For
the Stanford students that make Camp Ke
sem a possibility, that magic is found in the
community the camp nurtures.
"That magic comes from the people and
the people alone," said Ben Rosellini 'l5.

The camper experience
According to Ben McKenzie 'l5, a mem
ber of Kesem's leadership team, the camp
has two main purposes.
"We want to allow [the campers] to be

kids, and to show them they're not alone, to
take away the isolating aspect of a parent
who has cancer," McKenzie said.
Perhaps the most distinctive aspect of
the counseling experience is the nicknames
each counselor assumes for the duration of
their tenure.
"The names enable us to be our best
selves when we take on the name and the

persona behind that name," explained Scott
"Chimp" Swartz 'l4, co-chair of the coordi
nator team.
As with any other camp, Camp Kesem
features games, singing and nature hikes.
However, there are also structured times
when campers are given a safe space to
