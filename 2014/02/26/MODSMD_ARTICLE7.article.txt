### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
All Stanford student
athletes are inherent
ly very versatile peo
ple, as they must con
sistently meet the rig- '
orous demands associated with
both them Stanford educations and
their athletic careers. However, af

years around the Stanford softball
program, it is clear to me that Erin
Ashby takes such versatility to a
new level. As a two-year starter for
the Cardinal, Ashby has been
called upon to play at catcher, sec
ond base, first base, hit in the des
ignated player spot and even pitch
