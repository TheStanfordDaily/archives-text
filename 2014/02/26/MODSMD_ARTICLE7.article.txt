# LIMITLESS POTENTIAL
## ASHBY'S VERSATILITY KNOWS NO BOUNDS 
### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
All Stanford student
athletes are inherent
ly very versatile peo
ple, as they must con
sistently meet the rig- '
orous demands associated with
both them Stanford educations and
their athletic careers. However, af
ter having spent the last three
years around the Stanford softball
program, it is clear to me that Erin
Ashby takes such versatility to a
new level. As a two-year starter for
the Cardinal, Ashby has been
called upon to play at catcher, sec
ond base, first base, hit in the des
ignated player spot and even pitch

in the circle.
In addition to her unique
ability to serve in multiple
different roles on the field,
Ashby has also been able to
adeptly manage her academ
ic and extracurricular com
mitments off the diamond, all
the while maintaining her hu
mility and kind-hearted na
ture.
Softball
Since she was young, Ash
by has achieved a tremen
dous amount of success on
the softball field. Growing up
in Southern California, she
played club softball for the So
Cal Athletics, one of the most
decorated softball clubs in
the country. As one of the star
players on her travel-ball
squad, Ashby helped the Ath
letics win back-to-back na
tional championships in 2010
and 2011. Reflecting on her
club softball experience, Ash
by noted that her time with
the Athletics had a huge im

pact on her development as a
softball player.
Ashby was also grateful
for her parents' sacrifices
that allowed her to play at
such an elite level of softball.
"[Club softball] is a huge time
commitment as a family," she
said. "My parents have in
vested a lot of time and effort
into making me into the play
er that I am [today]."
With her parents' sup
port, Ashby also shined play
ing softball for her high
school, Crescenta Valley
High. Ashby was a four-time
letter winner in high school,
while also winning the All-
Area Player of the Year
Award in two consecutive
seasons. Finally, after her
senior season in high school
in 2011, Ashby was named an
All-American in recognition
of a campaign in which she hit
.636 with 10 home runs and
43 RBIs, notching a 1.159
slugging percentage.
After graduating from
Crescenta Valley High and
arriving on the Farm in 2011,
Ashby spent her true fresh
man season serving largely
as a pinch-hitter, playing in 18
games during the Cardinal's

2012 campaign. While Ashby
may have received limited
playing time as a freshman,
she emerged last season as
an essential full-time starter
when she was called upon to
play at first base, catch and
hit in the designated player's
spot over the course of 58
games.
Ashby certainly made the
most of her opportunities in
2013, finishing the season
with a .291 batting average
and 35 RBIs, good for fourth
on the team. Ashby also
recorded 15 multi-hit games
and nine multi-RBI games
while blasting six home runs
and slugging .479, which was
Stanford's third-best slug
ging percentage last season.
More importantly, she played
some of her best softball last
year when it mattered most
for the Cardinal, namely
during the team's appear
ance at the Lincoln Regional
in the NCAA tournament.

Another defining moment
for Ashby last season came
during a three-game set at
Cal, a series that Ashby de
scribed as her favorite team
moment from her three
years on the Farm. In help

ing to pace the Cardinal to
its first ever sweep of Cal,
Ashby batted .333 with five
RBIs, three walks, two runs
scored and a towering home
run to left field.
"Beating your rival
school is always an awesome
feeling, but we gave them no
mercy," Ashby said, refer
ring to how the Cardinal
outscored its rivals in Berke
ley 37-12 over the three
games.
This season, Ashby has
started 15 of the Cardinal's
17 games, notching nine
RBIs and four extra-base
hits over 42 at-bats. She has
also continued to deliver
with runners in scoring posi
tion, posting a .313 batting
average in such situations.
Asked about her experi
ence as a Stanford student
athlete, Ashby cited the im
portance of time manage
ment.
"[Being a student-ath
lete] is a grind. Any student
athlete would tell you that,"
she said. "You practice hours
on end, and you still have to
keep up academically while
making up any time and
classes that you miss."
However, Ashby also
pointed to team camaraderie
as one of biggest positives of
her athletic experience at
Stanford.
"We have good dancers on
the team, and we have not so
good dancers on the team,"
Ashby said with a laugh.
"Dancing is definitely fun,
because we can all laugh,
make light of our quirks, and
have a good time."
School
In addition to her accom
plishments on the field, Ash
by has also excelled in the
classroom as a communica
tions major.
"I love my comm classes,"
she said. "The communica
tions department at Stan
ford is unbelievable, and the
material is really relatable to
life."

Asked what her favorite
course has been at Stanford,
Ashby surprised me when
answered with her winter
and spring quarters' Intro
duction to Humanities
(IHUM) class, Epic Jour
neys, Modern Quests. Be
yond my initial shock that
Ashby was an "IHUM kid,"
her care for the subject mat

ter was evident when our
conversation turned to
Dante's "Inferno."
"The readings that we
chose and the topics that we
talked about [in IHUM]
were so incredibly fascinat
ing," she said. "There is so
much depth and sophistica
tion in [Dante's] writing that
it was a real interesting
read."
Life at Stanford
On top of her work in the
classroom and on the softball
field, Ashby is also a member
of the Delta Delta Delta
sorority and serves as its Li
censing Chair. This year, in
addition to her obligations
associated with a leadership
position in her sorority, she
has managed to balance a
full course load with her ath
letic endeavors. Ashby said
that the key to balancing her
responsibilities is establish
ing her priorities and getting
things done, adding, "the
best thing about my sorority

is a lot of the [other mem
bers] are my close friends, so
we will make time to see
each other."

A particularly meaningful
part of Ashby and her sis
ters' experiences in Tri-Delt
has been the sorority's sup
port of the St. Jude's Chil
dren's Research Hospital, a
world-renowned medical fa
cility that provides care to
children battling cancer and
other catastrophic diseases.
Along with the multiple
fundraisers that Tri-Delt
hosts in support of St. Jude
each year, including the up
coming Stacks for St. Jude
breakfast, Ashby also point
ed to the cards and bracelets
that the sorority sends to St.
Jude's patients as something
that is incredibly special to
her and her fellow Tri-Delt
sisters.
"The cards or crafts or
bracelets... have more of an
impact [than raising money]
for us because it is something
that the child will receive be
sides care," she said. "It is
something personal that is
filled with love and meant for
each child that is going
through a difficult time."
"Footprints on the moon"
One of Ashby's favorite
quotes is, "Don't tell me the
sky's the limit when there
are footprints on the moon."
To her, the quote reflects
that "there are no limitations
on what you are able to ac
complish, regardless of what
people tell you. It is about
going after what you want,
and knowing that you can
get to that next step or level
or accomplish whatever it
may be."
In turn, it echoes Ashby's
journey both as a softball
player and a person she
has already made many of
her dreams a reality due to
her hard work, dedication
and selflessness.
In reflecting on her col
lege experience, Ashby said,
"I am thankful for every
thing that I have gone
through, both good and bad,
and anywhere in between.
We don't know where we are
going to go and what we are
going to go through, but [col
lege] helps us all find our
selves."
