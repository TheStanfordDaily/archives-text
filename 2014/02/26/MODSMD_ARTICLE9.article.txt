## Senate talks SAFE Reform proposal 
### PETER MOON DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
The 15th ASSU Undergraduate
Senate discussed the Student Activi
ties Fee (SAFE) Reform proposal at
its meeting Tbesday evening.
Authored by various members of
the ASSU, including co-president
Dan Ashton 'l4 and financial analysts
Justine Moore 'l6 and Olivia Moore
'l6, the SAFE proposal aims to lower
the student activities fee, recycle un
used money currently trapped in the
system and make it easier for student
organizations to apply for funding.
Its passage as an amendment will
require two-thirds approval from the
Senate, two-thirds approval from the
Graduate Student Council and the
approval of 15 percent of the under
graduate student population in the
spring election. If approved, the re
form will be fully implemented in the
2015-16 academic year.
Before turning to wilting the ac
tual amendment, the Senate had
spent several meetings debating the
inefficiencies in the allocation of fund
ing to student organizations.

"The SAFE Reform Bill will sim
plify the complex special fees
process," said Angela Zhang 'l6, ap
propriations committee chair. "It is
definitely an improvement from the
current system."
Justine Moore and Olivia Moore
explained that Major, Minor and
Quick Grants will replace the pre-ex
isting system of special and general
fees.
"Like Special Fees, Major Grants
will be the major source of funding
for big student organizations," Jus
tine Moore said. "Prior to putting the
grants on ballot, they have to be ap
proved by the Rinding Board and
Senate."
Replacing the Appropriations
Committee, the Fiinding Board will
be responsible for the allocation of
student fees. It will be composed of
four senators and three non-Senate
members appointed by the outgoing
Rinding Board.
Under the proposed reform,
smaller student organizations will
have the opportunity to apply for Mi
nor Grants, which are available once
a month and will effectively replace

the current system of general fees
funding. Quick Grants will also be
made available to organizations that
need big one-time expenses or last
minute funding for activities they
couldn't have requested in advance.
Under the proposal's stipulations,
special fees groups will also have
their reserves frozen on June 30 of
each year. The groups will subse
quently be able to spend the reserves
but not add to them.

Finally, SAFE Reform also pro
poses a cap on funding for student or
ganizations, thus limiting increases
in student activities fees. The reform
will lower the fee levied on students
by approximately $9O per student
per year.

The Senate ended the meeting
with Zhang's update on the recom
mended budget for the Robotics
Club, which was reduced by approxi
mately $90,000 from the proposed es
timate of $150,000 in response to the
late submission of the group's special
fees application.
