## Home-plate collisions should be eliminated 
### Do-Hyoung Park 
Major League Base
ball has been imple
menting some ma
jor changes in the
last few seasons.
First came instant replay on home
runs, followed by managerial chal
lenges. Now, it looks like there will be
yet another perturbation to the estab
lished rules of Major League Base
ball a policy that discourages most
collisions at home plate.
What in the world took so long?
I've always hated the concept of
the home-plate collision, an idea that
has seemed out of place to me along
side the other established elements of
the game of baseball. In a game based
on pinpoint timing and accuracy of
movement, the show of extraneous
force involved in the collision detracts
from the game by fostering injuries
and bad blood between both players
involved.

The concept is easy enough to un
derstand— sometimes, a player at
tempting to score will ram his body
into the catcher to either prevent the
catcher from cleanly receiving the
throw to the plate before it arrives or
to attempt to jar the ball loose in the
case that the catcher is already in pos
session of it. But baseball isn't a con
tact sport, and never really has been.
In a game where nobody wears any
serious body protection, it honestly
puzzles me that players have been al
lowed to hit each other in such fashion
for as long as they have.

One of the main issues that I have
with it is that it is remarkably one
sided in favor of the offense. Keep in
mind that the baserunner is splinting
towards the plate at full speed and
has time to both physically and men
tally brace for impact at a favorable
angle before contact is made. At best,
the catcher doesn't end up with the
ball and a run is scored, but the worst
case scenario is an out with some ex
tra oomph for the runner.
However, for the catcher, the same
action can be incredibly dangerous.
For one, the primary focus of the
catcher when a play is being made at
the plate is to catch the throw coming
in, only becoming wary of the
baserunner only after he has caught
the ball. Because of this, he is neither
physically nor mentally prepared to
meet the imminent impact. In most
cases, he'll just get the wind knocked
out of him and lie on the dirt for a
while before getting up to resume
play. However, in certain extreme cas
es, concussions and serious physical
injuries can present grave dangers
for these catchers —just ask any Gi
ants fan about poor Buster Posey's
gruesome broken leg that benched
him for four months.

Hitting a defenseless player that
hasn't had the chance to brace for the
impact doesn't have a place in any
other sport. Heck, in football, it'll usu
ally land you either an unnecessary
roughness or targeting penalty
both of which would cost your team 15
yards. And that's in a sport in which
everybody wears pads and hard colli
sions are applauded and celebrated.
Why is it that in baseball, the same
act is perfectly acceptable?
In addition, these collisions can
significantly impact the flow of an in
ning. Say that a runner coming home
barrels into the catcher and the throw
sails past home plate and to the back
stop. While the catcher lies dazed af
ter receiving the impact, other
baserunners are allowed to advance
at their own risk, because the ball is
still live until another defender gets to
it. This is essentially taking advan
tage of an opponent's injury for your
gain evidently, completely okay ac
cording to the rules of baseball.
It also presents an inconsistency
in how the game is played, because
collisions happen at home, but not at
any of the other three bases anoth
er thing that has always made me
scratch my head. If we're letting
baserunners take out catchers at
home plate, why not just let them
clothesline the first baseman while
we're at it? Why are second basemen,
shortstops and third baseman all safe
as well? Catchers already take a lot of
wear' and tear behind the plate from
receiving over 100 pitches every
game; do we just really hate catchers
or something?
And finally, seeing how angry
players get at each other for hit-by
pitches, it's astounding that we don't
see more fights following home-plate
collisions an even more egregious,
blatant show of force, in my opinion.
You can seriously hurt a catcher in a
collision arguably just as much as you
can hurt a hitter with an improperly

placed pitch. We saw such a
fight happen in late 2013 be
tween two Australian teams.
And who can forget Cubs
catcher Michael Barrett suck
er-punching White Sox coun
terpart A. J. Pierzynski back in
2006? Baseball fights are seri
ous business; injuries, suspen
sions and fines are likely to oc
cur, and it's just not a good

idea in general to get two
teams to hate each other when
projectiles flying at speeds up
wards of 90 miles an hour are
involved. So why give them
another reason to fight?

While the new rule dis
courages collisions by calling
baserunners out when they
initiate contact with catchers
that possess the ball and are
blocking the plate and calling
baserunners safe when catch
ers are seen obstructing the
runner's path to the plate
without already having re
ceived the throw, it still doesn't

ban collisions altogether
something that really needs to
be done sooner rather than
later for the sake of both the
players and the game.

Do-Hyoung Park was trau
matized in little league base
ball by being a puny catcher
put up against much bigger
baserunners who slammed
into him without remorse.
