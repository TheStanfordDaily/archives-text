## Seeking high notes in the Music City 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN DESK EDITOR 
The road doesn't get any easier or shorter
for Stanford baseball this weekend.
After dropping its first two three-game series to
Rice and Texas, respectively, the Cardinal (4-4) now
faces a weekend bout with an opponent widely re
garded as more formidable than any previous chal
lenger on a field 2,000 miles away from the com
forts of the Farm.
Beginning on Friday, the Cardinal swings down
south to Nashville, Tenn. to take on the No. 4 Van
derbilt Commodores (8-2) in a three-game series.
The task ahead for a young Stanford team still find
ing its footing certainly seems daunting, but the
Cardinal remains excited about the opportunity to
prove itself on a national stage.
"They're a very good team... Obviously playing
them there will be really tough," said Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess. "It'll be good for us. That's
why we schedule them, so we put a good gauge on
us of where we need to be."
Marquess also mentioned that freshman pitcher
Cal Quantrill, who has started in both of the Card's
previous Friday night contests, will move back in
the rotation to Sunday after getting the nod for
Tuesday's game against the University of San
Francisco.
Freshman righties Brett Hanewich and Chris
Viall will most likely take the mound on Friday and
Saturday, respectively. Hanewich leads all Cardinal
starters with a 1.08 ERA, but
he has yet to record a win this
season after his two previous
outings resulted in no-deci
sions. Viall, with a 3.46 ERA,
has not pitched in a Stanford
loss this season, as his two
previous starts ended in
blowout wins for the Card.
Meanwhile, in the other
dugout, Vanderbilt head
coach Tim Corbin has many
pitching weapons to choose
from in his arsenal, but
righty Tyler Beede has stood
out with a strong start to the
2014 season. The junior from
Auburn, Mass. boasts a 2-0
record and an 0.82 ERA.
Starting pitchers Jared
Miller and Tyler Ferguson,
who also hold undefeated
records and ERAs under
1.00, will likely start on Sat
urday and Sunday.
Despite opening the sea
son on a tear with a 7-0
record and asserting their
presence as one of the top
teams in college baseball, the
Commodores have shown
some vulnerability ahead of
then- showdown with Stan
ford. On Tuesday, the Com
modores fell 3-2 to the West
ern Kentucky Hilltoppers

and lost again on Wednesday
to the Evansville Aces 8-3.
Both losses came at home on
Hawkins Field. While Van
derbilt did not send out its
formidable weekend starting
pitchers, the offense sput
tered at times on both Tues
day and Wednesday.
To combat the recent of
fensive struggles, Vanderbilt
will look towards its leading
batters to get runs on the
board. Junior first baseman
Zander Weil leads Vanderbilt
with twelve hits and a 3.64
batting average. Freshman
left fielder Bryan Reynolds
has also burst on the scene
with a .344 average and a
team-leading 8 RBIs. Vandy
will also look for key contri
butions from sophomore sec
ond baseman Dansby Swan
son, who holds a .306 batting
average after rebounding
from a season-ending shoul
der injury last season.
The Cardinal, similarly,
will look for strong run sup
port from its veteran leaders.
Junior third baseman Alex
Blandino knocked in a two
run double against San Fran
cisco on Tuesday and contin
ues to look sharp behind the
plate as the season continues.
Blandino is hitting .429 on the
season, trailing only senior
Brett Michael Doran, who
holds a .522 average. Doran's
strong start to the season has

been a huge boost for the
Cardinal thus far. Finally,
look for junior center fielder
Austin Slater, who leads the
Card with 10 RBIs, to help
set the tone for Stanford be
hind the plate as it will look to
jump out to early leads in a
hostile environment.
While a point of concern
earlier in the season, Stan
ford's fielding looked very
strong against both Texas
and San Francisco. Although
he has struggled behind the
plate thus far, sophomore
shortstop Drew Jackson has
routinely displayed his in
credible range and arm
strength and Stanford will
surely rely on him to continue
making plays in Nashville.
Senior Danny Diekroeger has
also done a solid job since
moving to first base at the
start of the season.
If the Cardinal can contin
ue its recent streak of timely
hitting and solid defense, it
should give a struggling
Yandy ball club a lot of prob
lems and will have a good
chance to earn its first mar
quee series win of the season.
The matchup in the Music
City begins Friday at 4 p.m.
with games on Saturday at
noon and Sunday at 10 a.m.
as well.

The road doesn't get any easier or shorter
for Stanford baseball this weekend.
After dropping its first two three-game series to
Rice and Texas, respectively, the Cardinal (4-4) now
faces a weekend bout with an opponent widely re
garded as more formidable than any previous chal
lenger on a field 2,000 miles away from the com
forts of the Farm.
Beginning on Friday, the Cardinal swings down
south to Nashville, Tenn. to take on the No. 4 Van
derbilt Commodores (8-2) in a three-game series.
The task ahead for a young Stanford team still find
ing its footing certainly seems daunting, but the
Cardinal remains excited about the opportunity to
prove itself on a national stage.
"They're a very good team... Obviously playing
them there will be really tough," said Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess. "It'll be good for us. That's
why we schedule them, so we put a good gauge on
us of where we need to be."
Marquess also mentioned that freshman pitcher
Cal Quantrill, who has started in both of the Card's
previous Friday night contests, will move back in
the rotation to Sunday after getting the nod for
Tuesday's game against the University of San
Francisco.
Freshman righties Brett Hanewich and Chris
Viall will most likely take the mound on Friday and
Saturday, respectively. Hanewich leads all Cardinal
starters with a 1.08 ERA, but
he has yet to record a win this
season after his two previous
outings resulted in no-deci
sions. Viall, with a 3.46 ERA,
has not pitched in a Stanford
loss this season, as his two
previous starts ended in
blowout wins for the Card.
Meanwhile, in the other
dugout, Vanderbilt head
coach Tim Corbin has many
pitching weapons to choose
from in his arsenal, but
righty Tyler Beede has stood
out with a strong start to the
2014 season. The junior from
Auburn, Mass. boasts a 2-0
record and an 0.82 ERA.
Starting pitchers Jared
Miller and Tyler Ferguson,
who also hold undefeated
records and ERAs under
1.00, will likely start on Sat
urday and Sunday.
Despite opening the sea
son on a tear with a 7-0
record and asserting their
presence as one of the top
teams in college baseball, the
Commodores have shown
some vulnerability ahead of
then- showdown with Stan
ford. On Tuesday, the Com
modores fell 3-2 to the West
ern Kentucky Hilltoppers

and lost again on Wednesday
to the Evansville Aces 8-3.
Both losses came at home on
Hawkins Field. While Van
derbilt did not send out its
formidable weekend starting
pitchers, the offense sput
tered at times on both Tues
day and Wednesday.
To combat the recent of
fensive struggles, Vanderbilt
will look towards its leading
batters to get runs on the
board. Junior first baseman
Zander Weil leads Vanderbilt
with twelve hits and a 3.64
batting average. Freshman
left fielder Bryan Reynolds
has also burst on the scene
with a .344 average and a
team-leading 8 RBIs. Vandy
will also look for key contri
butions from sophomore sec
ond baseman Dansby Swan
son, who holds a .306 batting
average after rebounding
from a season-ending shoul
der injury last season.
The Cardinal, similarly,
will look for strong run sup
port from its veteran leaders.
Junior third baseman Alex
Blandino knocked in a two
run double against San Fran
cisco on Tuesday and contin
ues to look sharp behind the
plate as the season continues.
Blandino is hitting .429 on the
season, trailing only senior
Brett Michael Doran, who
holds a .522 average. Doran's
strong start to the season has

been a huge boost for the
Cardinal thus far. Finally,
look for junior center fielder
Austin Slater, who leads the
Card with 10 RBIs, to help
set the tone for Stanford be
hind the plate as it will look to
jump out to early leads in a
hostile environment.
While a point of concern
earlier in the season, Stan
ford's fielding looked very
strong against both Texas
and San Francisco. Although
he has struggled behind the
plate thus far, sophomore
shortstop Drew Jackson has
routinely displayed his in
credible range and arm
strength and Stanford will
surely rely on him to continue
making plays in Nashville.
Senior Danny Diekroeger has
also done a solid job since
moving to first base at the
start of the season.
If the Cardinal can contin
ue its recent streak of timely
hitting and solid defense, it
should give a struggling
Yandy ball club a lot of prob
lems and will have a good
chance to earn its first mar
quee series win of the season.
The matchup in the Music
City begins Friday at 4 p.m.
with games on Saturday at
noon and Sunday at 10 a.m.
as well.
