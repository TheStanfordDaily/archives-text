# TRACK & FIELD
## MPSFs await hopeful Card track athletes 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
When Stanford's track and field squads head to
the University of Washington this weekend for the
MPSF Indoor Championships, the individual goals
of the different athletes will vary depending on
where they stand with respect to the nation's lead
ing times. While some will be striving to continue
to improve and potentially set new personal
records, others will be trying to make the push in
to the top 16 in the nation in their events in order
to qualify for the upcoming NCAA Indoor Cham
pionships. And the others that are already in the
top 16 of their events will simply aim to race a sol
id meet, score points for the team and solidify their
times.
In order to do so, however, they will need to ex
cel in a tough field of 12 men's teams and 17
women's teams that will be represented in Seattle,
including the Arizona State men, who are the
reigning back-to-back champions of this meet, and
the No. 1 Oregon women, who will be looking to
take home then- fourth title at this meet in the last
five seasons.
