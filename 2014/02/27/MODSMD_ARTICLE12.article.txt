# TRACK & FIELD
## MPSFs await hopeful Card track athletes 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
When Stanford's track and field squads head to
the University of Washington this weekend for the
MPSF Indoor Championships, the individual goals
of the different athletes will vary depending on
where they stand with respect to the nation's lead
ing times. While some will be striving to continue
to improve and potentially set new personal
records, others will be trying to make the push in
to the top 16 in the nation in their events in order
to qualify for the upcoming NCAA Indoor Cham
pionships. And the others that are already in the
top 16 of their events will simply aim to race a sol
id meet, score points for the team and solidify their
times.
In order to do so, however, they will need to ex
cel in a tough field of 12 men's teams and 17
women's teams that will be represented in Seattle,
including the Arizona State men, who are the
reigning back-to-back champions of this meet, and
the No. 1 Oregon women, who will be looking to
take home then- fourth title at this meet in the last
five seasons.
The Cardinal men will be
led by senior Michael
Atchoo, who set the meet
record in the mile last year
with his time of 3:57.14.
Atchoo will compete in the
3,000 meters and in the dis
tance medley relay, in which
he, senior Marco Berlototti,
sophomore Steven Solomon
and junior Luke Lefebure
recorded the nation's fourth
best time this season
(9:28.95) during the Penn
State National Invitational
last month.
Solomon, a finalist in the
400 meters at the 2012 Lon
don Olympics, will look to se
cure his bid to the NCAAs in
both the 400 meters and the
4x400 meter relay. His 400
time of 46.42 is currently tied
for 13th in the nation.
Senior Erik Olson is al
ready in good position to
make the NCAAs heading
into this weekend, as his re
cent time of 13:42.56 in the
5,000 meters at the UW
Husky Classic two weeks ago
is currently sixth in the na
tion. Because runners are
ideally peaking at this point
in the season with the
NCAAs drawing near, Olson
will look to run another solid
time in the 5000 at the MPS-
Fs to secure that bid.
In the field, freshman Dy
lan Duvio will be looking to
make a big impact in the pole
vault after already having as
serted himself as one of the
premier rising athletes in the
event. He has set multiple
personal bests in the event
already this season and dis
played a steady improve
ment, and he currently owns
the third-best all-time indoor
Stanford vault with his vault
of 5.32 meters at the Don
Kirby Invite two weeks ago.
Although the men's squad
lacks the depth to finish in a
top position as a team at the
MPSF meet, it will still look
to qualify several individuals
and the distance medley re
lay squad for the NCAAs in
two weeks.
On the women's side, the
Cardinal is primed to both
finish in a strong position as
a team and also send several
of its most consistent per

formers to the NCAAs. Stan
ford currently has three fe
male middle-distance run
ners with top-10 times na
tionally in the 800 meters:
fifth-year senior Justine Fe
dronic, sophomore Claudia
Saunders and sophomore
Amy Weissenbach. As they
run the 800 at the MPSFs
this weekend, they will al
ready be in good position to
qualify for nationals but will
still look to solidify that sta
tus against a strong field that
will also be peaking at about
this time.
Both Fedronic and Weis
senbach broke the previous
school record in the 800 dur
ing the Penn State National
Invitational at the end of
January with their times of
2:03.25 and 2:05.50. Saun
ders joined the club at the
UW Husky Classic two
weeks ago, when her time of
2:05.07 also beat the previ
ous school record of 2:05.56.
Fedronic's time is currently
second in the country, put
ting her in great position to
qualify for NCAAs after not
having competed indoors last
season.

Sophomore sprinter
Kristyn Williams has also ex
celled this season and broke
the all-time Stanford indoor
record in the 400 meters in
her first meet this season
with her time of 53.39. Al
though that time is just 26th
in the country so far this
year, she has very strong po
tential to improve upon that
time, as evidenced by her
52.7 split over the 400-meter
leg of the school record-set
ting distance medley relay at
the Penn State National in
late January.
On the shot put, fifth-year
senior Alyssa Wisdom will be
looking to qualify for her sec
ond consecutive indoor
NCAAs after she placed
fourth at the MPSFs last
season with a personal best
of 16.97 meters.
The MPSF Champi
onships will begin on Friday
and will last until early Sat
urday afternoon in Seattle,
with numerous NCAA quali
fiers likely to be decided dur
ing the meet.
