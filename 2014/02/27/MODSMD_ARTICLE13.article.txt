# SCORCHED BY SUN DEVILS
## 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
After a strong stretch of performances
that saw the Cardinal win five of its previous
six games, including an upset victory over No.
23 UCLA on Saturday, the Stanford men's
basketball team (18-9, 9-6 Pac-12) put forth a
forgettable performance in a dreadful road
defeat to the Arizona State Sun Devils (20-8,
9-6) on Wednesday night, falling 76-64.
It was trouble from the start for the Car
dinal, which failed to remotely resemble the
team that had taken care of UCLA from start
to finish on Saturday. Stanford opened the
game with three consecutive turnovers, a
tasty treat for a Sun Devils team that was
clearly hungry following a 33-point beatdown
at the hands of the Utah Utes on Sunday.
If it weren't for junior guard Chasson
Randle, Stanford would have been run off the
court early in the first half. Instead, the Illi
nois native scored 15 of Stanford's 29 points in
the opening frame to keep his team within
contact of the Sun Devils, cutting the deficit
to 10 by halftime by nailing a 3-pointer with
four seconds left in the period.
The Cardinal got itself into a big hole ear
ly thanks to an abysmal offensive perform
ance during the first half. Stanford committed
10 turnovers and totaled just one assist while
shooting a pedestrian 41.7 percent from the
field during the opening frame. The team
looked out of sorts on both ends of the floor,
leaving 3-point shooters open on late rota
tions and repeatedly throwing the ball away
on offense.

Credit is due to the Sun Devils, who did a
fantastic job of guarding passes to the post
and taking away the inside-out formula that
has worked so effectively for senior big men

Stefan Nastic and Dwight Powell this season.
Stanford was unable to make adjustments on
the fly, and as a result, the Sun Devils were
able to open up the large early lead.
For the first five minutes of the second
half, it looked as though the Cardinal might
be able to claw its way back into the game.
Stanford cut the lead to single digits with
15:31 left to play after an Anthony Brown free
throw.
Unfortunately for Stanford, Arizona
State's Jahii Carson took over shortly there
after, and Stanford helped him plenty along
the way to an easy ASU victory.
Carson nailed a jumper on the ensuing
ASU possession, and after a bad shot by Pow
ell ended a quick Stanford trip down the floor,
Carson found Bo Barnes for a 3-pointer to ex
tend the Sun Devil lead to 16. Stanford turned
it over on its next two possessions, and anoth
er smooth jumper by Carson pushed the ASU
lead even further out of reach. When Randle
fouled out with 7:11 remaining and Stanford
trailing by 16, it was clear there would be no
Cardinal comeback on this night.
Randle finished with 17 points for Stan
ford on 7-of-14 shooting and was largely re
sponsible for any offensive success the Cardi
nal managed while he was on the floor.
Brown tallied 21 points and seven re
bounds during a too-little-too-late comeback
attempt, and was the lone bright spot in the
second half for Stanford that Randle was in
the first.
Yet it was Carson that was clearly the man
of the night, scoring 23 of his 26 points in the
second half to guide the Sun Devils to victory,
and in the process remind tortured Stanford
basketball fans everywhere of his 34-point

outburst against the Cardi
nal in last year's Pac-12
tournament.

He was aided in victory
by fellow backcourt mate
Jermaine Marshall, who fin
ished with 16 points after
having dropped 22 on the
Cardinal the last time out.
Stanford has little time or
margin for error to turn

things back around, as the
Cardinal will head to Tucson
on Sunday to take on the con
ference-leading Arizona
Wildcats in a rematch of
Stanford's most heartbreak
ing defeat to date this season.
After struggling to find
their identity for a time after
the season-ending injury to
starting forward Brandon
Ashley, the Wildcats are now
arguably playing their best
basketball of the season. Ari
zona has put together con
secutive routs of Colorado
and Cal, both projected to be

NCAA Tournament teams at
the moment by all major me
dia prognosticators.
If Stanford wants to have
a chance of upsetting the
Wildcats on their home floor,
the team that showed up
against UCLA, and not the
one that played against
ASU, will have to take the
court for the Cardinal.

Tipoff is at 5 p.m. on Sun
day, and the game will be tel
evised on ESPNU.
