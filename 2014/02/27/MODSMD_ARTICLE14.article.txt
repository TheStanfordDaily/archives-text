# Seeking Husky revenge
## 
### LAUREN LOCKETT STAFF WRITER 
After escaping its Los Angeles
trip with two comeback victories, the
Stanford women's basketball team
(26-2, 15-1 Pac-12) will welcome the
Washington Huskies (16-11, 9-7) to
Maples Pavilion on Thursday night
in one of its last remaining games of
the regular season. Stanford
clinched its 14th consecutive Pac-12
title over the weekend, so though
the contest won't mean much in the
Pac-12 standings, the Cardinal will
be looking to get revenge for its on
ly conference loss of the year.
On Feb. 9, the last time that the
two teams played, Washington was
able to squeak out a victory on its
home court, beating the Cardinal 87-
82. The game marked only the sec
ond conference loss for Stanford in
five years. In that game, the
Huskies had five players reach dou
ble figures in scoring. However, this
time, the Cardinal will look to tight
en up its defense and ramp up the in
tensity on both sides of the ball.
Washington will come to the
Farm looking for its dynamic guards
to continue to power its offense.
Freshman Kelsey Plum, who burned
Stanford with 23 points in the last
matchup, and junior Jazmine Davis
