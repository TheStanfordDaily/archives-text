# Seeking Husky revenge
## 
### LAUREN LOCKETT STAFF WRITER 
After escaping its Los Angeles
trip with two comeback victories, the
Stanford women's basketball team
(26-2, 15-1 Pac-12) will welcome the
Washington Huskies (16-11, 9-7) to
Maples Pavilion on Thursday night
in one of its last remaining games of
the regular season. Stanford
clinched its 14th consecutive Pac-12
title over the weekend, so though
the contest won't mean much in the
Pac-12 standings, the Cardinal will
be looking to get revenge for its on
ly conference loss of the year.
On Feb. 9, the last time that the
two teams played, Washington was
able to squeak out a victory on its
home court, beating the Cardinal 87-
82. The game marked only the sec
ond conference loss for Stanford in
five years. In that game, the
Huskies had five players reach dou
ble figures in scoring. However, this
time, the Cardinal will look to tight
en up its defense and ramp up the in
tensity on both sides of the ball.
Washington will come to the
Farm looking for its dynamic guards
to continue to power its offense.
Freshman Kelsey Plum, who burned
Stanford with 23 points in the last
matchup, and junior Jazmine Davis
average a combined 40.1 points per

game for the Huskies, a
number accounting for over
half of Washington's offense.
The attacking pair is also
able to get to the free-throw
line at very high rates, as
both Plum and Davis have
attempted over 182 free
throws apiece this year. If
the Stanford defense is able
to keep the two of them from
getting into the lane at will,
the Cardinal will have a
much easier road to victory
this time around.

The most important part
of the Cardinal's offensive
game plan will again include
getting the ball into the
hands of its most trusted
playmakers, National Play

er of the Year candidate
Chiney Ogwumike and point
guard Amber Orrange, ear
ly and often.

Over the weekend in Los
Angeles, Ogwumike aver
aged 26.5 points and 11 re
bounds, while Orrange aver
aged 11 points and four as
sists while hitting 56.3 per
cent of her shots from the
field. In the last contest
against the Huskies, Wash
ington was able to shut
down Ogwumike when it
counted, something the Car
dinal cannot allow to happen
again.

Thursday's game, and
the next one against Wash
ington State, will be impor
tant in allowing the team's
other role players further
opportunities to develop and
get comfortable before the
conference tournament.
Over the weekend, head

coach Tara VanDerveer trot
ted out a new starting line
up with junior Bonnie
Samuelson and freshmen
Erica McCall and Brianna
Roberson joining Orrange
and Ogwumike. All of these
players will likely play sig
nificant roles in Stanford's
postseason campaign this
year, and so it is important
for them to continue their
strong development now.
The Cardinal, which
leads the all-time series 43-
15, will attempt to further
the pattern of dominance
over Washington on Thurs
day night. However, Wash
ington has won six of its past
eight games and will look to
put up a tough fight.
The game will tip off at 8
p.m. at Maples Pavilion.
