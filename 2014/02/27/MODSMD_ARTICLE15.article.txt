## Revolution in Ukraine: Take Two

I consumption, it has been de
-Lcided to switch off the light
at the end of the tunnel." Such was
Ukrainian comedian Dmytro
Chekalkin's line upon the 2010 inau
guration of President Viktor
Yanukovych.
After a decade of failed reform
and economic collapse under the
first two post-Soviet leaders and an
other decade of political chaos
(there are Wikipedia articles on the
"2006 Ukrainian political crisis," the
"2007 Ukrainian political crisis" and
the "2008 Ukrainian political cri
sis") under a succession of govern
ments that promised much and de
livered little, the presidential elec
tions had gone to the very man who
had tried and failed to steal that
same office six years earlier.
The events of 2004 known as
the Orange Revolution repre
sented a hope that the power of the
people could bring down Ukraine's
oligarchic and corrupt political
structure and replace it with a
Western-style democracy. Peaceful
street protests forced the rigged
elections to be rerun under close in
ternational scrutiny, and President
Bush declared Ukraine a success
story of his Freedom Agenda.
But the crisis had done little
more than solidify the political
structure Ukrainians had meant to
overthrow. A country that had al
ways been divided between an in
dustrial eastern half with historical
and linguistic ties to Russia and a
largely agricultural western half
that leaned more towards Europe
now saw that division etched per
manently into its electoral politics.
Caught between Western gov
ernments that wanted liberaliza
tion, a Russian state focused on
opaque economic deal-making and
the populist demands of then* con
stituents, Ukrainian political par
ties lost their ideological distinc
tions and resorted to regional and
nationalist identities that allowed
them the political space for these
complex maneuvers.
Each party was really three par
ties in one: a liberal face for the
West, a personally charismatic and
identity-based face for the voters
and an oligarchic core modeled off of
Putin's Russia. And while Prime
Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, the
leader of the Orange Revolution
protests, pioneered this model with
her Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc (now the
Fatherland Party), nobody was bet
ter at it than Viktor Yanukovych's
Party of Regions.

So despite Western handwring
ing and the very real irony of it all,
Yanukovych's reappearance on the
scene didn't represent a rejection of
the changes the Orange Revolution
brought to Ukrainian politics as
much as their consummation. And
despite the looming feeling that a
political system predicated on play
ing Europe, Russia and the Ukrain
ian people off each other couldn't
possibly last forever, Chekalkin was
right to perceive that the possibility
of autocracy looked distressingly
likely.
It took a series of missteps last
year to upset this equilibrium, first
on Europe's part and then on Russi
a's. European leaders assumed that
Yanukovych's repeated expressions
of Ukraine's desire for closer Euro
pean integration were honest and
unreserved, and they decided that
they could safely add more condi
tions to a proposed EU-Ukraine As
sociation Agreement.
When Yanukovych announced
the suspension of the Association
Agreement talks in November, it
was at first established opposition
parties that called for protests in
Kiev, especially the Fatherland Par
ty (effectively led by Arseniy Yat
senyuk, as Yanukovych had impris
oned Tymoshenko for the same sort
of corruption he regularly engaged
in) and UDAR, led by former boxer
Vitaly Klitschko.
But then something different
happened: The protest movement
in Kiev's Maidan Nezalezhnosti
square catapulted entirely new po
litical forces to the fore. Citizen
committees organized under the
Maidan banner took over local
and national government offices,
and citizen militias carried out the
functions of the police in its ab
sence.
When Russia miscalculated, as
suming that a customs agreement
of their own, coupled with a Ukrain
ian government crackdown, would
be enough to return Kiev to "nor
mal" politics, Yanukovych was
forced to accept defeat. This took
the form of a peace agreement and
a transition framework negotiated
with the opposition parties and
pressed for by both European and
Russian diplomats.
This weekend the Maidan had
the last laugh, as the transition
agreement already humiliating
for Yanukovych collapsed and
the president was forced to flee
Kiev for a safe haven in Crimea (by
