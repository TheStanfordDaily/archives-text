## Revolution in Ukraine: Take Two 
### James Bradbury 
UT n order to cut electricity
I consumption, it has been de
-Lcided to switch off the light
at the end of the tunnel." Such was
Ukrainian comedian Dmytro
Chekalkin's line upon the 2010 inau
guration of President Viktor
Yanukovych.
After a decade of failed reform
and economic collapse under the
first two post-Soviet leaders and an
other decade of political chaos
(there are Wikipedia articles on the
"2006 Ukrainian political crisis," the
"2007 Ukrainian political crisis" and
the "2008 Ukrainian political cri
sis") under a succession of govern
ments that promised much and de
livered little, the presidential elec
tions had gone to the very man who
had tried and failed to steal that
same office six years earlier.
The events of 2004 known as
the Orange Revolution repre
sented a hope that the power of the
people could bring down Ukraine's
oligarchic and corrupt political
structure and replace it with a
Western-style democracy. Peaceful
street protests forced the rigged
elections to be rerun under close in
ternational scrutiny, and President
Bush declared Ukraine a success
story of his Freedom Agenda.
But the crisis had done little
more than solidify the political
structure Ukrainians had meant to
overthrow. A country that had al
ways been divided between an in
dustrial eastern half with historical
and linguistic ties to Russia and a
largely agricultural western half
that leaned more towards Europe
now saw that division etched per
manently into its electoral politics.
Caught between Western gov
ernments that wanted liberaliza
tion, a Russian state focused on
opaque economic deal-making and
the populist demands of then* con
stituents, Ukrainian political par
ties lost their ideological distinc
tions and resorted to regional and
nationalist identities that allowed
them the political space for these
complex maneuvers.
Each party was really three par
ties in one: a liberal face for the
West, a personally charismatic and
identity-based face for the voters
and an oligarchic core modeled off of
Putin's Russia. And while Prime
Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, the
leader of the Orange Revolution
protests, pioneered this model with
her Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc (now the
Fatherland Party), nobody was bet
ter at it than Viktor Yanukovych's
Party of Regions.

So despite Western handwring
ing and the very real irony of it all,
Yanukovych's reappearance on the
scene didn't represent a rejection of
the changes the Orange Revolution
brought to Ukrainian politics as
much as their consummation. And
despite the looming feeling that a
political system predicated on play
ing Europe, Russia and the Ukrain
ian people off each other couldn't
possibly last forever, Chekalkin was
right to perceive that the possibility
of autocracy looked distressingly
likely.
It took a series of missteps last
year to upset this equilibrium, first
on Europe's part and then on Russi
a's. European leaders assumed that
Yanukovych's repeated expressions
of Ukraine's desire for closer Euro
pean integration were honest and
unreserved, and they decided that
they could safely add more condi
tions to a proposed EU-Ukraine As
sociation Agreement.
When Yanukovych announced
the suspension of the Association
Agreement talks in November, it
was at first established opposition
parties that called for protests in
Kiev, especially the Fatherland Par
ty (effectively led by Arseniy Yat
senyuk, as Yanukovych had impris
oned Tymoshenko for the same sort
of corruption he regularly engaged
in) and UDAR, led by former boxer
Vitaly Klitschko.
But then something different
happened: The protest movement
in Kiev's Maidan Nezalezhnosti
square catapulted entirely new po
litical forces to the fore. Citizen
committees organized under the
Maidan banner took over local
and national government offices,
and citizen militias carried out the
functions of the police in its ab
sence.
When Russia miscalculated, as
suming that a customs agreement
of their own, coupled with a Ukrain
ian government crackdown, would
be enough to return Kiev to "nor
mal" politics, Yanukovych was
forced to accept defeat. This took
the form of a peace agreement and
a transition framework negotiated
with the opposition parties and
pressed for by both European and
Russian diplomats.
This weekend the Maidan had
the last laugh, as the transition
agreement already humiliating
for Yanukovych collapsed and
the president was forced to flee
Kiev for a safe haven in Crimea (by
now the Moscow suburbs, if
recent reports are correct).
Parliament voted to release
Tymoshenko from prison,
and the vast presidential
palace that had been
Yanukovych's personal fief
dom was opened to the pub
lic, revealing, among other
things, a sizable personal
zoo.
Any of the dozen things
that have happened since
last Saturday, or the dozen
challenges that Ukraine now
faces, would merit its own
column but I'll merely
mention a few.
Yatsenyuk is now prime

minister, while Klitschko is a
leading candidate in the
presidential elections sched
uled for May. If Klitschko
wins (and Tymoshenko may
also run), will their relation
ship be more productive
than the famously ill-tem
pered partnership of Viktor
Yushchenko as President
and Tymoshenko as Prime
Minister that doomed the
Orange Revolution?
What will happen to
Ukraine's economy? The
West will not provide as sub
stantial of a financial assis
tance package as Russia of
fered in December, in part
because of the anti-bailout
and anti-foreign aid attitude
that now prevails in Europe
and the U.S., but also be
cause much of the money
would simply be funneled

straight to Russia to pay
natural gas debts. But if a
pro-Western government
takes power, it's likely that
Ukraine will lose significant
amounts of Russian trade
and subsidies. Will IMF
loans and currency devalua
tion (ironically a tool that's
denied to struggling Euro
pean countries) be enough to
tide Ukraine over, and will
the Association Agreement
actually lead to enough Eu
ropean trade to put
Ukraine's economy on a per
manently stronger footing?
Might China become a more
important economic and po
litical partner instead?
What about Ukraine's
territorial integrity? An ac
tual civil war or Russian mil
itary intervention looks un
likely. But will the Crimea

the semiautonomous, ma
jority-Russophone Black
Sea peninsula that hosts
much of the Russian Navy
become a de facto inde
pendent Russian satellite
like South Ossetia or Abk
hazia?
And what about
Ukraine's political land
scape? Will the radical new
local politics the Maidan
has built in certain
places distressingly right
wing, but everywhere im
pressively grassroots
survive the next decade of
political maneuvering? If so,
perhaps the Ukrainian peo
ple have indeed found the
light switch for the post-So
viet tunnel.
