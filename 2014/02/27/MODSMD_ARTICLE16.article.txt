# A 						White House of Cards
## 
### Uttara Sivaram 
Campus has been unusual
ly quiet for the past two
weeks. It would make
sense to chalk it up to a pro
tracted midterm season, but I
have a feeling (and a Facebook
newsfeed to back it up) that
Netflix's release of the entire
second season of House of Cards
has something to do with it
heck, I even updated Microsoft
Silverlight for the occasion.
Indeed, I'd be a little suspi
cious of anyone who clamed
immunity to Frank Under
wood's honeyed Southern
charm, which is why I've decid
ed to pay homage to this fiction
al icon. So with my consider
able power as a Stanford Daily
columnist, I've arranged for a
little meeting between two of the
■most powerful people to grace
our laptop screens and our na
tion.
Frank Underwood, meet Presi
dent Barack Obama.
NOTE: This is best enjoyed with
a little imagination and a slow,
syrupy South Carolinian accent.
Barack Obama knocks on
the front door of a small, state
ly townhouse somewhere in
D.C. The door opens and Oba
ma is standing face-to-face
with Frank Underwood.
UNDERWOOD: Mr. President,
how nice of you to visit.
OBAMA: Prank. Good to see
you. Beautiful home.
UNDERWOOD: Oh, it does its
job. Come on in, Mr. President.
OBAMA: Call me Barack.
UNDERWOOD: Maybe after a
few drinks, Mr. President. Now,
what can I help you with? Actually,
let's start with what I can't help you
with, because that'll go by a lot
faster.
OBAMA: Listen, Frank

UNDERWOOD: I can't help you
with your Healthcare.gov website. I
have absolutely no idea how the In
ternet works, which is why I hire
people who know people who can
make a damn website. My God, man
if a Harvard dropout who would
n't know a bespoke suit if he saw one
can create Facebook, I'm pretty
sure my 15-year-old neighbor can
make a better healthcare website.
OBAMA: Agreed, but I've got
my best guys on it.
UNDERWOOD: I'm pretty sure
you just have Sasha and Malia on it,
bless them, because they probably
set up your Linkedln profile for you
a year ago and you were impressed.
Speaking of, I also can't help you get
that dog of yours to look more pho
togenic in pictures. I mean, I can get
rid of the dog if you'd like. It's just
such a poor choice of pet.
OBAMA: Is that all?
UNDERWOOD: Yes. I can prob
ably help you with anything else at
this point, since I've wielded more
power from my bathtub than you
currently do in the Oval Office.
OBAMA: Right now I'm con
cerned about Karzai if he doesn't
sign the Bilateral Security Agree
ment soon, we'll lose useful territory
in the Middle East when he leaves
office.
UNDERWOOD: Karzai is never
leaving office he's moving next
door to the Presidential palace once
his term is over. He's holding onto
the last ace in his hand the BSA
to give himself a little leverage.
So hit him where it hurts.
OBAMA: Iraq?
UNDERWOOD: Family. He's
got his little brother, Abdul Qayum
Karzai, up to bat for the coming
elections. Make sure he knows we
won't stand by a nepotistic, fixed
election. Unless, of course, he
signs the BSA, at which point
we "get distracted."
OBAMA: I don't plan on
working with Karzai after his
term expires it's a waste
of time. Plus, I really do hate
the guy.
UNDERWOOD: Don't.
Invite him over to the resi
dence, you and Michelle, for
some BBQ ribs and sweet
tea. He's in for the long haul.
OBAMA: Ribs, Frank?
Really?
UNDERWOOD: Exactly
Shake with your right hand,
but hold a rock in your left.
OBAMA: Weil, in this
case, a pork rib.
UNDERWOOD: Less po
etic, but fine.
OBAMA: How about sur
veillance reform? It's one of
the biggest issues pulling my
approval numbers down.
UNDERWOOD: I'm a
huge fan of what you've done
with the NSA. Claire and I
look through phone records
during breakfast. Sometimes
we just check each other's
phone records instead of com
municating.
OBAMA: The American
people don't like it, and I can't
blame them. Plus, I made a
promise to find an alternative
during my State of the Union
speech
UNDERWOOD: Which
was tame, by the way. I was
able to paint half my Civil
War diorama while listening
to it that's how boring it
was.
OBAMA: Fine, but what
am I supposed to do about
UNDERWOOD: Just get
some private phone compa
nies on the phone, tell them to
keep the records we make
and allow the government to
periodically search them.
OBAMA: How do we
know the phone companies
will agree to comply with our
orders when we need them?
UNDERWOOD: It's the
government, Mr. President,
not the AT&T CEO's daugh
ter who wants to check her
boyfriend's phone record. If
the Pentagon asks them to
bend for national security
purposes, they will. And if

they don't, make sure you
store the records with multi
ple companies.
OBAMA: Edward Snow
den.
UNDERWOOD:
Should've gotten rid of him
years ago. Blame it on the
Chinese.
OBAMA: He's a thorn in
my side, Frank. He under
mines every move I make in
good faith.
UNDERWOOD: Even
Achilles was only as strong as
his heel. Find away to make
Snowden disappear. He's not
"opening the debate about na
tional security and privacy."
He's opening the floodgates
of the Potomac to watch the
White House drown.
OBAMA: That's a little
dramatic, don't you think?
UNDERWOOD: Mr.
President, have you even
seen my show?
OBAMA: I have, and I
gotta say, Frank I'm very
glad you're fictional.
UNDERWOOD: Me too.
If you're the president reality
has to offer, then I'd rather
just stay with Netflix.
OBAMA: I don't have
much time left in office,
Frank. I know I've been dis
appointing, but it hasn't been
an easy eight years. I inherit
ed a terrible economy and a
pack of vengeful Republicans
that don't want to do anything
but tear me down.
UNDERWOOD: Well, I
inherited high cholesterol, a
weakness for sweet tea and a
mild intolerance for lactose.
So I run, drink more sweet
tea and forbid milk from com
ing within a 10-foot radius
from my office.
OBAMA: Not sure if
that's relevant.
UNDERWOOD: Me nei
ther, I think I'm just hungry.
Point is, you've got a Con
gress that's so rogue it would
put that crazy tiger in India to
shame. And you've showed
your frustration, you've
kicked doors, you've belittled
them in speeches but you
haven't drawn blood. Or at
least, when you have, they've
drawn yours as well.
OBAMA: Bills need to get
passed, Frank. It's a matter of
diplomacy.
UNDERWOOD: In
Gaffney, we have our own
brand of diplomacy
OBAMA: We're not in
Gaffney, Frank, so whatever
crazy saying you have about
holding rocks and shaking
hands and drawing blood isn't
going to cut it.
UNDERWOOD: Fine,
Barack, FINE. You have
Iran's disarmament bill you
have to get past Congress
and the P6. Don't mess this
one up by doing something as
stupid as hosting another
damn fundraiser with Jay-Z

and Beyonce instead of meet
ing with Netanyahu. Get Re
publican staffers to the table,
brief the senators about what
happened in Geneva and
don't you dare lift one sanc
tion — Iran hasn't shown a
single act of good faith.
OBAMA: I think I liked it
better when you called me
"Mr. President."
UNDERWOOD: I think I
don't like you either way. But
if there's one thing for sure,
you are not going to spend the
rest of your presidency as the
lame duck you have been for
the past six years. You can fix
this.
OBAMA: Thanks for the
drink, Frank.
UNDERWOOD: Come
back again when Claire's
home. You like ribs, right?
OBAMA: Love 'em.
UNDERWOOD: Well
now, that's a great step in the
right direction.
