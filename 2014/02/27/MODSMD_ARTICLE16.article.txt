# A
						White House of Cards
## 
### Uttara Sivaram 
Campus has been unusual
ly quiet for the past two
weeks. It would make
sense to chalk it up to a pro
tracted midterm season, but I
have a feeling (and a Facebook
newsfeed to back it up) that
Netflix's release of the entire
second season of House of Cards
has something to do with it
heck, I even updated Microsoft
Silverlight for the occasion.
Indeed, I'd be a little suspi
cious of anyone who clamed
immunity to Frank Under
wood's honeyed Southern
charm, which is why I've decid
ed to pay homage to this fiction
al icon. So with my consider
able power as a Stanford Daily
columnist, I've arranged for a
little meeting between two of the
â– most powerful people to grace
our laptop screens and our na
tion.
Frank Underwood, meet Presi
dent Barack Obama.
NOTE: This is best enjoyed with
a little imagination and a slow,
syrupy South Carolinian accent.
Barack Obama knocks on
the front door of a small, state
ly townhouse somewhere in
D.C. The door opens and Oba
ma is standing face-to-face
with Frank Underwood.
UNDERWOOD: Mr. President,
how nice of you to visit.
OBAMA: Prank. Good to see
you. Beautiful home.
UNDERWOOD: Oh, it does its
job. Come on in, Mr. President.
OBAMA: Call me Barack.
UNDERWOOD: Maybe after a
few drinks, Mr. President. Now,
what can I help you with? Actually,
let's start with what I can't help you
with, because that'll go by a lot
faster.
OBAMA: Listen, Frank

UNDERWOOD: I can't help you
with your Healthcare.gov website. I
have absolutely no idea how the In
ternet works, which is why I hire
people who know people who can
make a damn website. My God, man
if a Harvard dropout who would
n't know a bespoke suit if he saw one
can create Facebook, I'm pretty
sure my 15-year-old neighbor can
make a better healthcare website.
OBAMA: Agreed, but I've got
my best guys on it.
UNDERWOOD: I'm pretty sure
you just have Sasha and Malia on it,
bless them, because they probably
set up your Linkedln profile for you
a year ago and you were impressed.
Speaking of, I also can't help you get
that dog of yours to look more pho
togenic in pictures. I mean, I can get
rid of the dog if you'd like. It's just
such a poor choice of pet.
OBAMA: Is that all?
UNDERWOOD: Yes. I can prob
ably help you with anything else at
this point, since I've wielded more
power from my bathtub than you
currently do in the Oval Office.
OBAMA: Right now I'm con
cerned about Karzai if he doesn't
sign the Bilateral Security Agree
ment soon, we'll lose useful territory
in the Middle East when he leaves
office.
UNDERWOOD: Karzai is never
leaving office he's moving next
door to the Presidential palace once
his term is over. He's holding onto
the last ace in his hand the BSA
to give himself a little leverage.
So hit him where it hurts.
OBAMA: Iraq?
UNDERWOOD: Family. He's
got his little brother, Abdul Qayum
Karzai, up to bat for the coming
elections. Make sure he knows we
won't stand by a nepotistic, fixed
