# "Don't waste your breath, they won't do anything anyway"

This is the third and final
piece in a series on life in
Israel and Palestine, in
conjunction with Israeli
Apartheid Week. You can read
part one and part two online.
"Don't waste your breath, they
won't do anything anyway."
These were the (translated)
words of a 94-year-old woman liv
ing in East Jerusalem, whose fami
ly is being kicked out of their home
by Israeli settlers and the Israeli
government. In 2001 these settlers
evicted the al-Kurds from the front
portion of their home claiming it
belonged to Jews occupying the
house and forcing the family to live
in the back.
The al-Kurds have been living
in the house, which was given to
them under the United Nations
Relief and Works Agency (UNR
WA), since 1956. They had initially
become refugees in 1948, when,
fearing violence against them
selves, they fled their home in
Haifa (which is now part of Israel)
as refugees to East Jerusalem
at that time, under the control of
Jordan.
Over the years, settlers have
used dogs to intimidate and harm
members of the family including
Maysa al-Kurd, the 54-year-old
daughter of the family. The al-
Kurds said that settlers would ex
pose themselves and perform oth
er indecent acts in front of the
women of the family, forcing them
to permanently hang up towels and
laundry in front of their windows.
In 2008, an Israeli court ruled
that the house belonged to
Sephardic Jews when the Ot
tomans controlled Palestine and
ordered the family out. This fami
ly's case was the first time in Is
raeli history where the judge came
to a house and took the keys away
from a family.
Muhammad al-Kurd, the owner
of the house, died of a massive
coronary attack two weeks after
the ruling. The family is still fight
ing the eviction to this day, with ev
idence in hand that the Ottoman
era document showed that
Sephardic Jews rented, but did not
own, the house. As symbols of a
greater issue, the al-Kurds have
spoken countless times to delega

tions from around the world.
The eviction of the al-Kurds is
not even the only one in the Sheikh
Jarrah neighborhood by 2009,
28 families had been evicted, leav
ing over 60 people homeless. In
December 2012, the Israeli court
evicted another family, leaving an
additional ten people homeless, in
cluding six children.
Listening to this family pour
out their suffering to us didn't sit
right with me, and when we got on
the bus to return to our hotel I un
derstood why.
A Palestinian member of our
delegation got on the microphone
and translated something he heard
the 94-year-old mutter over and
over again in Arabic to her daugh
ter during the presentation: "Don't
waste your breath, they're not go
ing to do anything anyway."
And it really didn't feel like
there was anything we could do for
this woman and her family beyond
relay the story back home. Sydney
Levy, a national member of Jewish
Voice for Peace and one of our del
egation leaders, told us later that
night that the woman was right
that we were not going to get this
woman's house back.
"She has every right to feel
hopeless because of what she's
seen and what she's experienced.
Your job is to take that feeling and
move yourself into action. Your job
is not to feel hopeless," Levy said.
"Our job is to convey messages of
hopelessness here, not so people at
home feel hopeless, but so they can
be moved to do something."
I wished I could tell this woman
that we were doing something. In
deed, many of us are working on
various campaigns to end the occu
pation from campuses and commu
nity organizations around the
United States. And speaking for
myself and Students for Justice in
Palestine at Stanford, we will not
stop until justice is realized for
people across Palestine and Israel.
I had asked during the question
and answer session: What can we
do to be the m.ost helpful to the
family. The answer of Maysa was
a new one to me: Get your legis
lators and your president to
end these injustices.
"The United States opposes all
unilateral actions, including West

Bank settlement activity and hous
ing construction in East Jerusalem,
as they complicate efforts to re
sume direct, bilateral negotiations,
and risk prejudging the outcome of
those negotiations," the U.S. State
Department declared last Decem
ber. "This includes building in the
E-l area as this area is particular
ly sensitive and construction there
would be especially damaging to
efforts to achieve a two-state solu
tion ... We have made clear to the
Israeli Government that such ac
tion is contrary to U.S. policy."
As someone skeptical of the
electoral and diplomatic process,
this suggestion was new to me. We
try many things in our campus
work, but reaching out to legisla
tors has not been one of them.
While the position of the United
States government on the settle
ments is clear, its willingness to
hold to account its "greatest ally
in the Middle East" is not. Presi
dent Obama, who demanded a full
freeze to settlement construction
as a condition for peace talks in
2009, has allowed his Secretary of
State John Kerry to pursue peace
talks today without this condition.
In fact, Israel has tendered over
5,000 settlement contracts in the
West Bank and East Jerusalem
since the talks began in August.
Yet having heard this call to ac
tion from someone who is directly
and seriously affected by the occu
pation, I commit to putting this in
my arsenal of tools to contribute
my part. I also challenge my peers,
who if they have read this far now
know of another person's oppres
sion and its direct connection to
U.S. students and taxpayers, not to
let this woman's prediction ring
true.
Kristian is co-president of
Stanford Students for Justice
in Palestine. He invites any
one interested in continuing
this conversation to hear
Palestinian activist and Stan
ford alumni Fadi Quran 'lO
dismiss the movement for jus
tice in the region tonight at
7:15 p. m. in the Ujamaa House
Drake Lounge.
