## Chasing a championship Cardinal seeks first conference title in history 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
Although the No. 23 Stan
ford wrestling team (17-5)
finished its dual season with
a close 20-19 loss to North
western, it set a new record
for most single-season dual
wins in program history. Af
ter having done so, it will
look to continue to chase his
tory this Sunday when it
seeks the first conference ti
tle in program history as it
hosts the Pac-12 Champi
onship at Maples Pavilion
this Sunday.
"This is our qualifier, so
individuals will qualify
through this to get to the na
tional tournament," said
head coach Jason Borrelli to
Stanford Athletics. "We
want to have some great in
dividual performances, but
we're not overlooking the
team concept... We've never
won a conference champi
onship here at Stanford in
wrestling, and we've posi
tioned ourselves very nicely
to have a chance to do that,
so we're excited for it."
The Cardinal has been
led this year by two-time
Ail-American and co-captain
Ryan Mango, who is the
llth-ranked wrestler in the

country in his weight class
and has contributed a 25-3
record this season, having
started at 133 pounds in all
but one of Stanford's duals
this season. The fifth-year
senior will ride into the
championship on a nine
match winning streak and
will look to qualify for the
NCAA Championship for
the fourth time in his career.
Sunday will mark the final
time that Mango will com
pete in front of the home
crowd at Stanford as a long
and illustrious collegiate ca
reer draws to a close.
"It's nice to have our
selves positioned to win a
conference championship
and for him to be in position
to win an individual national
title in his senior year," Bor
relli said. "He's a dynamic
kid, he's exciting, he scores a
lot of points and he's just
been really special for our
program and so hopefully
everybody will come out and
watch him in his last home
competition."
Junior Evan Silver, who
is ranked 12th in the 125-
pound class and led the team
with 26 wins last season, fol
lowed up his fantastic sopho
more season with a 20-4
record in his junior year and
will be looking to qualify for
his second consecutive
NCAA Championship. Last
season, he finished second in
the Pac-12 Championship in
Tempe, Ariz, and will look to
have an edge on Sunday be

cause of that experience.
In addition, 19th-ranked
senior Dan Scherer will
start at 197 pounds after
having finished the dual sea
son with an 18-4 record.
Scherer, 174-pound Kyle
Meyer, 149-pound Donovan
Halpin and Mango, as sen
iors, will look to provide vet
eran leadership to a relative
ly young Cardinal starting
lineup that features five
freshmen who redshirted
last season and will be com
peting on this stage for the
first time in their careers.
The young group is led by
sophomore 165-pound Jim
Wilson, who has shined en
route to a 30-6 record this
season after a team-high 15-
match win streak to start the
season.
Although Stanford looks
to make a strong showing on
Sunday due to its depth and
leadership, No. 17 Oregon
State, the only other ranked
team in the field, will also
figure to challenge the Car
dinal, particularly in the
middle weight classes, while
Boise State will look to pro
vide stiff competition in the
heavyweight classes.
The first session begins
at 10:30 a.m. on Sunday, the
second session begins at 3:30
p.m. and the championship fi
nals begin at 5 p.m. and will
be broadcast on the Pac-12

senior Dan Scherer will
start at 197 pounds after
having finished the dual sea
son with an 18-4 record.
Scherer, 174-pound Kyle
Meyer, 149-pound Donovan
Halpin and Mango, as sen
iors, will look to provide vet
eran leadership to a relative
ly young Cardinal starting
lineup that features five
freshmen who redshirted
last season and will be com
peting on this stage for the
first time in their careers.
The young group is led by
sophomore 165-pound Jim
Wilson, who has shined en
route to a 30-6 record this
season after a team-high 15-
match win streak to start the
season.
Although Stanford looks
to make a strong showing on
Sunday due to its depth and
leadership, No. 17 Oregon
State, the only other ranked
team in the field, will also
figure to challenge the Car
dinal, particularly in the
middle weight classes, while
Boise State will look to pro
vide stiff competition in the
heavyweight classes.
The first session begins
at 10:30 a.m. on Sunday, the
second session begins at 3:30
p.m. and the championship fi
nals begin at 5 p.m. and will
be broadcast on the Pac-12
Networks.
