## Stanford in Washington offers art track Programming builds on existing cultural offerings 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
The Bing Stanford in Washing
ton (SIW) program's new arts
track, offered for the first time this
quarter, has built on existing offer
ings while offering the potential for
further expansions in scope in the
future, according to involved facul
ty and administrators.
According to program director
Adrienne Jamieson, the SIW pro
gram has always sought to inte
grate art into the cumulative stu
dent experience.
"There's always been a good
and long tradition of arts and cul
ture in Washington," Jamieson
said. "Washington has an enormous
array of art institutions. In addition
to the internships and coursework,
[the track] includes going to muse
ums, field trips, historic fieldtrips
and cultural sites."
Historically, winter quarter was
the only quarter during which stu
dents could focus on specified con
centrations within the SIW pro
gram.
"We're providing a very specific
arts track to really provide an en
hanced experience along with dedi
cating coursework," Jamieson said,
referencing current offerings such
as one class about art and the First
Amendment and another about the
history of modern art.
In addition to coursework, the
program also offers appropriate
cultural events, such as a recently
concluded two-day trip to New
York focused on watching plays and
exploring exhibits in the city.
At the moment, seven students
in Washington are participants in
the track.
Rob Franklin 'l5, a political sci
ence major, expressed his apprecia
tion for the opportunity.
"I'm engaging what was just a
casual interest in the arts," he said,
adding that the track's creation had
played a role in his decision to ap
ply to SIW "It's something I enjoy
learning about, about something
I've never known and only had an
interest in non-academically."
The establishment of the arts
track is part of an overall Stanford
effort to make arts more accessible
to students, according to Richard
Meyer, professor of arts and art
history and faculty chair of the arts
track at SIW
"The idea is that [this comes as]
Stanford on campus is making a
huge stride to place arts at the cen
ter for students not just art and
art history majors even for stu
dents that don't take art history
class," Meyer said. "It's really
about an education of the mind and
for every undergrad to understand
that the arts are an essential
part of education."
Meyer also cited the in
creased focus on the arts on
campus as a reason to em
phasize the arts beyond
campus as well.
"There's growing inter

est in curating and in the art
world in general as possible
professions," Meyer said.
"It's something that the stu
dents would like to be in
volved in. Why not provide
this opportunity?"
Although the Depart
ment of Art and Art Histo
ry has led the SIW arts
track so far, Meyer ex
pressed hope that other
departments, such as the
ater and performing arts,

English and history, will
assume a more prominent
role in organizing future
SIW programming.
"Washington has such
wonderful museums, the
program was already up
and running [and] Adri
enne was so receptive, [so]
we thought this was a nat
ural move to make," he
said.
Meyer emphasized the
ultimate objective of ensur

ing sustained and growing
interest in the track.

"Eventually we're hop
ing to get a larger body of
Stanford students who
want to have this extra intel
lectual experience," Meyer
said. "It's a really extraordi
nary opportunity to think
about art and society, and
art and politics together."
