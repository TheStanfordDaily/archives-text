# New initiative backs faculty diversity
## University joins peer institutions in effort 
### VANESSA OCHAVILLO DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Four of California's top research universities,
including Stanford, have joined forces in an effort
to increase the presence of underrepresented mi
norities among faculty in science, technology, engi
neering and mathematics (STEM) fields.
The California Alliance for Graduate Education
and the Professoriate a collaboration between
Stanford, UC-Berkeley, UCLA and Caltech
will directly feature input from the School of
Earth Sciences, the School of Engineering and
some departments within the School of Humani
ties and Sciences.
"The idea is for the four institutions to work to
gether to hopefully achieve something that each of
us can't get our arms around on an individual ba
sis," said Jerry Hams, associate dean for multicul
tural affairs and professor of geophysics at the
School of Earth Sciences.
The histoiy of the consortium
The collaboration was first proposed in 2010 by
Mark Richards, executive dean of the College of
Letters and Science at Berkeley, in an effort to
boost the faculty presence of underrepresented
groups including African Americans, Hispanic
Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives,
Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders to a lev
el commensurate with national demographics.
Currently, according to Harris, the "pipeline"
the process that begins with Ph.D. programs and
ends with professorship experiences less diver
sity at each step.
Richards initially reached out to Stanford seek
ing collaboration. After three years of collabora
tion, the National Science Foundation awarded the
alliance $2.2 million last September.
The grant, which will last until February 2017,
provides an opportunity for the participating uni
versities to share successful practices in recruiting
and retaining underrepresented minority groups.
It will also allow graduate students, post doctor
ates and faculty members at the four institutions to
network more regularly.
"A diverse group of smart people will tramp a

less diverse group of smart people," Harris said.
"Sometimes, people who are trained differently
will take a different approach to a complicated
problem. The interaction of these people together
will lead to a better solution."

Minority representation at Stanford
Tenea Nelson, assistant dean in the Office of
Multicultural Affairs at the School of Earth Sci
ences, is a member of the consortium's implemen
tation team. She said that she envisions the al

liance yielding increased mentorship programs,
scientific discussions and more research collabo
ration among the four institutions, and expressed
hope that the efforts will create a more supportive
professional community for underrepresented
minorities.
Currently, participation by underrepresented
minorities in the "pipeline" at Stanford remains
low According to Nelson, in the School of Earth
