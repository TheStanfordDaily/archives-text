# New initiative backs faculty diversity
## University joins peer institutions in effort 
### VANESSA OCHAVILLO DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Four of California's top research universities,
including Stanford, have joined forces in an effort
to increase the presence of underrepresented mi
norities among faculty in science, technology, engi
neering and mathematics (STEM) fields.
The California Alliance for Graduate Education
and the Professoriate a collaboration between
Stanford, UC-Berkeley, UCLA and Caltech
will directly feature input from the School of
Earth Sciences, the School of Engineering and
some departments within the School of Humani
ties and Sciences.
"The idea is for the four institutions to work to
gether to hopefully achieve something that each of
us can't get our arms around on an individual ba
sis," said Jerry Hams, associate dean for multicul
tural affairs and professor of geophysics at the
School of Earth Sciences.
The histoiy of the consortium
The collaboration was first proposed in 2010 by
Mark Richards, executive dean of the College of
Letters and Science at Berkeley, in an effort to
boost the faculty presence of underrepresented
groups including African Americans, Hispanic
Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives,
Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders to a lev
el commensurate with national demographics.
Currently, according to Harris, the "pipeline"
the process that begins with Ph.D. programs and
ends with professorship experiences less diver
sity at each step.
Richards initially reached out to Stanford seek
ing collaboration. After three years of collabora
tion, the National Science Foundation awarded the
alliance $2.2 million last September.
The grant, which will last until February 2017,
provides an opportunity for the participating uni
versities to share successful practices in recruiting
and retaining underrepresented minority groups.
It will also allow graduate students, post doctor
ates and faculty members at the four institutions to
network more regularly.
"A diverse group of smart people will tramp a

less diverse group of smart people," Harris said.
"Sometimes, people who are trained differently
will take a different approach to a complicated
problem. The interaction of these people together
will lead to a better solution."

Minority representation at Stanford
Tenea Nelson, assistant dean in the Office of
Multicultural Affairs at the School of Earth Sci
ences, is a member of the consortium's implemen
tation team. She said that she envisions the al

liance yielding increased mentorship programs,
scientific discussions and more research collabo
ration among the four institutions, and expressed
hope that the efforts will create a more supportive
professional community for underrepresented
minorities.
Currently, participation by underrepresented
minorities in the "pipeline" at Stanford remains
low According to Nelson, in the School of Earth


VICTOR XU/The Stanford Daily
Sciences, 12 of the 272 Ph.D.
candidates are underrepre
sented minority students.
There is one minority student
among the 75 post-doctorates
and two minority faculty mem
bers out of a total of 60.
The School of Engineering
faces the same problem, ac
cording to Noe Lozano, associ
ate dean for engineering diver
sity programs and another
member of the consortium's
implementation team.
According to Lozano, the
School of Engineering confers
an unusually high number of
Ph.D. degrees each year an
average of 300 degrees, com
pared to other schools that
award anywhere between 10
and 50.
There remains, however, a
clear imbalance in the distribu
tion of underrepresented mi
nority students. In 2012, of the
307 students who received
Ph.Ds in the School of Engi
neering, only two were African
American and three were His
panic. None were Native
American or Pacific Islander.
"We look like the nation at
the undergraduate level, but at
the Ph.D. level we're nowhere
near where we should be,"
Lozano said. "It's totally bi
modular two different
worlds."
Part of the problem, ac
cording to Lozano, is a dimin
ishing "talent pool" of domes
tic students from which the
School of Engineering is able
to dray forcing the School to
accept more international stu
dents into its Ph.D. programs.
"If we didn't have that [in
ternational component], we
would have bigger problems,"
Lozano said.
Although competition in
academia is extensive for all
students, regardless of race or
ethnicity it especially deters
underrepresented minorities
from considering professor
ship as a viable career option,
according to Jeremy Brown, a
fifth-year Ph.D. student and
one of the few minority stu

dents in the geophysics de
partment at the School of
Earth Sciences.
"There are not so many
jobs there, and the jobs that
you might want at like Har
vard or Stanford are very com
petitive," he said. "Being a mi
nority, you might feel like
you're not coming in at the
same level as other candi
dates."
Brown, who plans to work
at a private company in the en
ergy or gas industry after ob
taining his degree, framed the
path to professorship is a long
and stressful one and ex
plained that the alliance's goal
"to have people there that are
also going through that [who]
are minorities is a big deal."
"If I had that community, I
think it definitely would have
made a big difference for me
too," he added.

Four of California's top research universities,
including Stanford, have joined forces in an effort
to increase the presence of underrepresented mi
norities among faculty in science, technology, engi
neering and mathematics (STEM) fields.
The California Alliance for Graduate Education
and the Professoriate a collaboration between
Stanford, UC-Berkeley, UCLA and Caltech
will directly feature input from the School of
Earth Sciences, the School of Engineering and
some departments within the School of Humani
ties and Sciences.
"The idea is for the four institutions to work to
gether to hopefully achieve something that each of
us can't get our arms around on an individual ba
sis," said Jerry Hams, associate dean for multicul
tural affairs and professor of geophysics at the
School of Earth Sciences.
The histoiy of the consortium
The collaboration was first proposed in 2010 by
Mark Richards, executive dean of the College of
Letters and Science at Berkeley, in an effort to
boost the faculty presence of underrepresented
groups including African Americans, Hispanic
Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives,
Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders to a lev
el commensurate with national demographics.
Currently, according to Harris, the "pipeline"
the process that begins with Ph.D. programs and
ends with professorship experiences less diver
sity at each step.
Richards initially reached out to Stanford seek
ing collaboration. After three years of collabora
tion, the National Science Foundation awarded the
alliance $2.2 million last September.
The grant, which will last until February 2017,
provides an opportunity for the participating uni
versities to share successful practices in recruiting
and retaining underrepresented minority groups.
It will also allow graduate students, post doctor
ates and faculty members at the four institutions to
network more regularly.
"A diverse group of smart people will tramp a

less diverse group of smart people," Harris said.
"Sometimes, people who are trained differently
will take a different approach to a complicated
problem. The interaction of these people together
will lead to a better solution."

Minority representation at Stanford
Tenea Nelson, assistant dean in the Office of
Multicultural Affairs at the School of Earth Sci
ences, is a member of the consortium's implemen
tation team. She said that she envisions the al

liance yielding increased mentorship programs,
scientific discussions and more research collabo
ration among the four institutions, and expressed
hope that the efforts will create a more supportive
professional community for underrepresented
minorities.
Currently, participation by underrepresented
minorities in the "pipeline" at Stanford remains
low According to Nelson, in the School of Earth


VICTOR XU/The Stanford Daily
Sciences, 12 of the 272 Ph.D.
candidates are underrepre
sented minority students.
There is one minority student
among the 75 post-doctorates
and two minority faculty mem
bers out of a total of 60.
The School of Engineering
faces the same problem, ac
cording to Noe Lozano, associ
ate dean for engineering diver
sity programs and another
member of the consortium's
implementation team.
According to Lozano, the
School of Engineering confers
an unusually high number of
Ph.D. degrees each year an
average of 300 degrees, com
pared to other schools that
award anywhere between 10
and 50.
There remains, however, a
clear imbalance in the distribu
tion of underrepresented mi
nority students. In 2012, of the
307 students who received
Ph.Ds in the School of Engi
neering, only two were African
American and three were His
panic. None were Native
American or Pacific Islander.
"We look like the nation at
the undergraduate level, but at
the Ph.D. level we're nowhere
near where we should be,"
Lozano said. "It's totally bi
modular two different
worlds."
Part of the problem, ac
cording to Lozano, is a dimin
ishing "talent pool" of domes
tic students from which the
School of Engineering is able
to dray forcing the School to
accept more international stu
dents into its Ph.D. programs.
"If we didn't have that [in
ternational component], we
would have bigger problems,"
Lozano said.
Although competition in
academia is extensive for all
students, regardless of race or
ethnicity it especially deters
underrepresented minorities
from considering professor
ship as a viable career option,
according to Jeremy Brown, a
fifth-year Ph.D. student and
one of the few minority stu

dents in the geophysics de
partment at the School of
Earth Sciences.
"There are not so many
jobs there, and the jobs that
you might want at like Har
vard or Stanford are very com
petitive," he said. "Being a mi
nority, you might feel like
you're not coming in at the
same level as other candi
dates."
Brown, who plans to work
