### TIFFANY LAM 
Associate Professor of Me
chanical Engineering Allison
Okamura M.S. '96 Ph.D. 'OO is the
director of the Center for Design
Research's Collaborative Haptics
and Robotics in Medicine
(CHARM) Lab. As robot-assisted
surgery continues to grow in pop
ularity, The Daily sat down with
Okamura to discuss her work and
its implementation.
The Stanford Daily (TSD):
Where did you get the idea to use
robots in brain science?
Allison Okamura (AO): At
Johns Hopkins University, I
worked with patients with dam
age to the cerebellum, something
[that is] notoriously difficult to
treat. A neuroscientist asked me
if we could use robotics as a tool to

understand the patient popula
tion and their deficits better.
In my research lab now, we de
sign minimally invasive robots to
reduce patient trauma and quick
en recovery time. We also aim to
interact with patients with
deficits or who need to be rehabil
itated using human gene inter
faces such as prosthetics or ro
bots that help people regain
movement.
TSD: What is the science behind it?
AO: There are two sides: ro
botic science and biological sci
ence. The science of robotics is
trying to understand how you op
timize a robot design and its con
trol system. With biological sci
ence in rehabilitation, you have to
understand the neuroscience of
the deficit what brain circuits
aren't working correctly and how

you can reconnect them through
training.
TSD: How long has it taken to de
velop this technology?
AO: The field of rehabilitation
robotics has been active for at
least 25 years. Commercial prod
ucts have existed for the last 15
years. Products like wearable ex
oskeletons are just starting to be
commercial products. Wearable
devices are very recent.
TSD: Has it been used on actual
humans before?
AO: Yes, on hundreds of pa
tients. There are a number of
commercial products. Companies
like Hocoma sell assistance ro
bots, while others sell robots that
apply forces to help with training,

"There are two sides:
robotic science and
biological science."

such as robots that patients
hold onto with their arms.
These products are being
used in many rehabilitation
centers and clinics.

TSD: How effective is robot
therapy?
AO: Robot therapy is cur
rently effective, although the
outcomes of current com
mercial products are not
very different from the out
comes of human therapists.
We believe rehab robots
have not done as much as
they could have, given the
capabilities of a robot, be
cause we don't completely
understand the neuroscience
behind these deficits.

TSD: How is this better than

other therapies?
AO: Robots can quantita
tively record objective data
by measuring positions and
forces, apply movements to
patients that human thera
pists can't and always
have power. However, it's not
that these robots are likely
to replace human therapists
or surgeons, but rather, they
are great tools that human
clinicians can use.

TSD: What are the chal
lenges?
AO: When a patient has a
stroke, he/she has potentially
damaged multiple parts of
the brain. Designing a ration
al therapy to help each indi
vidual patient is difficult. The
more we understand the neu
roscience behind it, the more
we will be able to use robots
to the best of their abilities to
cater to specific cases. In my
lab, we try to use the robots
not only for rehab strategies,
but also as neuroscience tools.
