Associate Professor of Me
chanical Engineering Allison
Okamura M.S. '96 Ph.D. 'OO is the
director of the Center for Design
Research's Collaborative Haptics
and Robotics in Medicine
(CHARM) Lab. As robot-assisted
surgery continues to grow in pop
ularity, The Daily sat down with
Okamura to discuss her work and
its implementation.
The Stanford Daily (TSD):
Where did you get the idea to use
robots in brain science?
Allison Okamura (AO): At
Johns Hopkins University, I
worked with patients with dam
age to the cerebellum, something
[that is] notoriously difficult to
treat. A neuroscientist asked me
if we could use robotics as a tool to

understand the patient popula
tion and their deficits better.
In my research lab now, we de
sign minimally invasive robots to
reduce patient trauma and quick
en recovery time. We also aim to
interact with patients with
deficits or who need to be rehabil
itated using human gene inter
faces such as prosthetics or ro
bots that help people regain
movement.
TSD: What is the science behind it?
AO: There are two sides: ro
botic science and biological sci
ence. The science of robotics is
trying to understand how you op
timize a robot design and its con
trol system. With biological sci
ence in rehabilitation, you have to
understand the neuroscience of
the deficit what brain circuits
aren't working correctly and how

you can reconnect them through
training.
TSD: How long has it taken to de
velop this technology?
AO: The field of rehabilitation
robotics has been active for at
least 25 years. Commercial prod
ucts have existed for the last 15
years. Products like wearable ex
oskeletons are just starting to be
commercial products. Wearable
devices are very recent.
TSD: Has it been used on actual
humans before?
AO: Yes, on hundreds of pa
tients. There are a number of
commercial products. Companies
like Hocoma sell assistance ro
bots, while others sell robots that
apply forces to help with training,

"There are two sides:
robotic science and
biological science."
