## 
### â€“ Kylie Jue 
Stanford researchers have identified an
elastic-like protein matrix called spectrin
that increases the stability of nerves that
sense touch.
According to a study published in "Na
ture Cell Biology" on Feb. 23, spectrin, a
protein that allows the bending of red blood
cells, also helps nerves to better withstand
natural wear-and-tear due to movement at
