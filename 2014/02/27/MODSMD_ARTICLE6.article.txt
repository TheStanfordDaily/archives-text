# Researchers identify nerve-stabilizing protein
## 
### â€“ Kylie Jue 
Stanford researchers have identified an
elastic-like protein matrix called spectrin
that increases the stability of nerves that
sense touch.
According to a study published in "Na
ture Cell Biology" on Feb. 23, spectrin, a
protein that allows the bending of red blood
cells, also helps nerves to better withstand
natural wear-and-tear due to movement at
joints and among tissues.
Primary researcher
Michael Krieg worked as a
postdoctoral fellow in the
labs of both Miriam Good
man, associate professor of
molecular and cellular physi
ology, and Alex Dunn, assis
tant professor of chemical en
gineering. Drawing on the
faculty members' specializa
tions in touch-sensing neu
rons and the physical proper
ties of cells (respectively),
Krieg combined his experi
ences to study the physical
properties of nerves that
sense touch.

By studying nerve re
silience in roundworms,
Krieg found that those that
lacked the protein spectrin
had buckling nerves that
broke over time. Worms with
mutations in spectrin were
less likely to react when
touched, and the researchers'
studies suggested that muta
tions in spectrin may be the
cause of movement disorders

in people as well.
In general, the research
resulted in two main findings
first, that spectrin forms
an elastic mesh beneath the
surface of nerve cells that en
ables bending and flexing
without preventing signals
from being sent and second,
that the spectrin matrix may
assist in transmitting signals
in touch-sensing nerves.
After further experimen
tation, Krieg also demon
strated that the spectrin ma
trix helps to maintain the ten
sion in nerves that allows
them to remain stable. Using
a tool developed by Dunn and
Goodman through funding
from Stanford Bio-X, Krieg
was able to measure the force
within cells at an extremely
precise level.
In the future, the re
searchers hope to apply their
work to nerve types beyond
those that sense touch and
want to determine the role of
spectrin in transmitting touch
itself. They also hope to apply
the findings to animals be
sides worms, and in particu
lar to human beings.
