## Green Living Council pilots dorm composting 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
The Green Living Council
(GLC) recently began a com
posting program within several
undergraduate residences, pro
viding compost bins in kitch
enette areas as well as Ziploc
sized re-sealable bags for each
resident to keep in their rooms.
The compost project, which
is being piloted in Alondra,
Ujaama, Trancos, Junipero
and Castano is one of three
GLC "Spreading Everyday
Environmentalism in Dorms"
(SEED) pilot initiatives debut
ing this quarter. The other two
initiatives feature efforts to re

duce the amount of paper tow
el waste and increase recycling
efforts.
According to Emma
Hutchinson 'l7, a GLC mem
ber and representative for
Roble Hall, baseline informa
tion about resident behavior
was collected last quarter. In
particular, Hutchinson and the
other members working on the
compost project analyzed the
percentage of compostable
waste that was thrown out in
the landfill.
According to the data col
lected from a random sampling
of dorms, an average of around
41 percent of the landfill trash
(by weight) that a resident gen

erates is compostable.
"We're taking into account
paper towels and napkins, and
compostable containers is a
huge [part of the landfill],"
Hutchinson said. "Food ven

postable containers and a lot
of people don't know those are
compostable."
This baseline information
will be used to comparatively
assess the results of the
GLC's efforts through the
end of the year, which the
group will present to the Of
fice of Sustainability as a po
tential model for a University
wide initiative.
"The data that we'll have
from pilot SEED initiatives
can be used for scaling these
projects up to the institu
tional level with help from
the Housing Department or
by the Office of Sustainabili
ty," said Sasha Brownsberg
er 'l4, co-president of the
Green Council.
Olivia Reyes-Becerra 'l7,
GLC member and represen
tative for Junipero, said that
the compost project has been
easy to advocate when talking
to peers in her dorm.
"I'm able to have conver
sations with people about sus
tainability and they're less
likely to be put off from being
sustainable and understand
that being green is part of
your everyday life," Reyes-
Becerra said. "Living there

allows me to show others this
is exactly how you do it. I'm
there as an example."
Linda Xiong 'l7, a resi
dent of Junipero, explained
that incorporating the use of
the compost bags would take
a while for her to get used to,
especially because she didn't
grow up with composting
habits at home.
"It's a little weird, and it's
more convenient to do it at
the dining hall because I have
to do it there," she said. "Ini
tially you have to make a con
scious decision to get the bag
gie and put the apple core or
the banana peel into it."
However, residents have
responded positively to the
composting efforts, accord
ing to both Hutchinson and
Reyes-Becerra.
"I'm emptying the com

post bin every three days
both bins basically two to
three times a week,"
Hutchinson said, adding that
so far Roble has generated
over 35 points of compost per
week.
While the compost project
has stalled well, Hutchinson
predicted some obstacles to
instilling environmentally
conscious behavior in her
dorm-mates.
"I'm anticipating that peo
ple will still be throwing out
paper towels and napkins.
That's also [compost], not
just food waste," Hutchinson
said. "But I'm generally
pleased with the response
rate at Roble. People have
been pretty responsive."
