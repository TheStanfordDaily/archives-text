"Seven Wonders of Physics"
Sometimes, nature illustrates the abstract ideas of physics and mathematics in beautiful ways, and the
ideas can be brought to life by simple demonstrations. My seven wonders each with a deep underlying
idea include the great moon-driven river wave, light interference magnified in rainbows, quantum
twists and turns, and the colour of gold.

"Hamilton's Diabolical Singularity"
Hamilton's first application of the concept of phase-space - later so fruitful in physics - was a
prediction in optics in 1831: conical refraction in biaxial crystals. This was one of the first successful
predictions of a qualitatively new phenomenon using mathematics, and created a sensation. At the
heart of conical refraction is a singularity, anticipating the geometric phase and the conical intersections
now studied in quantum chemistry and graphene. The light emerging from the crystal contains many
subtle diffraction details, whose definitive understanding and observation have been achieved only
recently. Generalizations of the phenomenon involve radically different mathematical structures.
