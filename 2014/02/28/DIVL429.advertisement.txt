The Ethics of Wealth: "Treasure in Heaven" —
The Implications of an Image with Peter Brown
&
Monday, March 3
7:30 pm
CEMEX Auditorium
Knight Management Center
(Zambrano Hall)
Stanford University
Free and open to the public
In this lecture, the eminent historian Peter Brown, Professor
of History, Emeritus, Princeton, will explore the wider social
and imaginative implications, for the Christian churches of late
antiquity, of the well known sayings of Christ that His followers
should place "treasure in heaven" by giving to the poor. Brown
will examine the imaginative logic of the various representations
of the poor in Latin Christianity, and how the highly polarized
representations of the poor produced by Christian discourse
have been responsible for mistaken views of the social
structure and economy of the late Roman Empire. Finally,
Brown will suggest the ways in which the phrase "treasure in
heaven" and related phrases taken from both the Old and the
New Testaments shaped attitudes to pious giving in the
socially differentiated Christian communities of the 4th- and
sth-century West.
The Ethics of Wealth series is a campus-wide initiative. Co-sponsors include
the McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society, Stanford Humanities Center,
Stanford Creative Writing Program, Stanford Summer Theater, the Art and
Art History Department, the Department of Religious Studies, and Stanford
Continuing Studies.
