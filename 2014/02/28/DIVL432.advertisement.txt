TUESDAY MARCH 4,2014 7:30PM
CUBBERLEY AUDITORIUM STANFORD UNIVERSITY
Co-sponsored by Immersion in the Arts: Living in Culture
(ITALIC) and The Stanford Storytelling Project
Join us for an evening of superb comedy with the deeply
funny Tig Notaro, a favorite and regular on Conan and on
public radio's This American Life. Her Grammy-nominated
sophomore album, LIVE, sold over 100,000 copies in just 6
weeks, which is unheard of for comedy albums today. She
has appeared in a number of television shows, most
notably as "Officer Tig" in The Sarah Silverman Program
and in the recent hit movie, In A World. These days, Tig
co-hosts the podcast Professor Blastoff, and performs
regularly at the Hollywood Improv, the UCB Theater, and
Largo at The Coronet Theater in her monthly show, Tig
Notaro and Friends... and of course, headlines festivals,
clubs, colleges, theaters, and living rooms across the
universe.
Funded in part by the generous support of the Stanford
Arts Institute.
Limited public seating: Doors will open for
SUID holders at 7:00PM, doors for Public at 7:15PM
