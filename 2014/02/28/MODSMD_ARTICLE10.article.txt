# BEHIND THE BACKPACK
## INSIDE THE LIVES OF STANFORD STUDENT-ATHLETES 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
"Tired. Pride in your school and in
yourself. Discipline in time, in your sport,
in going to bed." That's how Tate Murray, a
senior on the track and field team, described
her experience as a Stanford student-athlete.
"It's hard to put into words something
that you've worked your entire life for, that
has always been a dream, and to finally actu
ally be here and be one of the people on TV
that you've always looked up to, but now
you're the one wearing the jersey with 'Stan
ford' across your chest," said former women's
basketball player Toni Kokenis. "What that
means is so much bigger than ourselves,
which is just a really powerful feeling."
All student-athletes have their own sto

ries to tell, their own adversities they've
overcome, their own sets of sacrifices and
their own unique experiences that have
made all of the hard work worthwhile.
Most student-athletes have never had
an afternoon class. They've never been on
dorm ski trips. They can't make plans with
friends because their schedules are out of
their hands. They look forward to ice baths.
They give up the four or five years of their
collegiate experience to Stanford athletics
while they are still expected to meet the ex
pectations of Stanford academics. Waking up
early is second nature almost. Voluntary
practices are actually mandatory. Many have
to sacrifice studying abroad or make special
arrangements to do so. A suitcase, hotel and
the team bus become home during the sea
son, but don't be fooled into thinking that

the offseason is any easier.
"A student-athlete has to eat three
meals a day minimum," said sophomore
track athlete Steven Solomon. "They can't
miss a meal because that will affect them
athletically. It's not uncommon for me to be
up at six in the morning, go to a training ses
sion, go to breakfast, go to three hours of
classes in the morning and come back to my
room and my roommate is still sleeping."
The amount of time and commitment it
takes to be a full-time student and a full-time
athlete, especially at a top-tier school aca
demically and athletically like Stanford, can
not be underestimated. There is a lot more
to the students with the red backpacks than
what one might assume.
It's not just practice time and classes
that consume an athlete's day, either. Time

spent in the front and back ends of practice
adds up, and pulling an all-nighter is not nec
essarily an option when you have a 5:30 a.m.
lift the next morning.
"You don't realize how much time it
takes up," Murray said. "You don't just have
practice but [also] all the things that go with
that: doctor's appointments, going to the
training room, the travel, stuff like that."
A three-hour practice can turn into a
five-hour ordeal, and some athletes even add
on extra time to practice individually. Various
women's basketball players can be found in
the Arrillaga practice gym directly after a
game perfecting their shot and improving on
that night's performance.
But then there is the other side to being
a student-athlete.
Nike Christmas. The Athletic Academic
Resource Center. Pre-selected books waiting
in labeled bags at the bookstore. Traveling
around the country and sometimes out
side of it. Scholarships. Receiving a golf cart
and massages when injured. Networking.
Winning the Directors' Cup 19 years in a
row. Referring to non-student-athletes as

"NARPs" (non-athlete regular people) or
"regulars". Representing a successful pro
gram.
None of it comes without a price. Stan
ford student-athletes do not get priority for
choosing classes and don't have the special
dorms that other schools offer. Yes, there are
perks, but those perks are rewards for a lot
of hard work.
Overwhelmingly, the majority of stu
dent-athletes agreed that the greatest bene
fit of being a part of the Stanford athlete
community is the camaraderie, the ability to
relate to each other and the mutual respect
that athletes develop and have towards each
other.
"I just really love the guys on our team,"
said senior Austin Hack, a member of the
men's rowing team. "It's hard to compare it
to a non-student-athlete life because you
don't spend a lot of time suffering together."
It's easy for athletes to fall into that
sense of exclusivity or the "athlete bubble"
because of their common goals and struggles
in trying to achieve success both on the field
and in the classroom.

"The reason that our training partners
become such protagonist figures in our lives
is because we literally and figuratively live
and die by each other," Solomon said. "That
really sparks a kinship between two people
that is really special and isn't found in any
other kind of friendships."
"There's no other way that you could
conceive to build such a strong bond than by
working and toiling together," said junior
rower Kaess Smit. "If people ask me, 'Do
you enjoy rowing?', the actual process of
rowing and training is always miserable but
it's the fact that you're doing it with your
boys [that makes it enjoyable]."
However, there are added pressures
that come with the sport when student-ath
letes have to live up to Stanford's legacy of
athletic dominance. It's easy to buy into the
glory when they are walking advertisements
for Nike and are a part of a successful pro
gram. The pressure to uphold the Universi
ty's high standards in the classroom and the
training room is intense. All of these pres-

sures can warp the athletes' priori
ties.
"It's humbling to be surround
ed by all these athletes and the lega
cy of Stanford athletics while not
appreciating each individual athlete
at the same time you are a part
of the Stanford Athletics brand,"
one former Stanford athlete said to
The Daily. "It's too much about giv
ing things up for the team and the
program instead of doing anything
for yourself.
"Somewhere along the lines,
you buy into the identity without
knowing it and that's really danger
ous because the more you buy into
the identity, the more it controls
you," the athlete added. "A lot of
the athletes buy into the glory, and
that changes people."
Dealing with the politics in
volved in athlete-coach relations
and vying for playing time can be
stressful as well. Sometimes senior
ity is favored and sometimes ability
is the deciding factor, but ultimate
ly, the player only has so much influ

ence and say, even despite efforts
by coaches to make decisions seem
objective and not arbitrary.
In order to cope with it all, ath
letes are forced to quickly develop
their time management skills and
discipline. Some even admitted that
they get more schoolwork done
than they would've without playing
a sport because procrastination is
not an option with such a rigid
schedule and any minute not used
productively feels like a waste.
"I think that I am actually doing
better [in school] than I would [oth
erwise] just being on the team,"
said freshman volleyball player Clay
Jones. "That foundation and forti
tude kind of pushes me through my
school work and it teaches me time
management and I think it's more
beneficial than worse for me in my
academic life."

Despite athletes attending
graduate schools in engineering,
medicine and nursing, for example,
and working for venture capitalists
and the like during summer or the

offseason, the stereotype persists
that all athletes only got into Stan
ford because of their sport, can't
keep up with the course load or that
they use their sport as an excuse for
taking easy classes.
"Everyone had a unique path
to get here," said junior soccer play
er Haley Rosen. "Maybe I didn't
come in with the highest GPA or
SAT, but I'm sitting in the class
room, learning like anybody else in
class, and we're all equally capable
or else we wouldn't be here."

"It's also frustrating how stu
dents will think that student-ath
letes never would've gotten in here
without their sport," admitted an
other athlete. "[That] is probably
true, but what they don't under
stand is that all the hours that [ath
letes] put in high school into ex
tracurriculars and having time to
study and take extra classes. We put
all of that extra time and effort into
going to soccer practice every
night, missing school for tourna
ments, being gone every weekend.

[We] got in with our own hard work
in just a slightly different way."
And athletes, of course, must
take the same required classes and
unit loads as their peers in order to
earn a Stanford degree. In all, the
typical Stanford athlete does not
feel that he or she is so different

from the type and quality of student
that it takes to succeed at Stanford.

"I've learned by now that in
certain classes, I don't want to ap
pear as an athlete," one Cardinal
student-athlete said. "They look at
you and sometimes there's a sense
of, 'You're an athlete, maybe you're
not as intelligent.' I try my hardest
to disprove that, and it's pretty infu
riating."

Non-athletes may spend the
same amount of time on something
as an athlete spends on his or her
sport. However, athletes explain
that there is a difference between
the level of taxation and the rigidity
of their schedules and those of oth
er students.

Most students' experiences at
Stanford are defined by some job,
activity, volunteerism or other driv
ing force something more than
just attending classes. A sport is the
job, club, organization, extra units,
research and social scene of a non
athlete wrapped up into one all-con
suming commitment a commit
ment that most student-athletes
both love and hate at the same
time.

Senior basketball player Chiney
Ogwumike summed up the experi
ence for all when she said, "It's
challenging, yet rewarding."
