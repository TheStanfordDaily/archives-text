## THEATER Stanford Shakes brings Henry V to the modern era 
### KATIE STRAUB CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The final installation in a
tetralogy of monarchical his
tories, Henry V is the story
of the young and mighty
King Henry V of England
and his efforts to conquer
French lands at the bloody Battle
of Agincourt during the Hundred
Years' War. Sound like a history les
son?
It isn't.

Stanford Shakespeare Compa
ny's production dusts off the story
and casts it anew. Under the direc
tion of Louis McWilliams 'l6,
StanShakes modernizes the play
dramatically (pun intended), by
transforming the play from a 14th
century power struggle to a story
about the Vietnam War.
The move is clear from the
opening moments of the show

before, even. In fact, fist-pumping
tunes of Led Zeppelin and The
Who set the stage while audience
members file into their seats, and
the backdrop of the stage, before
any actors graced it, is a bare set of
wooden platforms draped with an
army green mesh. When actors do
take the stage, soldiers don rock
'n' roll T-shirts and roll bandanas
atop their heads, Henry and his

delegates wear suits, crisp trousers
and ties instead of ruffled collars,
and wartime longbows are re
placed by handgun props. To top it
off, real Vietnam war footage is
played, wheeled in on a projector,
in lieu of "fighting scenes."
In this heavy reinterpretation,
McWilliams encourages the audi
ence not only to engage with the
play, but also to identify with it.
Because we (one can assume)
identify more with Vietnam War
than the Hundred Years War, we
formulate more invested opinions
about the play's outcome with this
identifiably modern take. When
we watch British soldiers, por
trayed as kids in cargo and dog
tags, shuffle off to battle, we feel
for them because we can identify
them as real. When we witness
King Henry rally his men into war
("Once more onto the breach,
dear friends, once more...") and
they subsequently march into dan
ger, a surge of emotion grips us. In
stead of feeling distanced by pan
taloons and rapiers, we worry for
these characters as if they were
our own. Wait, we say, I know
these men! Will they make it?
We feel this way about the
British soldiers, and it offers a pow-
erful effect. The production may have slightly
undercut itself, however, in its portrayal of
the French royal family. While actors playing
the French felt real to a certain extent, there
were many moments in which the French
characters seem exaggerated, with excessive
French accents, affected cigarette smoking
and all-black outfits. It may be that these mo
ments were meant to serve as some comedic
relief, which is understandable: this is a pro
duction based on history, after all, and we
need comedy now and again. Several scenes
involving the delicate and childlike French
princess, Katherine (played by Becca Gold
'l5), were positively hilarious and rightly
served to break up dramatic tensions of the
plotline.

However, in making the French seem a
little less "real" than the British in this play,
some emotional impact was lost at the end.
When the British decimate the French in bat
tle, destroying them in catastrophic numbers,
the French cry for mercy, but we cannot take
them very seriously. A moment of empathy is

lost, even in a time of loss and sorrow.
For the most part, however, the produc
tion avoids gimmicks by showcasing an im
pressive amount of raw acting talent. The au
dience delighted in a strong and nuanced in
terpretation of King Henry, as Kevin Heller
'l6 turned from red-faced and shouting to
dimpled and charming in a mere pivot-turn;
Kevin Hurlbutt 'l4 as the Chorus tied the en
tire production together through a command
of verse, a creative interpretation of the text
and a non-affected ease in nature that made
him relatable in his direct audience address
es; Sunny Huang 'l4, portraying the Hostess
and Queen Isabel, meanwhile demonstrated
the range of a professional and forced tears
from every eye in the house in one heart
breaking look; and finally, the smart and tal
ented ensemble performed with a conviction
of truth fiercely felt.
The talented actors in this production
made the Shakespearean verse clearer and
more relatable than any translator could have
and that, one can argue, is the litmus test
of a good Shakespearean production. A well
done piece.
