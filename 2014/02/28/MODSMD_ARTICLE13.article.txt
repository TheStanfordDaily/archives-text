## THEATER Stanford Shakes brings Henry V to the modern era 
### KATIE STRAUB CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The final installation in a
tetralogy of monarchical his
tories, Henry V is the story
of the young and mighty
King Henry V of England
and his efforts to conquer
French lands at the bloody Battle
of Agincourt during the Hundred
Years' War. Sound like a history les
son?
It isn't.

Stanford Shakespeare Compa
ny's production dusts off the story
and casts it anew. Under the direc
tion of Louis McWilliams 'l6,
StanShakes modernizes the play
dramatically (pun intended), by
transforming the play from a 14th
century power struggle to a story
about the Vietnam War.
The move is clear from the
opening moments of the show

before, even. In fact, fist-pumping
tunes of Led Zeppelin and The
Who set the stage while audience
members file into their seats, and
the backdrop of the stage, before
any actors graced it, is a bare set of
wooden platforms draped with an
army green mesh. When actors do
take the stage, soldiers don rock
'n' roll T-shirts and roll bandanas
atop their heads, Henry and his

delegates wear suits, crisp trousers
and ties instead of ruffled collars,
and wartime longbows are re
placed by handgun props. To top it
off, real Vietnam war footage is
played, wheeled in on a projector,
in lieu of "fighting scenes."
In this heavy reinterpretation,
McWilliams encourages the audi
ence not only to engage with the
play, but also to identify with it.
Because we (one can assume)
identify more with Vietnam War
than the Hundred Years War, we
formulate more invested opinions
about the play's outcome with this
identifiably modern take. When
we watch British soldiers, por
trayed as kids in cargo and dog
tags, shuffle off to battle, we feel
for them because we can identify
them as real. When we witness
King Henry rally his men into war
("Once more onto the breach,
dear friends, once more...") and
they subsequently march into dan
ger, a surge of emotion grips us. In
stead of feeling distanced by pan
taloons and rapiers, we worry for
these characters as if they were
our own. Wait, we say, I know
these men! Will they make it?
We feel this way about the
British soldiers, and it offers a pow-
