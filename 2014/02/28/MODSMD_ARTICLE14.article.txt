# DOCUMENTARIES
## A 						look at this year's Oscar nominees 
### GILLIE COLLINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Though they employ diverse stories and forms to
convey their message, this year's Oscar-nomi
nated documentary features all explore the role
of art in contemporary society. Both "20 Feet
from Stardom" and "Cutie and the Boxer" ex
pose the working realities of the contemporary
art world, giving voice to relatively unheard artists.
Meanwhile, "The Act of Killing," "The Square" and
"Dirty Wars" challenge audiences to consider the
ethics and efficacy of art as a means of political ex
pression. While these films are not of universal quali
ty, they are, collectively, a reminder that art matters
and that films have an uncanny capacity to shape the
world they depict.
20 Feet from Stardom
In "20 Feet from Stardom," director Melvin
Neville shines a spotlight on the anonymous voices
behind famous musicians like Ray Charles, The
Rolling Stones, Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson.
The film puts back-up singers including Tata Vega
and Merry Clayton, Lisa Fischer and Judith Hill at
center stage, and the result is stunning, as their voices

soar and their stories inspire. David Lasley, who per
formed with James Taylor, sums up the plight of back
ground vocalists: "As a backup singer, they'd like you
to come in, make things sound great, take very little
credit and go home quickly!"

Neville's film features the stories of several
women who were unwilling to just "go home." The
film is never heavy-handed about its critique of gen
der and racial politics in the entertainment industry.
Instead, Neville lets the music speak or, rather,
sing for itself.

Cutie and the Boxer
Ushio and Noriko Shinohara met in New York in
the 1970'5. He was a 41-year-old avant-garde painter,
famous for his "action art." She was a 19-year-old art
student. Today, Ushio is 80, struggling to sell his
work, while Noriko strives to find her own artistic
voice. Zachary Heinzerling's film, "Cutie and the Box
er," is a portrait of their 40-year marriage.
The couple's relationship is still a work in
progress, influenced by ongoing financial pressures
and their competing creative ambitions. As Noriko
works on a graphic novel based on her relationship

with Ushio, romance and family
life become the materiality of her
work. Despite Noriko's creative
pursuits, nothing about her rela
tionship with Ushio conforms to
cartoon. "Cutie and the Boxer" is a
subtle, deft film about one cou
ple's love language the fights,
silences, paintings and dances at
the heart of their life together.

The Act of Killing
Anwar Congo and Herman
Koto are self-professed "gang
sters," former Indonesian paramil
itaries who helped perpetrate the
slaughter of at least half a million
people during Indonesia's 1965-66
massacres. In "The Act of Killing,"
director Joshua Oppenheimer en
courages Congo, Koto and their
compatriots to re-enact their four
decade-old killings, using costumes,
make up and special effects to de
pict their role in the atrocities.
"The Act of Killing" is a hor
ror film. It is also a formally innova
tive and excruciatingly provocative
documentary about the relation
ship between performance, mass
violence and memory. It is hard to
watch the perverse performances:
Congo pretends to suffocate a man
with wire and Koto dresses up as a
female victim. Their pageants re
semble surrealist musicals, West
erns and film noir dramas, raising
questions about the links between
"play" violence and actual atrocity.
That said, because the film
provides very little information on
the terms of Oppenheimer's rela

tionship with the "actors," the ex
tent to which Congo and Koto
were manipulated or, in fact, "di
rected" is unclear. The film is also
weak where it fails to adequately
contextualize the barbarism of
Congo and Koto: What were the
economic and political incentives
that drove their behavior? How, ex
actly, did the Indonesian army en
gage in its campaign of extermina
tion?

More broadly, I found myself
wondering whether Oppenheimer
was right to provide these men
with a platform to re-live their
memories (or fantasies) without
providing a clear historiography of
the conflict. Ultimately, though,
these questions are the heart of
the film's value: "The Act of
Killing" forces us to think about
our own position as an internation
al "audience," observing past and
present atrocities worldwide.

The Square
Jehane Noujaim's "The
Square" traces the experiences of
a handful of Egyptian demonstra
tors amidst the unfolding chaos of
the Arab Spring, from their protest
tent idealism and kitchen table po
litical debates to their violent en
counters with the armed forces.
While these characters have di
verse histories, what they share is
perseverance: they choose time
and again to risk their lives for free
dom and democracy.
The film is a sophisticated
evaluation of the revolution's out

comes. It exposes slippage be
tween idealism and naivety, as well
as the pitfalls of a "leaderless" po
litical movement. The camera
team is unafraid to ask difficult
questions, to shoot from the eye of
the storm in the midst of the con
flagration between demonstrators
and armed forces. In this sense,
Noujaim, her colleagues and her
characters are all revolutionaries,
capturing and elaborating the
ideals that exploded in Tahrir
Square three years ago.

Dirty Wars
"Dirty Wars" follows investiga
tive journalist Jeremy Scahill to the
frontlines of the War on Terror. Di
rected by Richard Rowley, the film
begins in 2010 in Gardez,
Afghanistan, after a raid by U.S.
forces results in the death of sever
al civilians. Scahill's subsequent in
vestigation of the Joint Special Op
erations Command takes him to
Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia
where, according to Scahill,
"somehow, before our eyes, unde
clared wars have been launched
across the world."

This film was the most disap
pointing of this year's Oscar nomi
nees. The documentary depended
largely on Scahill's narration, which
seemed, at times, melodramatic
and self-congratulatory. Some of
the scenes for instance, one in
which Scahill pins evidence to a
bulletin board above his desk
felt corny and staged. More impor

tantly, the substance of Scahill's ar
gument was not rigorously tested
and cases of civilian casualties were
not remotely contextualized. It's
hard to trust the documentary to
stay objective when it seems as if
the audience has been denied the
complete picture.
This film's shortcomings are
additionally disappointing because
its topic is so worthy. The "twisted
logic" of America's War on Terror
a "war without end" merits
attention and critique. Journalists
and filmmakers with the tenacity
to travel to "denied areas" and to
uncover untold stories have more
of a role to play than ever but
only if they can report their find
ings without serving a predeter
mined political agenda.
In some ways, "The Square"
succeeds where "Dirty Wars"
failed trying to leverage docu
mentary shooting to humanize and
complicate our understanding of a
political conflict. Other films, such
as Sarah Polley's "Stories We Tell"
and Gabriela Cowperthwaite's
"Blackfish," may have deserved
the nomination "Dirty Wars" re
ceived. The Oscar nominations
should not be read as a definitive
top-five list of this year's documen
taries. Instead, they are more valu
able as a testament to film's di
verse applications and exciting po
tentials.

ty, they are, collectively, a reminder that art matters
and that films have an uncanny capacity to shape the
world they depict.
20 Feet from Stardom
In "20 Feet from Stardom," director Melvin
Neville shines a spotlight on the anonymous voices
behind famous musicians like Ray Charles, The
Rolling Stones, Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson.
The film puts back-up singers including Tata Vega
and Merry Clayton, Lisa Fischer and Judith Hill at
center stage, and the result is stunning, as their voices

soar and their stories inspire. David Lasley, who per
formed with James Taylor, sums up the plight of back
ground vocalists: "As a backup singer, they'd like you
to come in, make things sound great, take very little
credit and go home quickly!"

Neville's film features the stories of several
women who were unwilling to just "go home." The
film is never heavy-handed about its critique of gen
der and racial politics in the entertainment industry.
Instead, Neville lets the music speak or, rather,
sing for itself.

Cutie and the Boxer
Ushio and Noriko Shinohara met in New York in
the 1970'5. He was a 41-year-old avant-garde painter,
famous for his "action art." She was a 19-year-old art
student. Today, Ushio is 80, struggling to sell his
work, while Noriko strives to find her own artistic
voice. Zachary Heinzerling's film, "Cutie and the Box
er," is a portrait of their 40-year marriage.
The couple's relationship is still a work in
progress, influenced by ongoing financial pressures
and their competing creative ambitions. As Noriko
works on a graphic novel based on her relationship


Courtesy of the American Film Institute
with Ushio, romance and family
life become the materiality of her
work. Despite Noriko's creative
pursuits, nothing about her rela
tionship with Ushio conforms to
cartoon. "Cutie and the Boxer" is a
subtle, deft film about one cou
ple's love language the fights,
silences, paintings and dances at
the heart of their life together.

The Act of Killing
Anwar Congo and Herman
Koto are self-professed "gang
sters," former Indonesian paramil
itaries who helped perpetrate the
slaughter of at least half a million
people during Indonesia's 1965-66
massacres. In "The Act of Killing,"
director Joshua Oppenheimer en
courages Congo, Koto and their
compatriots to re-enact their four
decade-old killings, using costumes,
make up and special effects to de
pict their role in the atrocities.
"The Act of Killing" is a hor
ror film. It is also a formally innova
tive and excruciatingly provocative
documentary about the relation
ship between performance, mass
violence and memory. It is hard to
watch the perverse performances:
Congo pretends to suffocate a man
with wire and Koto dresses up as a
female victim. Their pageants re
semble surrealist musicals, West
erns and film noir dramas, raising
questions about the links between
"play" violence and actual atrocity.
That said, because the film
provides very little information on
the terms of Oppenheimer's rela

tionship with the "actors," the ex
tent to which Congo and Koto
were manipulated or, in fact, "di
rected" is unclear. The film is also
weak where it fails to adequately
contextualize the barbarism of
Congo and Koto: What were the
economic and political incentives
that drove their behavior? How, ex
actly, did the Indonesian army en
gage in its campaign of extermina
tion?

More broadly, I found myself
wondering whether Oppenheimer
was right to provide these men
with a platform to re-live their
memories (or fantasies) without
providing a clear historiography of
the conflict. Ultimately, though,
these questions are the heart of
the film's value: "The Act of
Killing" forces us to think about
our own position as an internation
al "audience," observing past and
present atrocities worldwide.

The Square
Jehane Noujaim's "The
Square" traces the experiences of
a handful of Egyptian demonstra
tors amidst the unfolding chaos of
the Arab Spring, from their protest
tent idealism and kitchen table po
litical debates to their violent en
counters with the armed forces.
While these characters have di
verse histories, what they share is
perseverance: they choose time
and again to risk their lives for free
dom and democracy.
The film is a sophisticated
evaluation of the revolution's out

comes. It exposes slippage be
tween idealism and naivety, as well
as the pitfalls of a "leaderless" po
litical movement. The camera
team is unafraid to ask difficult
questions, to shoot from the eye of
the storm in the midst of the con
flagration between demonstrators
and armed forces. In this sense,
Noujaim, her colleagues and her
characters are all revolutionaries,
capturing and elaborating the
ideals that exploded in Tahrir
Square three years ago.

Dirty Wars
"Dirty Wars" follows investiga
tive journalist Jeremy Scahill to the
frontlines of the War on Terror. Di
rected by Richard Rowley, the film
begins in 2010 in Gardez,
Afghanistan, after a raid by U.S.
forces results in the death of sever
al civilians. Scahill's subsequent in
vestigation of the Joint Special Op
erations Command takes him to
Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia
where, according to Scahill,
"somehow, before our eyes, unde
clared wars have been launched
across the world."

This film was the most disap
pointing of this year's Oscar nomi
nees. The documentary depended
largely on Scahill's narration, which
seemed, at times, melodramatic
and self-congratulatory. Some of
the scenes for instance, one in
which Scahill pins evidence to a
bulletin board above his desk
felt corny and staged. More impor

tantly, the substance of Scahill's ar
gument was not rigorously tested
and cases of civilian casualties were
not remotely contextualized. It's
hard to trust the documentary to
stay objective when it seems as if
the audience has been denied the
complete picture.
This film's shortcomings are
additionally disappointing because
its topic is so worthy. The "twisted
logic" of America's War on Terror
a "war without end" merits
attention and critique. Journalists
and filmmakers with the tenacity
to travel to "denied areas" and to
uncover untold stories have more
of a role to play than ever but
only if they can report their find
ings without serving a predeter
mined political agenda.
In some ways, "The Square"
succeeds where "Dirty Wars"
failed trying to leverage docu
mentary shooting to humanize and
complicate our understanding of a
political conflict. Other films, such
as Sarah Polley's "Stories We Tell"
and Gabriela Cowperthwaite's
"Blackfish," may have deserved
the nomination "Dirty Wars" re
ceived. The Oscar nominations
should not be read as a definitive
top-five list of this year's documen
taries. Instead, they are more valu
able as a testament to film's di
verse applications and exciting po
tentials.
