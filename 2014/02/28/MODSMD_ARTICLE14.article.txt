# DOCUMENTARIES
## A
						look at this year's Oscar nominees 
### GILLIE COLLINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Though they employ diverse stories and forms to
convey their message, this year's Oscar-nomi
nated documentary features all explore the role
of art in contemporary society. Both "20 Feet
from Stardom" and "Cutie and the Boxer" ex
pose the working realities of the contemporary
art world, giving voice to relatively unheard artists.
Meanwhile, "The Act of Killing," "The Square" and
"Dirty Wars" challenge audiences to consider the
ethics and efficacy of art as a means of political ex
pression. While these films are not of universal quali
ty, they are, collectively, a reminder that art matters
and that films have an uncanny capacity to shape the
world they depict.
20 Feet from Stardom
In "20 Feet from Stardom," director Melvin
Neville shines a spotlight on the anonymous voices
behind famous musicians like Ray Charles, The
Rolling Stones, Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson.
The film puts back-up singers including Tata Vega
and Merry Clayton, Lisa Fischer and Judith Hill at
center stage, and the result is stunning, as their voices

soar and their stories inspire. David Lasley, who per
formed with James Taylor, sums up the plight of back
ground vocalists: "As a backup singer, they'd like you
to come in, make things sound great, take very little
credit and go home quickly!"

Neville's film features the stories of several
women who were unwilling to just "go home." The
film is never heavy-handed about its critique of gen
der and racial politics in the entertainment industry.
Instead, Neville lets the music speak or, rather,
sing for itself.

Cutie and the Boxer
Ushio and Noriko Shinohara met in New York in
the 1970'5. He was a 41-year-old avant-garde painter,
famous for his "action art." She was a 19-year-old art
student. Today, Ushio is 80, struggling to sell his
work, while Noriko strives to find her own artistic
voice. Zachary Heinzerling's film, "Cutie and the Box
er," is a portrait of their 40-year marriage.
The couple's relationship is still a work in
progress, influenced by ongoing financial pressures
and their competing creative ambitions. As Noriko
works on a graphic novel based on her relationship
