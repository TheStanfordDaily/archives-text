## "Napoli!" explores war & sacrifice 
### ALEXANDRA HEENEY MANAGING EDITOR 
As much fun as the first act of
"Napoli!" is, it's somewhat sur
prising that Eduardo de Filippo's
WWII tale about the moral sacri
fices necessary for survival in
times of war has been revived to
day at the American Conservatory The
atre. It's not that the "every-man-for-him
self" mentality the characters start to es
pouse is outdated, but the preachy and
patriarchal way in which the play makes
its points, by having the father be the
moral center who must correct the
wrongs of his ambitious but short-sighted
wife, is distasteful to modern audiences.
The play shares themes with
Christopher Isherwood's "Cabaret", in
which the characters are too wrapped up
in their own party to see or stop
the Nazis encroaching on them. But
where "Cabaret" made its audience com
plicit in the selfish endeavors of its char
acters, reminding us that we, too, could
easily fall into the trap of wondering
"what's politics got to do with us?",
"Napoli" lets its audience sit in conde
scending judgment of its characters, es
pecially the female ones.
Director Mark Rucker's production
has a buoyant start, where we meet the
central Jovine family: the patriarch and
former soldier Gennard (Marco Baricelli);
the plucky and enterprising matriarch,
Amalia (Seana McKenna); the eldest
child, Amadeo (Nick Gabriel), who is eas
ily seduced by his mother's upstart plans;
and the eldest daughter, Maria Rosaria
(Blair Busbee).
