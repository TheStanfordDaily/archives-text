## "Napoli!" explores war & sacrifice 
### ALEXANDRA HEENEY MANAGING EDITOR 
As much fun as the first act of
"Napoli!" is, it's somewhat sur
prising that Eduardo de Filippo's
WWII tale about the moral sacri
fices necessary for survival in
times of war has been revived to
day at the American Conservatory The
atre. It's not that the "every-man-for-him
self" mentality the characters start to es
pouse is outdated, but the preachy and
patriarchal way in which the play makes
its points, by having the father be the
moral center who must correct the
wrongs of his ambitious but short-sighted
wife, is distasteful to modern audiences.
The play shares themes with
Christopher Isherwood's "Cabaret", in
which the characters are too wrapped up
in their own party to see or stop
the Nazis encroaching on them. But
where "Cabaret" made its audience com
plicit in the selfish endeavors of its char
acters, reminding us that we, too, could
easily fall into the trap of wondering
"what's politics got to do with us?",
"Napoli" lets its audience sit in conde
scending judgment of its characters, es
pecially the female ones.
Director Mark Rucker's production
has a buoyant start, where we meet the
central Jovine family: the patriarch and
former soldier Gennard (Marco Baricelli);
the plucky and enterprising matriarch,
Amalia (Seana McKenna); the eldest
child, Amadeo (Nick Gabriel), who is eas
ily seduced by his mother's upstart plans;
and the eldest daughter, Maria Rosaria
(Blair Busbee).
They live in a small flat in the
Spanish quarter of Naples, where
they manage to scrape by and feed
themselves thanks to Amalia's dal
liances in the black market. The en
tire mattress of her bed is stuffed
with coffee, and she keeps an assort
ment of other food hidden under
neath her bed and tMoughout the
flat. There's a constant flux of cus
tomers arriving to purchase various
goods, which she has learned to
withhold at times in order to fetch a
higher price the next day. The family
must constantly watch the street be
hind their door, in case the authori
ties catch them in the middle of an il
legal trade or speaking out against
the fascist party. The set, designed by
Erik Flatmo, is a key to the play's suc
cess: It transports us effortlessly back
into 1940s Naples and shows us the
homey, if simple, abode where the
Jovines live.
The first act is full of good fun,
which culminates with a police offi
cer arriving to inspect the place after
getting tipped-off about Amalia's
business. Gennard is hilariously
forced to play dead so the family can
pretend to be in mourmng and de
flect the police officer's question.
Shenanigans ensue: The officer de
cides to play along and thus refuses

to leave until Gennard's body gets
picked up by an undertaker, all the
while trying to get him to admit he's
not actually dead.
Things start to go downhill after
the intermission. When the curtain
opens on Act Two, we see that
Amalia has upgraded the furnishings
of her flat to garish displays of her
newfound wealth. What started as a
business for survival has thrived
enough to make her rich and insensi
tive to those who are now struggling.
When a formerly rich neighbor (An
thony Fusco) is no longer able to pay
his bills, she refuses to have mercy on
him, buying out his property for a
meager price and forcing Ms family in
to the streets. Of course, an extremely
on-the-nose morality tale is to follow:
She'll eventually need Ms help and
learn to regret her obstinacy.
While the Jovine family has been
prospering, Gennard has been off
having war adventures, wMch took
him to a German work camp that he
barely escaped. At the beginning of
the second act, he's presumed dead
but returns, eager to be reumted with
Ms family and tell Ms stories of hard
sMps in the war. His family, however,
are uninterested in Ms experiences:
they can't bare to deal with the harsh
realities of the war, having become
too caught up in their own financial
successes that the war made possible.
And as is this play's modus operan
dus, it will fall to the patriarch to cor
rect his wife's wrongs.

"Napoli!" stars some of North
America's theater royalty, all giving
wonderful performances in a play
that isn't really worthy of them.
Seana McKenna is a star of the Cana
dian Stratford Festival and has
wowed audiences in roles like the ti
tle character in Shakespeare's
"Richard III." Her physicality and
comic timing here are impeccable,
but there's just not enough on the
page to make Amalia seem like a real

and complicated person, although
McKenna always keeps her com
pelling.
Former Shakespeare Santa Cruz
artistic director Marco Bariccelli,
meanwhile, plays Gennard as world
wearied and kind-hearted: he makes
him sympathetic and well-meaning
even as he's forced to be somewhat
chauvinistic. Even as the neighbor,
Anthony Fusco has the thankless job
of being the walking plot device to

make Amalia realize her wrongs, and
yet he makes the man caring, down
trodden and forgiving rather than a
simple martyr. It's easy to fall in love
with the play in the first act it's
just so much fun and just as easy
to fall just as quickly out of love with
it in the second when it teaches its
lesson.

thony Fusco) is no longer able to pay
his bills, she refuses to have mercy on
him, buying out his property for a
meager price and forcing Ms family in
to the streets. Of course, an extremely
on-the-nose morality tale is to follow:
She'll eventually need Ms help and
learn to regret her obstinacy.
While the Jovine family has been
prospering, Gennard has been off
having war adventures, wMch took
him to a German work camp that he
barely escaped. At the beginning of
the second act, he's presumed dead
but returns, eager to be reumted with
Ms family and tell Ms stories of hard
sMps in the war. His family, however,
are uninterested in Ms experiences:
they can't bare to deal with the harsh
realities of the war, having become
too caught up in their own financial
successes that the war made possible.
And as is this play's modus operan
dus, it will fall to the patriarch to cor
rect his wife's wrongs.

"Napoli!" stars some of North
America's theater royalty, all giving
wonderful performances in a play
that isn't really worthy of them.
Seana McKenna is a star of the Cana
dian Stratford Festival and has
wowed audiences in roles like the ti
tle character in Shakespeare's
"Richard III." Her physicality and
comic timing here are impeccable,
but there's just not enough on the
page to make Amalia seem like a real

and complicated person, although
McKenna always keeps her com
pelling.
Former Shakespeare Santa Cruz
artistic director Marco Bariccelli,
meanwhile, plays Gennard as world
wearied and kind-hearted: he makes
him sympathetic and well-meaning
even as he's forced to be somewhat
chauvinistic. Even as the neighbor,
Anthony Fusco has the thankless job
of being the walking plot device to

make Amalia realize her wrongs, and
yet he makes the man caring, down
trodden and forgiving rather than a
simple martyr. It's easy to fall in love
with the play in the first act it's
just so much fun and just as easy
to fall just as quickly out of love with
it in the second when it teaches its
lesson.

As much fun as the first act of
"Napoli!" is, it's somewhat sur
prising that Eduardo de Filippo's
WWII tale about the moral sacri
fices necessary for survival in
times of war has been revived to
day at the American Conservatory The
atre. It's not that the "every-man-for-him
self" mentality the characters start to es
pouse is outdated, but the preachy and
patriarchal way in which the play makes
its points, by having the father be the
moral center who must correct the
wrongs of his ambitious but short-sighted
wife, is distasteful to modern audiences.
The play shares themes with
Christopher Isherwood's "Cabaret", in
which the characters are too wrapped up
in their own party to see or stop
the Nazis encroaching on them. But
where "Cabaret" made its audience com
plicit in the selfish endeavors of its char
acters, reminding us that we, too, could
easily fall into the trap of wondering
"what's politics got to do with us?",
"Napoli" lets its audience sit in conde
scending judgment of its characters, es
pecially the female ones.
Director Mark Rucker's production
has a buoyant start, where we meet the
central Jovine family: the patriarch and
former soldier Gennard (Marco Baricelli);
the plucky and enterprising matriarch,
Amalia (Seana McKenna); the eldest
child, Amadeo (Nick Gabriel), who is eas
ily seduced by his mother's upstart plans;
and the eldest daughter, Maria Rosaria
(Blair Busbee).
They live in a small flat in the
Spanish quarter of Naples, where
they manage to scrape by and feed
themselves thanks to Amalia's dal
liances in the black market. The en
tire mattress of her bed is stuffed
with coffee, and she keeps an assort
ment of other food hidden under
neath her bed and tMoughout the
flat. There's a constant flux of cus
tomers arriving to purchase various
goods, which she has learned to
withhold at times in order to fetch a
higher price the next day. The family
must constantly watch the street be
hind their door, in case the authori
ties catch them in the middle of an il
legal trade or speaking out against
the fascist party. The set, designed by
Erik Flatmo, is a key to the play's suc
cess: It transports us effortlessly back
into 1940s Naples and shows us the
homey, if simple, abode where the
Jovines live.
The first act is full of good fun,
which culminates with a police offi
cer arriving to inspect the place after
getting tipped-off about Amalia's
business. Gennard is hilariously
forced to play dead so the family can
pretend to be in mourmng and de
flect the police officer's question.
Shenanigans ensue: The officer de
cides to play along and thus refuses

to leave until Gennard's body gets
picked up by an undertaker, all the
while trying to get him to admit he's
not actually dead.
Things start to go downhill after
the intermission. When the curtain
opens on Act Two, we see that
Amalia has upgraded the furnishings
of her flat to garish displays of her
newfound wealth. What started as a
business for survival has thrived
enough to make her rich and insensi
tive to those who are now struggling.
