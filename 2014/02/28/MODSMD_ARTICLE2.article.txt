## LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT TO PLAY OR NOT TO PLAY, THAT'S THE QUESTION 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
Some hate it and some
love it. For others, it's a combi
nation of the two. Athletics is
supposed to be a positive influ
ence in any person's life

whether that person is a Divi
sion I athlete aspiring for a
professional career or an elder
ly golfer who has been playing
recreationally his whole life.
Sports lead to the release of
endorphins that make people
happier and healthier.
What happens, however,
when playing a sport at the
collegiate level becomes more
like a job? What happens when
it produces more pain than
pleasure and brings more
doubts than certainties?
"I think with all of the
hard times, it's only worth it if
you love it," said junior
women's soccer player Haley
Rosen. "I would be lying if I
hadn't thought of quitting, but
at the end of the day if you
love your sport then there's no
reason that you should stop.
But you have to find away for
it to be a manageable lifestyle,
where you can handle the ups
and downs and all the hours."

Sophomore Maggie Teets
competed for women's gym
nastics last year. However, af
ter a year of those ups and
downs, she made the decision
to stop competing.

"You have time for two
things out of the three a so
cial life, sports and academics

and so you end up not hav
ing a whole lot of time for oth
er things," Teets said. "You get
to learn how to manage your
time very well, and I wanted
to pursue something else.
That's why I decided not to
come back."

Since the age of 3, Teets
has trained for 49 out of the
52 weeks every year. She suf
fered broken bones and torn
ligaments and admitted that
injuries are a part of the sport
that can't be avoided. She ex
plained that the atmosphere of
training at Stanford was a lot
different than at her home
gym; that difference, coupled
with the difficulty of being
away from home, the rigid ex
pectations to succeed and the
need to push away any emo
tions not beneficial to the
team as a whole, was too
much to handle at times. Diet
was strictly regimented and a
no-sugar rule was implement
ed for the team, emphasizing
the necessity for gymnasts to
keep up appearances and not
just performances.

"I didn't do very well
[dealing with the pressure],"
Teets said. "I wasn't very hap
py last year. I did not handle
the pressure as well as I could
have ... I think it was an ad
justing process and toward the
end of the year, I learned how
to manage all that. But coming
in and starting, I think I cried
every day for months. It was a
lot to take in."

"Being on a team really

has the capacity to warp your
goals and totally push you in a
direction you didn't anticipate
going in," explained another
athlete who made the decision
to leave his/her sport. "That's
just the culture. All of the facil
ities, all of the advantages that

athletes get, the more they

give you the more they own
you."

There's pressure to keep
competing on several fronts:
to pay for college and keep
one's scholarship, to maintain
the status and prestige that be-

After a year of tears and the pressure to be perfect, Maggie
Teets (above) decided to pursue a different path on the Farm.
