## LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT TO PLAY OR NOT TO PLAY, THAT'S THE QUESTION 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
Some hate it and some
love it. For others, it's a combi
nation of the two. Athletics is
supposed to be a positive influ
ence in any person's life

whether that person is a Divi
sion I athlete aspiring for a
professional career or an elder
ly golfer who has been playing
recreationally his whole life.
Sports lead to the release of
endorphins that make people
happier and healthier.
What happens, however,
when playing a sport at the
collegiate level becomes more
like a job? What happens when
it produces more pain than
pleasure and brings more
doubts than certainties?
"I think with all of the
hard times, it's only worth it if
you love it," said junior
women's soccer player Haley
Rosen. "I would be lying if I
hadn't thought of quitting, but
at the end of the day if you
love your sport then there's no
reason that you should stop.
But you have to find away for
it to be a manageable lifestyle,
where you can handle the ups
and downs and all the hours."

Sophomore Maggie Teets
competed for women's gym
nastics last year. However, af
ter a year of those ups and
downs, she made the decision
to stop competing.

"You have time for two
things out of the three a so
cial life, sports and academics

and so you end up not hav
ing a whole lot of time for oth
er things," Teets said. "You get
to learn how to manage your
time very well, and I wanted
to pursue something else.
That's why I decided not to
come back."

Since the age of 3, Teets
has trained for 49 out of the
52 weeks every year. She suf
fered broken bones and torn
ligaments and admitted that
injuries are a part of the sport
that can't be avoided. She ex
plained that the atmosphere of
training at Stanford was a lot
different than at her home
gym; that difference, coupled
with the difficulty of being
away from home, the rigid ex
pectations to succeed and the
need to push away any emo
tions not beneficial to the
team as a whole, was too
much to handle at times. Diet
was strictly regimented and a
no-sugar rule was implement
ed for the team, emphasizing
the necessity for gymnasts to
keep up appearances and not
just performances.

"I didn't do very well
[dealing with the pressure],"
Teets said. "I wasn't very hap
py last year. I did not handle
the pressure as well as I could
have ... I think it was an ad
justing process and toward the
end of the year, I learned how
to manage all that. But coming
in and starting, I think I cried
every day for months. It was a
lot to take in."

"Being on a team really

has the capacity to warp your
goals and totally push you in a
direction you didn't anticipate
going in," explained another
athlete who made the decision
to leave his/her sport. "That's
just the culture. All of the facil
ities, all of the advantages that

athletes get, the more they

give you the more they own
you."

There's pressure to keep
competing on several fronts:
to pay for college and keep
one's scholarship, to maintain
the status and prestige that be-

ing a student-athlete brings, to not
let down family, teammates or
coaches and to not break a commit
ment.

"If you get yourself to a point
where you don't really want to be
doing it anymore, it's too late,"
said senior golfer Cameron Wil
son. "You've already made a prom
ise to your teammates, your coach
es and all the people who are help
ing."

The outside voices and factors
can be overwhelming, and they
make it hard to decide whether to
keep competing or to take a differ
ent path that could potentially be
more rewarding.
"The thing about being on an
athletic scholarship is that it's an
honor, but it also carries this bur
den where you can never back out
of it," said another athlete. "Some
times you feel trapped and it puts

you in this dilemma, because to
get your education paid for is so
huge."

Not all athletes leave their
sport just because of those pres
sures. Many decide that their time
at Stanford would be better spent
pursuing other avenues and op
portunities, and if they've lost
their love for their sport, that it is
n't worth the huge chunk of time
and energy anymore.
"Playing a Division I sport re
quires so much effort and so much
mental strength," said sophomore
women's soccer player Sarah Cox.
"It's a really difficult thing if you
don't love the sport and you're not
playing for the love of the game or
if you don't love your teammates."
Furthermore, it's hard to keep
going for athletes when their bod
ies are being beaten up by the im
pact of sports like gymnastics,
track or football, which can have
long-term repercussions on ath
letes' health.
"I think it's instinctive in ath
letes to just keep pushing them

selves to see how far they can
get," said Stanford track athlete
Steven Solomon, who was also
part of the Australian 2012
Olympic team. "I'm way too in
love with what track and field
gives me to even consider stop
ping, even at the lowest points in
track and field, like my [ruptured
disk] injury last year... [But] of
course there [were] natural
thoughts of 'what are you doing?'"
Things can get particularly dif
ficult for student-athletes when so
much effort is being put in but the
results aren't showing.
"If you get too bogged down
with the tough parts of the sport

which are a lot there can
definitely be other things on cam
pus that are more appealing," said
senior rower Austin Hack. "Day to
day, you might not see that much
progress; you're grinding so hard
and pushing for it, and it takes a
long time for all of your efforts to
come through."
Ultimately, the athletes
agreed that the decision to keep

playing is one decision that only
the athlete and nobody else
can make in order to be happy in
the long run.
"We don't want to force any
one to do anything that they don't
want to do," said men's rowing
head coach Craig Amerkhanian.
"We need people that really want
to be here and for each other, like
every team does. I wish everyone
stayed on the team and nobody
ever left, but that's not realistic."
Sophomore guard Kiran
Lakhian left the women's basket
ball team after her freshman year,
realizing that the amount of time
that it required was not worth it
when her grades started to drop
and playing time was scarce. For
Lakhian, basketball could no
longer be the priority in her life if
her ultimate goal was going to
medical school, so she chose to
leave her sport and make her med
ical aspirations a more significant
priority in her life. She currently
interns with the sports medicine
program and Human Performance

Lab while working for a nonprofit
as a nutritional director.

"I'm just able to explore all
the different organizations and op
portunities whereas before [it
was] basketball and school, that's
it," Lakhian said. "At the same
time, I do miss it because I did put
18 years of my life into it, so I feel
like I gave up, which is kind of
hard."

The benefit of no longer be
ing an athlete at Stanford, one cur
rent athlete commented, is that
they are able to better plan ahead
for the future and not be so con
sumed with just getting through
the week, which is the only thing
that being an athlete allows for.
"There were so many things I
wanted to do but couldn't because
of the time commitment that ath
letics had," Teets said. "I really
wanted that happiness and to get
involved and I have, and I don't re
gret quitting at all."

"I'm just able to explore all

at the end of the day if you

But you have to find away for

where you can handle the ups

Sophomore Maggie Teets
competed for women's gym
nastics last year. However, af
ter a year of those ups and
downs, she made the decision
to stop competing.

"You have time for two
things out of the three a so
cial life, sports and academics

and so you end up not hav
ing a whole lot of time for oth
er things," Teets said. "You get
to learn how to manage your
time very well, and I wanted
to pursue something else.
That's why I decided not to
come back."

Since the age of 3, Teets
has trained for 49 out of the
52 weeks every year. She suf
fered broken bones and torn
ligaments and admitted that
injuries are a part of the sport
that can't be avoided. She ex

"I didn't do very well

have ... I think it was an ad

"If you get yourself to a point
where you don't really want to be

said senior golfer Cameron Wil

The outside voices and factors
can be overwhelming, and they
make it hard to decide whether to
keep competing or to take a differ

"The thing about being on an
athletic scholarship is that it's an
honor, but it also carries this bur
den where you can never back out
of it," said another athlete. "Some
times you feel trapped and it puts

you in this dilemma, because to
get your education paid for is so
huge."

Not all athletes leave their
sport just because of those pres
sures. Many decide that their time
at Stanford would be better spent
pursuing other avenues and op
portunities, and if they've lost
their love for their sport, that it is
n't worth the huge chunk of time
and energy anymore.
"Playing a Division I sport re
quires so much effort and so much
mental strength," said sophomore
women's soccer player Sarah Cox.
"It's a really difficult thing if you
don't love the sport and you're not
playing for the love of the game or
if you don't love your teammates."
Furthermore, it's hard to keep
going for athletes when their bod
ies are being beaten up by the im
pact of sports like gymnastics,
track or football, which can have
long-term repercussions on ath
letes' health.
"I think it's instinctive in ath
letes to just keep pushing them

selves to see how far they can
get," said Stanford track athlete
Steven Solomon, who was also
part of the Australian 2012
Olympic team. "I'm way too in
love with what track and field
gives me to even consider stop
ping, even at the lowest points in
track and field, like my [ruptured
disk] injury last year... [But] of
course there [were] natural
thoughts of 'what are you doing?'"
Things can get particularly dif
ficult for student-athletes when so
much effort is being put in but the
results aren't showing.
"If you get too bogged down
with the tough parts of the sport

which are a lot there can
definitely be other things on cam

athletic scholarship is that it's an
honor, but it also carries this bur
den where you can never back out
of it," said another athlete. "Some
times you feel trapped and it puts

you in this dilemma, because to
get your education paid for is so
huge."

Not all athletes leave their
sport just because of those pres
sures. Many decide that their time
at Stanford would be better spent
pursuing other avenues and op
portunities, and if they've lost
their love for their sport, that it is
n't worth the huge chunk of time
and energy anymore.
"Playing a Division I sport re
quires so much effort and so much
mental strength," said sophomore
women's soccer player Sarah Cox.
"It's a really difficult thing if you
don't love the sport and you're not
playing for the love of the game or
if you don't love your teammates."
Furthermore, it's hard to keep
going for athletes when their bod
ies are being beaten up by the im
pact of sports like gymnastics,
track or football, which can have
long-term repercussions on ath
letes' health.
"I think it's instinctive in ath
letes to just keep pushing them

selves to see how far they can
get," said Stanford track athlete
Steven Solomon, who was also
part of the Australian 2012
Olympic team. "I'm way too in
love with what track and field
gives me to even consider stop
ping, even at the lowest points in
track and field, like my [ruptured
disk] injury last year... [But] of
course there [were] natural
thoughts of 'what are you doing?'"
Things can get particularly dif
ficult for student-athletes when so
much effort is being put in but the
results aren't showing.
"If you get too bogged down
with the tough parts of the sport

which are a lot there can
definitely be other things on cam
pus that are more appealing," said
senior rower Austin Hack. "Day to
day, you might not see that much
progress; you're grinding so hard
and pushing for it, and it takes a
long time for all of your efforts to
come through."
Ultimately, the athletes
agreed that the decision to keep

playing is one decision that only
the athlete and nobody else
can make in order to be happy in
the long run.
"We don't want to force any
one to do anything that they don't
want to do," said men's rowing
head coach Craig Amerkhanian.
"We need people that really want
to be here and for each other, like
every team does. I wish everyone
stayed on the team and nobody
ever left, but that's not realistic."
Sophomore guard Kiran
Lakhian left the women's basket
ball team after her freshman year,
realizing that the amount of time
that it required was not worth it
when her grades started to drop
and playing time was scarce. For
Lakhian, basketball could no
longer be the priority in her life if
her ultimate goal was going to
medical school, so she chose to
leave her sport and make her med
ical aspirations a more significant
priority in her life. She currently
interns with the sports medicine
program and Human Performance

Lab while working for a nonprofit
as a nutritional director.

"I'm just able to explore all
the different organizations and op
portunities whereas before [it
was] basketball and school, that's
it," Lakhian said. "At the same
time, I do miss it because I did put
18 years of my life into it, so I feel
like I gave up, which is kind of
hard."

The benefit of no longer be
ing an athlete at Stanford, one cur
rent athlete commented, is that
they are able to better plan ahead
for the future and not be so con
sumed with just getting through
the week, which is the only thing
that being an athlete allows for.
"There were so many things I
wanted to do but couldn't because
of the time commitment that ath
letics had," Teets said. "I really
wanted that happiness and to get
involved and I have, and I don't re
gret quitting at all."
