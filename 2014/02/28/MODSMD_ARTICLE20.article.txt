can South, various revival periods of the 20th cen
tury on the West Coast, the Gospel Golden Age,
apartheid in South Africa and current narratives
of justice influenced by that musical power.
While that breadth constitutes a lot of
ground to cover in one performance, embody
ing versatility is a core tenet of gospel music.
It has delivered praise, accompanied work,
honored burial, comforted grief, planned es
cape, spread knowledge and still finds mean
ing within the heart of a2l st century listener.
This is one of our country's first art forms
these songs have initiated and elevated so
cial movements from every era and location.
Yet a real understanding of the gravity of
gospel music's history is missing from the im
mediate recognition you feel when you hear
"This Little Light of Mine."

Jessica Anderson 'l4 has sought to ad
dress this void. Having sung for over a decade,
from theatre to jazz, her musical style arises
from a "large medley of sounds." At Stanford,
Anderson has directed the Gospel Choir and
starred in "The Color Purple." Creation, to An
derson, has been a continuous part of life,
choreographing entire shows to Stevie Wonder
albums as a little girl.
This Saturday's performance will demon
strate that Anderson has found not only a
place to pursue art but also to create it, featur
ing her own talent as a performer but also to
kens from various experiences from con
necting with former members of the Commit
tee for Black Performing Arts to academic re
search spanning her time at Stanford.
"A major lesson I learned was there is a

way to pay homage to people," Anderson ex
plained. "One way is to play up individual
strength, reminding them of their own
worth."
Make it out to Dinkelspiel Auditorium on
Saturday at 7 p.m. Get there early, as it's first
come, first-show. Allow the experience to find
you, question you, move you. Because this is
what Stanford is about loving, seeking ex
periences to pursue that love, synthesizing
findings around it, and producing a collabora
tive whole to honor it. So whether you are cur
rently writing a term paper or founding a start
up, come take part in Anderson's legacy of the
power in intentional connection.
