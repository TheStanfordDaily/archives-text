## Sherian Front gives chills 
### RYAN HOAGLUND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In Siberia, it gets cold. Real cold. I bore this in
mind as I made sure to slip on my trusty pair of
corduroys before heading over to Siberian Front's
first live performance at Sigma Chi Saturday
night. By the end of the show I wished I had
worn shorts, and not just because of all the
spilled beer.
The indie group, composed of five Stanford un
dergraduates, seamlessly transplanted the energy
they had harvested in their practice sessions, in
stantly heating up the room. From the opening
chords, it was obvious that this band was meant to
perform.

Not only did they feature a flashy freshman
front man and a gifted guitarist, but Siberian Front
also came with strong supporting players on bass,
drums and rhythm guitar. Each instrument featured
a very different personality, creating an enticing
chemistry within the band itself as well as for the au
dience. Their sound reflected this harmonious blend
of characters. Lovably ostentatious, the band clearly
felt free to rid themselves of all inhibitions as well as
pretenses. They were their own unit, blending per

sonal experience with common musical interest all in
the name of a good time.
"I feel like, for us, the primary thing that's been
driving a lot of this is having fun, having a good time,"
said drummer Shamik Mascharak 'l5. "We're not try
ing to change society with our music, but what I really
hope we can do is transmit that same positivity and
happiness that we get from our music to people."
Anyone in attendance would have to agree that
they accomplished that goal. By the end of the first
song, an original called "Seattle", all underlying ten
sion in the room had melted away amidst the driving
riffs and passionate vocals.
After playing two more originals, the group per
formed a cover of "Champagne Supernova" by Oasis,
with the crowd offering backup vocals during the
chorus. Between this and their next original song,
"Bottles and Cans" (strikingly appropriate for the giv
en venue), the show reached its climax. Chants of
"Gio's house, Gio's house, Gio's house," filled the
room, culminating in a melodramatic ripping off of
lead guitarist Gio Jacuzzi 'l6's shirt.

of the night, "Freedom" —or at
least what was supposed to be the
last song of the night. Following calls
for an encore, the whole room
bounced back and forth from one
foot to the other, keeping in rhythm
with the heavy bass of the Strokes.
"We're in it for people to listen
to it and have fun with it," com
mented bassist Damian McGlothlin
'l5.
As I slipped out the door I could
see they had succeeded. It was
smiles all around, and the tone had
been set for a good night ahead.
