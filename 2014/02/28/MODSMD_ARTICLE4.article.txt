# DEFEATED BUT NOT DESTROYED

### NIUNIU TEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Although all Stanford students have their
ups and downs in life during their college ex
periences, student-athletes live out their wins
and losses at an entirely different level of pub
licity. When they take a fall, be it physical or
psychological, there's a lot of pressure from
not just their teammates and coaches, but also
their fans, to dust themselves off and get back
up.
Injuries
Injured athletes are faced with a difficult
problem as much as they might want to get
back into their sport as quickly as possible,
their bodies won't let them compete, or even
practice.
Junior soccer player Haley Rosen knows
what it means to be an injured student-athlete
all too well: She has been injured during each
of her seasons at Stanford. The first time she
was injured was freshman year, forcing her to
redshirt her first season on the Farm.
"My world turned upside down," she said.
"My priorities completely shifted, I was not a
happy person and I almost transferred."

Her experiences following the incident
weren't any better. It was difficult to stay mo
tivated to train while not being able to con
tribute on the field in games or keep her game
sharp through practices.
"Every year, with every injury, presents
new challenges," she said. "You realize that
you're kind of alone and that you are a com
modity."

Like Rosen, senior runner Tate Murray
sustained injuries during each of her first
three seasons as a Stanford athlete, beginning
with a stress fracture in her femur her fresh
man year that forced her to miss the indoor
and outdoor track seasons. Sophomore year
brought more stress fractures that kept her
out for the majority of cross country and track.
Finally, during spring of her junior year, Mur
ray battled back from a hernia and another
stress fracture from the cross country season
to race in the Pac-12 Championships. This is
her one-year anniversary of returning from in
jury.

Both Rosen and Murray agreed that the
lasting effects from the injuries were mostly
psychological in spite of the initial physical
causes.

"There comes a point when you're getting
close to running again, but you're not quite
there or you're still only cross-training," Mur
ray said. "You just feel very over it and very ap
athetic and uncaring... It's so hard to watch
your teammates get to run and do so well and
you're happy for them. But it's just heartbreak
ing that your body won't let you [compete]."
Like many of her fellow athletes, Murray
has found that the journey back from injury
was ultimately more important than the final
goal of returning to the field.
"[The] lesson is that it's all about the
process. It can't be about the end result be
cause you don't always have control of it," she
said. "But that doesn't mean that all of the try
ing to get there wasn't worth it."

Losses
While on a winning streak, players gain
confidence by building momentum and enjoy
ing success. On the other hand, the pressure
to continue performing at a high caliber only
increases.
"For me, I don't think about streaks," said
senior soccer player Kendall Romine. "But
when you hear it from the media and from
coaches and from random people who read
about it, then you internalize it and it sucks."
As a result, a break in the streak can come
as a relief to the athletes. Such was the case
for some members of the women's soccer

The journey
is infinitely
more important
than the
end result

Arrillaga Family Sports Center receiving treatment.
Even in good health, athletes make multiple visits
to the training and weight rooms and ice baths.

team, which suffered its first
home loss since 2007 last season.

"Honestly, I think it felt great
for me," Rosen said. "It was like
bam , pressure and record all
gone, it was like a clean slate to
move forward."

However, student-athletes
will often have to recover from
the resulting blow to their confi
dence in the immediate after
math of suffering such a loss.

"Confidence is so important
in itself, and it's a cycle," Murray
said. "If you are confident, then
you'll run better, and then you'll
get more confident and run even
better. And if you're lacking in
confidence it's really hard to run
well because it's hard to believe
in yourself and then you won't do
it."

"You just have to believe in
your ability when no one else
does," she continued. "You have
to believe that you are good."
