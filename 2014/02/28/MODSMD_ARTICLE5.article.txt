While high school student-athletes certainly
dedicate a lot of time and energy to refining their
craft, the collegiate lifestyle brings a new level of
challenge that many incoming freshmen can find
daunting and overwhelming at first. In addition to
being under much more pressure to perform on a
bigger, more exposed stage in front of a national
audience, they must also deal with the challenges
that regular college freshmen face: making
friends, settling into a community and creating a
niche in an unfamiliar setting.

It's a tough, multifaceted adjustment, but

feel that the intense workload of college athletics
is one of the most difficult aspects to adapt to.

times a week," said freshman men's volleyball
player Clay Jones. "But here, it's five days a week

athletes at Stanford is far beyond that of high

the collegiate level. As a result, it is difficult for
collegiate coaches to ease the transition for
younger athletes, as they must facilitate the ad
justment to a more rigorous load as quickly as pos
sible in order to foster collegiate contenders.
"Our coaches are definitely all business," said
sophomore Kiran Lakhian, a former women's bas
ketball player. "It's just their job to stick to basket
ball."

The coaches tell a similar story of pressure
and expectations.

"I think there is a lot of internal pressure,"
said men's crew assistant coach Jake Cornelius.
"As coaches, we reframe what's important."
Perhaps even more difficult than the massive
workload of a student-athlete is the mental transi
tion for many high school stars becoming college
benchwarmers. To be recruited by Stanford, ath-
