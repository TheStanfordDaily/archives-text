# Moving to a bigger stage
## 
### CARLIE TENENBAUM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While high school student-athletes certainly
dedicate a lot of time and energy to refining their
craft, the collegiate lifestyle brings a new level of
challenge that many incoming freshmen can find
daunting and overwhelming at first. In addition to
being under much more pressure to perform on a
bigger, more exposed stage in front of a national
audience, they must also deal with the challenges
that regular college freshmen face: making
friends, settling into a community and creating a
niche in an unfamiliar setting.

It's a tough, multifaceted adjustment, but
among the many different elements many players
feel that the intense workload of college athletics
is one of the most difficult aspects to adapt to.
"In high school, I would practice two to three
times a week," said freshman men's volleyball
player Clay Jones. "But here, it's five days a week
... Just trying to get through the day is pretty dif
ficult just because our practices are so long."
The level of conditioning and intensity for
athletes at Stanford is far beyond that of high
school due to the increased speed and talent at
the collegiate level. As a result, it is difficult for
collegiate coaches to ease the transition for
younger athletes, as they must facilitate the ad
justment to a more rigorous load as quickly as pos
sible in order to foster collegiate contenders.
"Our coaches are definitely all business," said
sophomore Kiran Lakhian, a former women's bas
ketball player. "It's just their job to stick to basket
ball."

The coaches tell a similar story of pressure
and expectations.

"I think there is a lot of internal pressure,"
said men's crew assistant coach Jake Cornelius.
"As coaches, we reframe what's important."
Perhaps even more difficult than the massive
workload of a student-athlete is the mental transi
tion for many high school stars becoming college
benchwarmers. To be recruited by Stanford, ath-

letes have to prove themselves head-and
shoulder above their high school and club
competition. However, now amongst the top
competitors in their respective sport, many
incoming freshmen find the adjustment
from superstar to second-string player a
tough reality.
"[Before] we come here, we're the best
at our sport and the best in the classroom,"
said junior women's soccer player Haley
Rosen, "and then we come to Stanford and
we're average at best, on a good day."
Jones, for one, wasn't quite ready to re
linquish his stardom upon stepping on the
Cardinal men's volleyball court.

"I was expecting that I would come in
right off the bat and play my best volleyball
every day at practice and that I would be in
peak condition," Jones said. "That was one
thing that I wasn't prepared for: the level of
play of college volleyball."
With the four or five-year cycle of colle
giate athletics constantly in motion, howev
er, many of those student-athletes see their
behind-the-scenes hard work pay off when
they are eventually called upon to fill vacant
spots left by departing seniors. And when
they get that chance, it becomes a validation
of their hard-fought but successful
transition from a fresh-faced high school
graduate to a full-time collegiate athlete.
