## SPORTS AS A MENTAL GAME 
### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
With three seconds remaining in regulation and the
score tied at 38, then-sophomore kicker Jordan Williamson
walked out onto the turf at the University of Phoenix Sta
dium. After a career game for Andrew Luck, a Fiesta Bowl
victory and Stanford's 12th win of the 2012 season
was on the line, to be determined by the flight of a football
that was set 35 yards away from the goal posts and almost
perfectly centered between the hashes.

Minutes later, Williamson was given another opportu
nity this time, to put the Cardinal ahead in overtime. It
was a 43-yarder from the right hash.

A football kicker's psyche is often the first example
that comes to mind when fans
consider sports psychology. The field goal seems so rou
tine, with the kicker going through the same motions on
every attempt. Yet any single missed opportunity can send
the athlete's mental state into chaos, starting from the di
rect aftermath of the miss and leading to a complete loss
of confidence and physical ability to kick a field goal.
Williamson's missed kicks in the 2012 Fiesta Bowl
could have led to a career-ending reaction.
"[They could have caused] a traumatic psychopathol
ogy, like post-traumatic stress
disorder," said Hans Steiner, professor emeritus of psychi
atry, "meaning that [the athlete is] experiencing flashes of
the moment."

But 10 months later, Williamson had another massive
opportunity: a 37-yard field goal in overtime at Oregon to
hand the Ducks their first loss and propel the Cardinal to a
potential Rose Bowl berth. This time, the kick was true.
"As soon as I got done being at the bottom of that pile
and I hopped up, I thought to myself, 'Wow. It's been a full
circle. It's practically been a year and the complete opposite
situation'," Williamson said. 'As much as I hated missing
those kicks in the Fiesta Bowl, and as much as I wish the
team had gotten a win and that we would've won the Fiesta
Bowl, I can say, for my personal growth, it was needed."
Dealing with failure is key to performing well as a stu
dent-athlete, especially considering the poise that's often
associated with the role and the high expectations at Stan
ford. The historic success of the women's basketball pro
gram, which has amassed a 768-154 (.833) record in its 28
seasons under head coach Tara VanDerveer, has raised the
team's expectations to extraordinary levels.
