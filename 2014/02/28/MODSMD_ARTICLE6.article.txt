## SPORTS AS A MENTAL GAME 
### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
With three seconds remaining in regulation and the
score tied at 38, then-sophomore kicker Jordan Williamson
walked out onto the turf at the University of Phoenix Sta
dium. After a career game for Andrew Luck, a Fiesta Bowl
victory and Stanford's 12th win of the 2012 season
was on the line, to be determined by the flight of a football
that was set 35 yards away from the goal posts and almost
perfectly centered between the hashes.

Minutes later, Williamson was given another opportu
nity this time, to put the Cardinal ahead in overtime. It
was a 43-yarder from the right hash.

A football kicker's psyche is often the first example
that comes to mind when fans
consider sports psychology. The field goal seems so rou
tine, with the kicker going through the same motions on
every attempt. Yet any single missed opportunity can send
the athlete's mental state into chaos, starting from the di
rect aftermath of the miss and leading to a complete loss
of confidence and physical ability to kick a field goal.
Williamson's missed kicks in the 2012 Fiesta Bowl
could have led to a career-ending reaction.
"[They could have caused] a traumatic psychopathol
ogy, like post-traumatic stress
disorder," said Hans Steiner, professor emeritus of psychi
atry, "meaning that [the athlete is] experiencing flashes of
the moment."

But 10 months later, Williamson had another massive
opportunity: a 37-yard field goal in overtime at Oregon to
hand the Ducks their first loss and propel the Cardinal to a
potential Rose Bowl berth. This time, the kick was true.
"As soon as I got done being at the bottom of that pile
and I hopped up, I thought to myself, 'Wow. It's been a full
circle. It's practically been a year and the complete opposite
situation'," Williamson said. 'As much as I hated missing
those kicks in the Fiesta Bowl, and as much as I wish the
team had gotten a win and that we would've won the Fiesta
Bowl, I can say, for my personal growth, it was needed."
Dealing with failure is key to performing well as a stu
dent-athlete, especially considering the poise that's often
associated with the role and the high expectations at Stan
ford. The historic success of the women's basketball pro
gram, which has amassed a 768-154 (.833) record in its 28
seasons under head coach Tara VanDerveer, has raised the
team's expectations to extraordinary levels.
"In a sense, almost every game
we go into we're expected to win.
So I think that's the hardest part,
where the pressure is not to lose,"
said senior Toni Kokenis, who has
medically retired and is not playing
this season. "It's almost like you can
get into the mindset of instead of
playing to win—you're playing not
to lose, which is an interesting ten
sion."

According to Ahmed Raza Khan,
a first-year child psychology fellow in
the School of Medicine, the high
expectations in situations like these
a win being expected in almost
every game often prevent play
ers from feeling rewarded for their
good, consistent performances;
they only feel castigated after a de
feat.

"That can affect not just your
outlook, but your mental state and

happiness," Khan said.
An issue just as pressing for
student-athletes at Stanford is be
ing able to juggle academic and ath
letic responsibilities with the con
stant tug-of-war between the stu
dent-athlete, parents and coach

what Steiner refers to as the "un
holy triad."
"None of these three people
want to have a look at this being too
hard, too demanding, too problemat
ic," Steiner said.
"I remember telling my parents
freshman year that I was being
pulled in a million
different directions," said Haley
Rosen, a junior on the women's soc
cer team. "What's crazy, too, is how
much we put in mentally, physically,
emotionally and time, and at the end
of the day, everything we give is in
the power of our coach... our happi
ness, our time schedules. That's just
crazy how as a student-athlete, you
have so little control over the events
that happen

in your life."
This lack of control and pro
longed stress can cause more serious
problems: body-image issues and
eating disorders in women and ad
dictive tendencies in men as well as
depression. Detection, and hence
treatment, is especially difficult in
these situations because psychologi
cal conditions and other mental fac
tors can be masked by athletic suc
cess.

While psychologists and psychi
atrists often have to consider how to
treat the negative responses that stu
dent-athletes have to their environ
ments, they also play a role in help
ing the student-athletes optimize
their performance in high-pressure
competition situations.

Rick Schavone, the 35-year
head coach of Stanford's men's and
women's diving teams, never com
peted in diving during his time as a
student-athlete at the University of
New Hampshire. Yet the four-time
NCAA Diving Coach of the Year is

one of the most successful instruc
tors in the sport in large part due to
his approach to the sport through a
psychological lens, one he attained
while earning a sports psychology
degree at Stanford.
Schavone certainly sounded like
a scientist as he surgically broke
down how he prepares his divers to
deal with anxiety in high-pressure
meets.

"Under anxiety, there's an in
creased blood flow to the large mus
cle groups," he said. "So I don't wor
ry if they're not making a dive in
practice, knowing that in the meet
they'll get the extra zip that a mother
gets to take a car off her baby... Un
der anxiety, concentration is more
difficult, so I ask them to focus on
the visual part of the dive."
A particularly interesting con
sideration in diving is the balance be
tween the individual and team com
ponents of the sport. While student
athletes compete as a unit for team
credit, strong individual performanc

es allow a diver to gain recognition
and determine Olympic trial qualifi
cations.

"The weakest way to go to bat
tle is by yourself," Schavone said. "If
a team has cohesion or has good
group dynamics, it's going to have
good performance. At Stanford, get
ting people to follow a leader is not
an easy thing. A lot of the characters
here are strong individuals."
Ultimately, Stanford teams are
utilizing sports psychology more to
optimize student-athlete perform
ance as its recognition and availabili
ty increases for Stanford athletes.
However, awareness of the psycho
logical issues that student-athletes
are often exposed to is important in
order to ensure their mental health.

"Being psychiatrically ill and be
ing an elite athlete does not mix,"
Steiner said. "It's oil and water, and
sooner or later, it catches up to you."

a first-year child psychology fellow in
the School of Medicine, the high
expectations in situations like these
a win being expected in almost
every game often prevent play
ers from feeling rewarded for their
good, consistent performances;
they only feel castigated after a de
feat.

"That can affect not just your
outlook, but your mental state and

happiness," Khan said.
An issue just as pressing for
student-athletes at Stanford is be
ing able to juggle academic and ath
letic responsibilities with the con
stant tug-of-war between the stu
dent-athlete, parents and coach

what Steiner refers to as the "un
holy triad."
"None of these three people
want to have a look at this being too
hard, too demanding, too problemat
ic," Steiner said.
"I remember telling my parents
freshman year that I was being
pulled in a million
different directions," said Haley
Rosen, a junior on the women's soc
cer team. "What's crazy, too, is how
much we put in mentally, physically,
emotionally and time, and at the end
of the day, everything we give is in
the power of our coach... our happi
ness, our time schedules. That's just
crazy how as a student-athlete, you
have so little control over the events
that happen

in your life."
This lack of control and pro
longed stress can cause more serious
problems: body-image issues and
eating disorders in women and ad
dictive tendencies in men as well as
depression. Detection, and hence
treatment, is especially difficult in
these situations because psychologi
cal conditions and other mental fac
tors can be masked by athletic suc
cess.

While psychologists and psychi
atrists often have to consider how to
treat the negative responses that stu
dent-athletes have to their environ
ments, they also play a role in help
ing the student-athletes optimize
their performance in high-pressure
competition situations.

Rick Schavone, the 35-year
head coach of Stanford's men's and
women's diving teams, never com
peted in diving during his time as a
student-athlete at the University of
New Hampshire. Yet the four-time
NCAA Diving Coach of the Year is

one of the most successful instruc
tors in the sport in large part due to
his approach to the sport through a
psychological lens, one he attained
while earning a sports psychology
degree at Stanford.
Schavone certainly sounded like
a scientist as he surgically broke
down how he prepares his divers to
deal with anxiety in high-pressure
meets.

"Under anxiety, there's an in
creased blood flow to the large mus
cle groups," he said. "So I don't wor
ry if they're not making a dive in
practice, knowing that in the meet
they'll get the extra zip that a mother
gets to take a car off her baby... Un
der anxiety, concentration is more
difficult, so I ask them to focus on
the visual part of the dive."
A particularly interesting con
sideration in diving is the balance be
tween the individual and team com
ponents of the sport. While student
athletes compete as a unit for team
credit, strong individual performanc

es allow a diver to gain recognition
and determine Olympic trial qualifi
cations.

"The weakest way to go to bat
tle is by yourself," Schavone said. "If
a team has cohesion or has good
group dynamics, it's going to have
good performance. At Stanford, get
ting people to follow a leader is not
an easy thing. A lot of the characters
here are strong individuals."
Ultimately, Stanford teams are
utilizing sports psychology more to
optimize student-athlete perform
ance as its recognition and availabili
ty increases for Stanford athletes.
However, awareness of the psycho
logical issues that student-athletes
are often exposed to is important in
order to ensure their mental health.

"Being psychiatrically ill and be
ing an elite athlete does not mix,"
Steiner said. "It's oil and water, and
sooner or later, it catches up to you."

Senior kicker Jordan Williamson (right) overcame two late field goal misses at the 2012 Fiesta Bowl to knock off then-No. 2 Oregon at Autzen Stadium in overtime the following season.
With three seconds remaining in regulation and the
score tied at 38, then-sophomore kicker Jordan Williamson
walked out onto the turf at the University of Phoenix Sta
dium. After a career game for Andrew Luck, a Fiesta Bowl
victory and Stanford's 12th win of the 2012 season
was on the line, to be determined by the flight of a football
that was set 35 yards away from the goal posts and almost
perfectly centered between the hashes.
Wide left.

Minutes later, Williamson was given another opportu
nity this time, to put the Cardinal ahead in overtime. It
was a 43-yarder from the right hash.
Wide left.
A football kicker's psyche is often the first example
that comes to mind when fans
consider sports psychology. The field goal seems so rou
tine, with the kicker going through the same motions on
every attempt. Yet any single missed opportunity can send
the athlete's mental state into chaos, starting from the di
rect aftermath of the miss and leading to a complete loss
of confidence and physical ability to kick a field goal.
Williamson's missed kicks in the 2012 Fiesta Bowl
could have led to a career-ending reaction.
"[They could have caused] a traumatic psychopathol
ogy, like post-traumatic stress
disorder," said Hans Steiner, professor emeritus of psychi
atry, "meaning that [the athlete is] experiencing flashes of
the moment."

But 10 months later, Williamson had another massive
opportunity: a 37-yard field goal in overtime at Oregon to
hand the Ducks their first loss and propel the Cardinal to a
potential Rose Bowl berth. This time, the kick was true.
"As soon as I got done being at the bottom of that pile
and I hopped up, I thought to myself, 'Wow. It's been a full
circle. It's practically been a year and the complete opposite
situation'," Williamson said. 'As much as I hated missing
those kicks in the Fiesta Bowl, and as much as I wish the
team had gotten a win and that we would've won the Fiesta
Bowl, I can say, for my personal growth, it was needed."
Dealing with failure is key to performing well as a stu
dent-athlete, especially considering the poise that's often
associated with the role and the high expectations at Stan
ford. The historic success of the women's basketball pro
gram, which has amassed a 768-154 (.833) record in its 28
seasons under head coach Tara VanDerveer, has raised the
team's expectations to extraordinary levels.
"In a sense, almost every game
we go into we're expected to win.
So I think that's the hardest part,
where the pressure is not to lose,"
said senior Toni Kokenis, who has
medically retired and is not playing
this season. "It's almost like you can
get into the mindset of instead of
playing to win—you're playing not
to lose, which is an interesting ten
sion."
