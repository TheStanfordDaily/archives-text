# From injuries to the field: the road of resilience

### Haley Rosen 
//T yaley, you changed your number!" my
Iâ€”l brother said to me after one of my games
X Xthis past season.

"No, Tyler," I responded. "I have been 23 since
freshman year."
It wasn't that Tyler hadn't ever come to one of
my games he was familiar with Stanford soccer.
He had just never actually seen me play.
My name is Haley Rosen, and I am a junior on
the Stanford women's soccer team. In my three
years and 80 possible soccer games at this school, I
have suited up for a total of 11 games. I have
watched the rest from the sidelines accompanied
by a pair of crutches, a boot or a bag of ice on a par
ticular part of my body.
I think it's safe to say that, for whatever reason,
I have had a bit of bad luck with injuries during my
time at Stanford. Despite my mom's various at
tempts "to ward off the evil" (which included vari
ous charm bracelets, necklaces and scents), I have
yet to play a full season here due to three separate
season-ending injuries.
Now, I realize that this sounds like the begin
ning of a sob story and admittedly, there have
been many tears shed over these injuries but I
don't intend to write one. Although I cannot speak
for all athletes, it is my hope that by sharing a little
of my story, I can give some insight into the psycho
logical component of an athlete's injury.
I think that most people can recognize the fact
that injuries are physically painful most people
understand that a broken arm hurts, a torn ligament
hurts, a strained muscle hurts but what often
goes unnoticed is the hurt an injury can cause long
after the physical pain stops. Most athletes that
have made it to this level have fully committed
themselves to their sport. They have missed count
less parties sitting at home hydrating, seen count
less sunrises during their morning workouts and
have routinely spent eight hours traveling to a two
hour game. And in one moment one misstep or
one bad tackle that whole world can turn upside
down. Hopes and dreams evaporate in a matter of
seconds.

Unfortunately, this is a feeling that I'm all too
familiar with.

After all of the time that I have put into this
sport, how did I get here? Three years of Stanford
soccer, with only 1 1 games to show for it. I wonder
how 10-year-old Haley, with posters of Mia Hamm
all over her room, would feel if she knew she would
come so close to her dreams, only to have them
stripped away by injuries. Would she have kept go
ing? Or would she have stopped right there?
Now, I realize that I am being dramatic, and the
reality is that soccer has opened a world of oppor
tunities that would not be there otherwise. I'm at
my dream school, have met the most phenomenal
people and have learned life lessons, skills and abil
ities that I will carry with me for the rest of my life.
And as tough as my Stanford career has been, I have
tried to view it with a "glass-half-full" kind of atti-

The competitor
in me is just not
ready to let go.

Senior forward Haley Rosen knows firsthand the
mental toughness it takes to be knocked down
countless times and to stand back up each time.
Her love for soccer is what keeps her from giving up.
