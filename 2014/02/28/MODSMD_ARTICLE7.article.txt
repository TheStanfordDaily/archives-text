# From injuries to the field: the road of resilience

### Haley Rosen 
//T yaley, you changed your number!" my
I—l brother said to me after one of my games
X Xthis past season.

"No, Tyler," I responded. "I have been 23 since
freshman year."
It wasn't that Tyler hadn't ever come to one of
my games he was familiar with Stanford soccer.
He had just never actually seen me play.
My name is Haley Rosen, and I am a junior on
the Stanford women's soccer team. In my three
years and 80 possible soccer games at this school, I
have suited up for a total of 11 games. I have
watched the rest from the sidelines accompanied
by a pair of crutches, a boot or a bag of ice on a par
ticular part of my body.
I think it's safe to say that, for whatever reason,
I have had a bit of bad luck with injuries during my
time at Stanford. Despite my mom's various at
tempts "to ward off the evil" (which included vari
ous charm bracelets, necklaces and scents), I have
yet to play a full season here due to three separate
season-ending injuries.
Now, I realize that this sounds like the begin
ning of a sob story and admittedly, there have
been many tears shed over these injuries but I
don't intend to write one. Although I cannot speak
for all athletes, it is my hope that by sharing a little
of my story, I can give some insight into the psycho
logical component of an athlete's injury.
I think that most people can recognize the fact
that injuries are physically painful most people
understand that a broken arm hurts, a torn ligament
hurts, a strained muscle hurts but what often
goes unnoticed is the hurt an injury can cause long
after the physical pain stops. Most athletes that
have made it to this level have fully committed
themselves to their sport. They have missed count
less parties sitting at home hydrating, seen count
less sunrises during their morning workouts and
have routinely spent eight hours traveling to a two
hour game. And in one moment one misstep or
one bad tackle that whole world can turn upside
down. Hopes and dreams evaporate in a matter of
seconds.

Unfortunately, this is a feeling that I'm all too
familiar with.

After all of the time that I have put into this
sport, how did I get here? Three years of Stanford
soccer, with only 1 1 games to show for it. I wonder
how 10-year-old Haley, with posters of Mia Hamm
all over her room, would feel if she knew she would
come so close to her dreams, only to have them
stripped away by injuries. Would she have kept go
ing? Or would she have stopped right there?
Now, I realize that I am being dramatic, and the
reality is that soccer has opened a world of oppor
tunities that would not be there otherwise. I'm at
my dream school, have met the most phenomenal
people and have learned life lessons, skills and abil
ities that I will carry with me for the rest of my life.
And as tough as my Stanford career has been, I have
tried to view it with a "glass-half-full" kind of atti-

tude. I've been able to dedicate more effort
to my schoolwork, I've made friends outside
of soccer and I've really been given a new
perspective on everything that Stanford has
to offer outside of athletics.
But this would be difficult for even the
most positive of people. After my third in
jury, a lot of people assumed that I would
quit that coming back for a third time
wouldn't be worth it. And maybe they're
right I'll be a senior, but I might as well be
a redshirt freshman. How can I pour my
heart and soul back into this sport, knowing
this could happen all over again?
I'm not alone in my disappointment. I've
been lucky enough to have a lot of people
supporting me throughout my journey, but
that also means that in tough times, I feel
like I've let down the same people who have
sacrificed so much for my success.
My dad has been there every step of the
way, and I mean literally every step. During
every summer of my collegiate career, he has
done my soccer workouts with me, and he
doesn't just do them he beats the times,
shortens the rests and always wants to do
"one more." Sure, he likes to work out (it
takes him back to his football glory days), but
the main reason he destroys workouts in
tended for D-I athletes 30 years younger
than him is for me to push me to be as
prepared and as good as I can be.
And he's not the only one. So many peo

pie have invested time in me as both a player
and as a person. My coaches have bet on me,
trainers and doctors have helped my recover
ies, friends have let me vent and come to the
few games that I have actually suited up for.
I have a great network of people around me
who I know are proud of me no matter what,
and the amount of time and effort that
everyone has put into my soccer means
more than I can say. But after all that they
have done for me, it's still tough to shake the
feeling that, in addition to letting myself
down, I've let them down.
My journey with soccer has not by any
means been easy, and coming back a third
time may be the most difficult challenge yet.
But the thing is, I love soccer. I love soccer
with every fiber of my being. I didn't play
soccer to go to college, or because my par
ents made me, or for any reason other than
my love of the sport and the competitor
in me is just not ready to let go.
I am a strong believer that everything
happens for a reason. And although right
now, being in the thick of this injury, it is
hard to see what that reason is, I have to be
lieve that the lessons I have learned and the
injuries that I have endured will help me as
my journey continues.
My mom tells me, "Sometimes we need
to go backwards before we can go forward."
I really hope she's right.

//T yaley, you changed your number!" my
I—l brother said to me after one of my games
X Xthis past season.

"No, Tyler," I responded. "I have been 23 since
freshman year."
It wasn't that Tyler hadn't ever come to one of
my games he was familiar with Stanford soccer.
He had just never actually seen me play.
My name is Haley Rosen, and I am a junior on
the Stanford women's soccer team. In my three
years and 80 possible soccer games at this school, I
have suited up for a total of 11 games. I have
watched the rest from the sidelines accompanied
by a pair of crutches, a boot or a bag of ice on a par
ticular part of my body.
I think it's safe to say that, for whatever reason,
I have had a bit of bad luck with injuries during my
time at Stanford. Despite my mom's various at
tempts "to ward off the evil" (which included vari
ous charm bracelets, necklaces and scents), I have
yet to play a full season here due to three separate
season-ending injuries.
Now, I realize that this sounds like the begin
ning of a sob story and admittedly, there have
been many tears shed over these injuries but I
don't intend to write one. Although I cannot speak
for all athletes, it is my hope that by sharing a little
of my story, I can give some insight into the psycho
logical component of an athlete's injury.
I think that most people can recognize the fact
that injuries are physically painful most people
understand that a broken arm hurts, a torn ligament
hurts, a strained muscle hurts but what often
goes unnoticed is the hurt an injury can cause long
after the physical pain stops. Most athletes that
have made it to this level have fully committed
themselves to their sport. They have missed count
less parties sitting at home hydrating, seen count
less sunrises during their morning workouts and
have routinely spent eight hours traveling to a two
hour game. And in one moment one misstep or
one bad tackle that whole world can turn upside
down. Hopes and dreams evaporate in a matter of
seconds.

Unfortunately, this is a feeling that I'm all too
familiar with.

After all of the time that I have put into this
sport, how did I get here? Three years of Stanford
soccer, with only 1 1 games to show for it. I wonder
how 10-year-old Haley, with posters of Mia Hamm
all over her room, would feel if she knew she would
come so close to her dreams, only to have them
stripped away by injuries. Would she have kept go
ing? Or would she have stopped right there?
Now, I realize that I am being dramatic, and the
reality is that soccer has opened a world of oppor
tunities that would not be there otherwise. I'm at
my dream school, have met the most phenomenal
people and have learned life lessons, skills and abil
ities that I will carry with me for the rest of my life.
And as tough as my Stanford career has been, I have
tried to view it with a "glass-half-full" kind of atti-

The competitor
in me is just not

tude. I've been able to dedicate more effort
to my schoolwork, I've made friends outside
of soccer and I've really been given a new
perspective on everything that Stanford has
to offer outside of athletics.
But this would be difficult for even the
most positive of people. After my third in
jury, a lot of people assumed that I would
quit that coming back for a third time
wouldn't be worth it. And maybe they're
right I'll be a senior, but I might as well be
a redshirt freshman. How can I pour my
heart and soul back into this sport, knowing
this could happen all over again?
I'm not alone in my disappointment. I've
been lucky enough to have a lot of people
supporting me throughout my journey, but
that also means that in tough times, I feel
like I've let down the same people who have
sacrificed so much for my success.
My dad has been there every step of the
way, and I mean literally every step. During
every summer of my collegiate career, he has
done my soccer workouts with me, and he
doesn't just do them he beats the times,
shortens the rests and always wants to do
"one more." Sure, he likes to work out (it
takes him back to his football glory days), but
the main reason he destroys workouts in
tended for D-I athletes 30 years younger
than him is for me to push me to be as
prepared and as good as I can be.
And he's not the only one. So many peo

pie have invested time in me as both a player
and as a person. My coaches have bet on me,
trainers and doctors have helped my recover
ies, friends have let me vent and come to the
few games that I have actually suited up for.
I have a great network of people around me
who I know are proud of me no matter what,
and the amount of time and effort that
everyone has put into my soccer means
more than I can say. But after all that they
have done for me, it's still tough to shake the
feeling that, in addition to letting myself
down, I've let them down.
My journey with soccer has not by any
means been easy, and coming back a third
time may be the most difficult challenge yet.
But the thing is, I love soccer. I love soccer
with every fiber of my being. I didn't play
soccer to go to college, or because my par
ents made me, or for any reason other than
my love of the sport and the competitor
in me is just not ready to let go.
I am a strong believer that everything
happens for a reason. And although right
now, being in the thick of this injury, it is
hard to see what that reason is, I have to be
lieve that the lessons I have learned and the
injuries that I have endured will help me as
my journey continues.
My mom tells me, "Sometimes we need
to go backwards before we can go forward."
I really hope she's right.
