## How to stop 10,000 students from snooping through your files 
### Emma Pierson 
Every Stanford student is given a
computer account which allows
them to store and manipulate
files using Stanford's computers. After
inspecting this system, known as AFS,
I suspected it might be possible for
anyone with an account to do two
things:

1. Rapidly harvest the Stanford
email address of every single student
(and many alumni), enabling them to
potentially spam tens of thousands of
people.

2. Read the filenames for ex
ample, "meganfox.jpg" that every
student had stored in the home direc
tories of their Stanford accounts (un
less the students had know-how to ex
plicitly make those filenames private; I
describe how to do this at the end of
the article).
While for obvious reasons I'll skip
the technical details of how one could

do this, I wrote to Stanford's IT servic
es (ITS) and they confirmed this was
the case. This is not ITS's fault: they
didn't design AFS (Carnegie Mellon
did) and fixing an established system is
hard. When I wrote to ITS, they re
sponded rapidly and professionally,
convincing me that there was no easy
fix.
I would nonetheless suggest that
this system is worth modifying be
cause both the email addresses and
the filenames invite abuses.
Firstly, people have attempted to
harvest student emails in the past, and
unscrupulous ASSU candidates, start
up founders or anyone who's ever
used the phrase "FORWARD WIDELY"
might do it in the future. One could al
so sell the addresses to a spam list.
(Stanford does use an anti-spam sys-
tem and other email controls to mitigate this
problem.)
Secondly, being able to access filenames
allows you, in many cases, to determine what
classes a student is taking, and this could
make a large-scale demographic analysis pos
sible. Do students with female-sounding IDs
take different classes than students with
male-sounding IDs? What about students
whose ethnic backgrounds are identifiable
from their IDs? This isn't the sort of analysis
that Stanford wants to allow I know be
cause ITS got annoyed when I asked.
More pernicious are the potential dan
gers posed to individual students. One could
investigate whether specific athletes are tak
ing different classes from the general popula
tion. One could also look at whether children
of famous parents take different classes, a
question that those who scrutinize legacy ad
missions would be interested in.

It also would be easy to search for embar
rassing filenames: I'd be willing to bet a lot of
money that one of the many thousands of
AFS users is storing porn. Even students who
aren't that technically sophisticated could in
vestigate individual acquaintances do you
really want your embittered ex going through
your computer? While most students proba
bly save their most private files on laptops,
should students who can't afford laptops have
a lesser expectation of privacy?
And beyond schoolwork and porn, there
may be a lot of confidential, high-value data
stored on AFS unpublished research,
ideas for companies and so on. Having
worked at tech companies, I can attest that
even a quick scan of a company's filenames
gives a lot of clues as to the directions it's ex
ploring.
I strongly advise against attempting
to do any of this. Ignoring the fact that it's a
massive violation of trust, Stanford monitors
AFS usage and ITS has made it clear that they
will pursue offenders. But enforcement will
naturally be imperfect, since it may be hard
to discriminate between valid cluster usage
and large-scale harvesting.
Ideally, Stanford students and affiliates
should know that their filenames and emails
cannot be harvested by one of the thousands
of other users on the system and not have to
trust the goodwill of others or retroactive
sanctions. While this problem is not easy to
fix, it is also not unfixable: The NSA, for ex

ample, probably doesn't allow all its employ
ees to access all its filenames. While it is true
that in some cases we relax privacy for con
venience, it's unclear what legitimate reason
someone would have for reading other stu
dents' filenames if they cannot open the files
themselves.

So I am writing this article for two rea
sons: First, to make you aware of the problem
so you can protect yourself. There is no way
to prevent your email address from being har
vested, but you can make your filenames pri
vate quite easily:
If you have a Mac:
1. Click on the "Terminal" application.
This might be a black square at the bottom
of the screen. If you can't find it there, you
can click on the magnifying glass in the
top right corner of the screen and then
type "Terminal" to search for Terminal.
2. A little box should pop up. Click on
it and log into your Stanford AFS account
by typing "ssh username@corn.stanford.
edu" where you replace "username" with
your SUID. Press enter. You will have to
enter your password.
3. Once you have logged in, type in
"fsr setacl ~ system:campushosts none"
and press enter. Your files are now hidden
from other students.

If you do not have a Mac:
1. Go to a computer in one of the
Stanford labs and log on using the Mac op
erating system; follow the instructions
above.

You can find a more detailed explanation
of what these commands do on the ITS web
site. If this sounds too complicated, there are
a number of other fixes: your AFS account al
so gives you access to a "private" folder, and
anything placed in there will be hidden from
other students. Alternately, you can store
files on Google Docs or Stanford Box, neither
of which can be seen by other students. Or
you could give all your files very boring
names ("not_kitty_cat_porn.png").
The second reason I am writing this arti
cle is my faith in the technical know-how of
the Stanford community: I believe this sys
tem can be improved, and hopefully one of
you will, too. Looking for a summer project?
