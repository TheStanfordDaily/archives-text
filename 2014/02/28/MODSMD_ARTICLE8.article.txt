## How to stop 10,000 students from snooping through your files 
### Emma Pierson 
Every Stanford student is given a
computer account which allows
them to store and manipulate
files using Stanford's computers. After
inspecting this system, known as AFS,
I suspected it might be possible for
anyone with an account to do two
things:

1. Rapidly harvest the Stanford
email address of every single student
(and many alumni), enabling them to
potentially spam tens of thousands of
people.

2. Read the filenames for ex
ample, "meganfox.jpg" that every
student had stored in the home direc
tories of their Stanford accounts (un
less the students had know-how to ex
plicitly make those filenames private; I
describe how to do this at the end of
the article).
While for obvious reasons I'll skip
the technical details of how one could

do this, I wrote to Stanford's IT servic
es (ITS) and they confirmed this was
the case. This is not ITS's fault: they
didn't design AFS (Carnegie Mellon
did) and fixing an established system is
hard. When I wrote to ITS, they re
sponded rapidly and professionally,
convincing me that there was no easy
fix.
I would nonetheless suggest that
this system is worth modifying be
cause both the email addresses and
the filenames invite abuses.
Firstly, people have attempted to
harvest student emails in the past, and
unscrupulous ASSU candidates, start
up founders or anyone who's ever
used the phrase "FORWARD WIDELY"
might do it in the future. One could al
so sell the addresses to a spam list.
