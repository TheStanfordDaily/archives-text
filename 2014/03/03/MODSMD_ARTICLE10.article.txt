# WILDCAT ROMP
## 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's basketball team (18-
0, 9-7 Pac-12) knew that if it was going to
come away with a victory on the road against
No. 3 Arizona, it was going to have to play its
best basketball of the season. Unfortunately
for the Cardinal, Stanford could not muster
its best effort, particularly early on, result
ing in a 79-66 loss to the Wildcats (27-2,14-2)
on Sunday night.
Arizona clinched a Pac-12 title outright
with the victory, giving coach Sean Miller
and the Wildcats their second conference
crown in four seasons. It was Arizona's ninth
consecutive win against Stanford, a stretch
dating back to Jan. 4, 2009, and barring a
postseason meeting between these two
teams, Arizona will remain the only confer
ence opponent that Stanford's departing
senior class of Josh Huestis, Dwight Powell,
John Gage, Aaron Bright, Andy Brown, An
thony Brown and Robbie Lemons has failed
to defeat during its time on the Farm.
The same slow start that doomed the
Cardinal against Arizona State on Wednes
day was again the issue for Stanford on Sun
day, as the underdogs fell behind early and
never recovered. Arizona jumped out to a
13-4 lead in the first five minutes of the
game, thanks in large part to Stanford's
sloppy offensive execution, and never looked
back. The Wildcats extended the lead to as

in scoring. His performance last night followed a Pac- 12 Player of the Week honor.
much as 18 in the first half before a
five-point spurt by Anthony Brown
cut the margin to 13 at halftime.
Stanford shot just 36 percent
in the first half and turned the
ball over eight times, including
seven times in the first ten min
utes of the game. Against a team,
and a defense, of Arizona's cal
iber, that simply wasn't going to
do it for the Cardinal.
The Cardinal wasted another
terrific effort by Huestis, the
reigning Pac-12 Player of the
Week, who finished with 22 points
and 12 rebounds in the loss, mark
ing the second time in a week that
Huestis has matched his career
high in points. It was also the sen
ior forward's seventh double-dou
ble effort of the year, tying him
with fellow senior Dwight Powell
for most on the team this season.
Brown had yet another solid
outing for Stanford, finishing with
14 points on 5-of-7 shooting to go
with six rebounds and four as
sists. The problem for Stanford
was that outside of its starting
wings, few others performed to
the level necessary to compete
with a top-three team in its home
arena.
Outside of Huestis and Brown,
the rest of the Cardinal shot just
27.3 percent. Stanford's bench
was once again invisible, as five
reserves combined for just four

points, two rebounds, one assist,
one steal and one block plus
two turnovers and five fouls in
55 minutes of play. This lack of
production continually places a
heavy burden on Stanford's start
ing five, and it was on full display
on Sunday when three-fifths of
Stanford's first unit struggled.
Powell struggled mightily for
most of the game, shooting just 3-
of-13 from the floor on his way to
12 points and eight rebounds.
Junior Chasson Randle, the
team's leading scorer at 18.8
points per game, finished well shy
of his season average by scoring
just 12 points. He also added four
turnovers to Stanford's tally, all of
them coming during the Cardi
nal's disastrous first half.
Redshirt junior Stefan Nastic
fouled out while only playing 13
minutes. He finished with just two
points on l-of-7 shooting.
Star freshman Aaron Gordon,
who had 19 points and a career
high 15 rebounds, and junior T.J.
McConnell, who added 14 points
and four assists, led Arizona on
Sunday night. The two anchored a
swarming defensive unit that cre
ated all kinds of havoc for Stan
ford's offense and continues to
shut down opposing offenses.
The Cardinal will look to get
back on the winning track in its
quest for an NCAA tournament
berth in its final two games of the
regular season next week, when it
hosts Colorado and Utah.

The Stanford men's basketball team (18-
0, 9-7 Pac-12) knew that if it was going to
come away with a victory on the road against
No. 3 Arizona, it was going to have to play its
best basketball of the season. Unfortunately
for the Cardinal, Stanford could not muster
its best effort, particularly early on, result
ing in a 79-66 loss to the Wildcats (27-2,14-2)
on Sunday night.
Arizona clinched a Pac-12 title outright
with the victory, giving coach Sean Miller
and the Wildcats their second conference
crown in four seasons. It was Arizona's ninth
consecutive win against Stanford, a stretch
dating back to Jan. 4, 2009, and barring a
postseason meeting between these two
teams, Arizona will remain the only confer
ence opponent that Stanford's departing
senior class of Josh Huestis, Dwight Powell,
John Gage, Aaron Bright, Andy Brown, An
thony Brown and Robbie Lemons has failed
to defeat during its time on the Farm.
The same slow start that doomed the
Cardinal against Arizona State on Wednes
day was again the issue for Stanford on Sun
day, as the underdogs fell behind early and
never recovered. Arizona jumped out to a
13-4 lead in the first five minutes of the
game, thanks in large part to Stanford's
sloppy offensive execution, and never looked
back. The Wildcats extended the lead to as

in scoring. His performance last night followed a Pac- 12 Player of the Week honor.
much as 18 in the first half before a
five-point spurt by Anthony Brown
cut the margin to 13 at halftime.
Stanford shot just 36 percent
in the first half and turned the
ball over eight times, including
seven times in the first ten min
utes of the game. Against a team,
and a defense, of Arizona's cal
iber, that simply wasn't going to
do it for the Cardinal.
The Cardinal wasted another
terrific effort by Huestis, the
reigning Pac-12 Player of the
Week, who finished with 22 points
and 12 rebounds in the loss, mark
ing the second time in a week that
Huestis has matched his career
high in points. It was also the sen
ior forward's seventh double-dou
ble effort of the year, tying him
with fellow senior Dwight Powell
for most on the team this season.
Brown had yet another solid
outing for Stanford, finishing with
14 points on 5-of-7 shooting to go
with six rebounds and four as
sists. The problem for Stanford
was that outside of its starting
wings, few others performed to
the level necessary to compete
with a top-three team in its home
arena.
Outside of Huestis and Brown,
the rest of the Cardinal shot just
27.3 percent. Stanford's bench
was once again invisible, as five
reserves combined for just four

points, two rebounds, one assist,
one steal and one block plus
two turnovers and five fouls in
55 minutes of play. This lack of
production continually places a
heavy burden on Stanford's start
ing five, and it was on full display
on Sunday when three-fifths of
Stanford's first unit struggled.
Powell struggled mightily for
most of the game, shooting just 3-
of-13 from the floor on his way to
12 points and eight rebounds.
Junior Chasson Randle, the
team's leading scorer at 18.8
points per game, finished well shy
of his season average by scoring
just 12 points. He also added four
turnovers to Stanford's tally, all of
them coming during the Cardi
nal's disastrous first half.
Redshirt junior Stefan Nastic
fouled out while only playing 13
minutes. He finished with just two
points on l-of-7 shooting.
Star freshman Aaron Gordon,
who had 19 points and a career
high 15 rebounds, and junior T.J.
McConnell, who added 14 points
and four assists, led Arizona on
Sunday night. The two anchored a
swarming defensive unit that cre
ated all kinds of havoc for Stan
ford's offense and continues to
shut down opposing offenses.
The Cardinal will look to get
back on the winning track in its
quest for an NCAA tournament
berth in its final two games of the
regular season next week, when it
hosts Colorado and Utah.
