postseason meeting between these two
teams, Arizona will remain the only confer

senior class of Josh Huestis, Dwight Powell,
John Gage, Aaron Bright, Andy Brown, An
thony Brown and Robbie Lemons has failed
to defeat during its time on the Farm.

Cardinal against Arizona State on Wednes
day was again the issue for Stanford on Sun

13-4 lead in the first five minutes of the

sloppy offensive execution, and never looked
back. The Wildcats extended the lead to as
