## Swept on road by Vandy 
### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
Continuing its tough nonconfer
ence slate, Stanford baseball trav
eled to Nashville, Tenn. this week
end in hopes of making a statement
against a consensus top-10 team.
However, the Cardinal bats fell
silent against Vanderbilt's dominant
pitching staff, which allowed just
four combined runs in the series, as
Stanford (4-7) was swept falling
4-1 on Friday, 5-1 on Saturday and 4-
2 on Sunday.

Vanderbilt (10-2) entered the
weekend series with a 1.56 team
ERA and a .170 opponents' batting
average, so the Cardinal offense had
an idea of what was coming, but it
simply did not have any answers.
The team hit just .157 (14-for-89)
over the three-game set and struck
out 25 times nearly a quarter of
its plate appearances contribut
ing to a 23.8 percent team strikeout
rate.
Even improved outings by the
Cardinal pitching staff, which had a
2.25 ERA over the weekend, could
not make up for the team's other
miscues, as sloppy defense on Sun
day spoiled Stanford's best opportu
nity to salvage a win. But despite the
run prevention, inopportune lapses
in command a developing trend
from the young staff â€”led to the
Commodores pushing some key
runs across the plate.
"We still walked too many peo
ple. We didn't do much with the
bats," said head coach Mark Mar
quess. "We pitched a little bit better
the freshmen pitched a little bit
better but we still had way too
many walks."
The 20 walks allowed against
Vanderbilt built on Stanford's prob
lem of creating its own jams thus far
this season, as the team's 1.58
WHIP exceeds last season's mark
by 0.25 equating to an extra two
runners on per game.
Both Friday's and Saturday's
games were similar in that although
the Cardinal pitching was able to
avoid the big letdown inning, the of
fense was simply unable to get any
thing going.
Freshman Brett Hanewich got
the start on Friday after the starting
rotation was bumped up one when
freshman Cal Quantrill made Tues
day's start against San Francisco.
He threw 97 pitches, allowing four
runs three earned over five in
nings, and departed with a 4-1
deficit, ultimately the final score.
Vanderbilt's ace, junior Tyler
Beede who previously struck out
18 hitters over 11 innings in his first
two starts pitched seven innings,
