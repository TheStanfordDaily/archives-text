## Swept on road by Vandy 
### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
Continuing its tough nonconfer
ence slate, Stanford baseball trav
eled to Nashville, Tenn. this week
end in hopes of making a statement
against a consensus top-10 team.
However, the Cardinal bats fell
silent against Vanderbilt's dominant
pitching staff, which allowed just
four combined runs in the series, as
Stanford (4-7) was swept falling
4-1 on Friday, 5-1 on Saturday and 4-
2 on Sunday.

Vanderbilt (10-2) entered the
weekend series with a 1.56 team
ERA and a .170 opponents' batting
average, so the Cardinal offense had
an idea of what was coming, but it
simply did not have any answers.
The team hit just .157 (14-for-89)
over the three-game set and struck
out 25 times nearly a quarter of
its plate appearances contribut
ing to a 23.8 percent team strikeout
rate.
Even improved outings by the
Cardinal pitching staff, which had a
2.25 ERA over the weekend, could
not make up for the team's other
miscues, as sloppy defense on Sun
day spoiled Stanford's best opportu
nity to salvage a win. But despite the
run prevention, inopportune lapses
in command a developing trend
from the young staff â€”led to the
Commodores pushing some key
runs across the plate.
"We still walked too many peo
ple. We didn't do much with the
bats," said head coach Mark Mar
quess. "We pitched a little bit better
the freshmen pitched a little bit
better but we still had way too
many walks."
The 20 walks allowed against
Vanderbilt built on Stanford's prob
lem of creating its own jams thus far
this season, as the team's 1.58
WHIP exceeds last season's mark
by 0.25 equating to an extra two
runners on per game.
Both Friday's and Saturday's
games were similar in that although
the Cardinal pitching was able to
avoid the big letdown inning, the of
fense was simply unable to get any
thing going.
Freshman Brett Hanewich got
the start on Friday after the starting
rotation was bumped up one when
freshman Cal Quantrill made Tues
day's start against San Francisco.
He threw 97 pitches, allowing four
runs three earned over five in
nings, and departed with a 4-1
deficit, ultimately the final score.
Vanderbilt's ace, junior Tyler
Beede who previously struck out
18 hitters over 11 innings in his first
two starts pitched seven innings,

allowing just three hits to
the Stanford hitters and
striking out six.
Senior reliever A.J. Vane
gas made his second appear
ance of the season coming off
of a back injury, throwing a
scoreless eighth inning in
just 11 pitches.
On Saturday, freshman
Chris Viall and sophomore
Logan James combined to al
low five runs over seven in
nings of work, but a lack of
offensive opportunities once
again led to the Com
modores' cruising to a 5-1
win.
Sophomore outfielder
Zach Hoffpauir, who provid
ed two of Stanford's three
hits in the game, cut Vander
bilt's lead to 2-1 in the fifth
inning with an RBI triple
that scored sophomore
Austin Barr. But Vanderbilt
quickly answered back with a
run in the bottom half and
never looked back.
Junior Alex Blandino had
a nine-game hitting streak
snapped in the loss and
freshman Tommy Edman
had a seven-game on-base
streak snapped as well.
Quantrill got the Sunday
staii and had an impressive
outing in the rain, throwing a
season-high 91 pitches, last
ing five innings and only al
lowing one earned run.

"He threw more strikes
and he got his breaking ball
and changeup over, which
made him more effective, so
it was probably his best out
ing of the year," Marquess
said.

With the Commodores up
2-0 in the top of the seventh,
the Cardinal began to threat
en. After loading the bases
with the first three hitters,
sophomore Wayne Taylor
had a sacrifice fly to close the
lead to 2-1. Two batters later,
after a walk and a strikeout,
junior Danny Diekroeger
stepped up with the bases
loaded and two gone. He
drew a walk with the bases
loaded after falling behind in
the count 1-2, tying the game
at two.
But in the bottom of the
eighth, sophomore Marcus
Brakeman broke after hav
ing entered in relief earlier in

the game, walking four bat
ters and forcing a go-ahead
run. A hit-by-pitch later in
the inning by freshman Tyler
Thorne with the bases loaded
forced in another run, giving
Vanderbilt a 4-2 advantage.
The Cardinal loaded the
bases in the top of the ninth,
getting the tying ran to scor
ing position with two outs
and Blandino up as the
team's last chance. But a fly
out to right field ended the
game at 4-2 and closed out
the series.
Stanford's first time be
ing swept this season also de
layed a milestone for Mar
quess, who only needs one

more win to reach the
plateau of 1,500 a mark
only six other coaches have
ever reached.
After two consecutive
weekend road trips, the Car
dinal will stay in the Bay
Area for the next month,
hosting its final nonconfer
ence series against Kansas
and the start of Pac-12 play
after the Finals Week break.
First, however, the team will
travel to Berkeley this Tues
day to take on Cal at 6 p.m.
in a contest televised by the
Pac-12 Networks.
