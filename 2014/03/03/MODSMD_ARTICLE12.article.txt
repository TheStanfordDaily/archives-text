# POSITIVE OUTLOOK FOR OFFENSE
## 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
Three hundred and thirty carries for 1,709 yards
and 21 touchdowns.
That's what the Stanford Cardinal will be looking
to replace in its running game heading into 2014 with
the departure of senior tailback Tyler Gaffney, pre
sumably to the NFL. But don't think for a second that
having to do so is unfamiliar to the Cardinal by any
means, given that it has seemingly had this exact
problem twice in the last half-decade.
Following the 2009 season, the team lost al
most 2,000 yards of rushing when Toby Gerhart
'O9 was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings. When

that happened, Stepfan Taylor 'l3 stepped up and
became Stanford's all-time rushing leader. When Tay
lor, in turn, was drafted by the Arizona Cardinals fol
lowing the 2012 season, Gaffney returned from base
ball to become the stalwart out of Stanford's backfield.
With Gaffney now departing, the void has once again
opened and this time, it's sophomore Barry Sanders,
junior Remound Wright, junior Kelsey Young and sen
ior Ricky Seale that "ill be competing to be next in line
to tote the rock.
"Everybody wants to be 'that guy'," Young said.

FOOTBALL NOTES
"Everybody wants to replicate or
just replace what Gaffney was doing
last year, so everybody is on their
toes, making sure that they're at the
prime spot of their game to be 'that
guy.' So it makes the competition
that much better."
All four of the running backs
competing for the spot saw ample
time with the first-team offense at
Saturday morning's open practice
after having started to work with
new running backs coach Lance
Taylor. While Sanders, Seale and
Wright all got touches out of the
backfield last season, Young is a new
addition to the stable after having
seen action in a hybrid wide receiv
er/running back role, predominant
ly taking or faking end-arounds in
Stanford's "wildcat" package.
"I think it makes me a lot more
well-rounded because I have the in
sight of what everything is doing,"
said Young about his time in the
unique role. "I'm really fluid in the
offense. I don't just understand
what we're doing up front with the
line and the run game; I understand
what the receivers are doing. That
actually helps me in terms of setting
up my blocks and understanding
why I'm doing what I'm doing in
stead of just running through the
motions."
And for Young, who was recruit
ed as a running back, the brief ex
cursion out of the role does not look
to be too much of a hindrance to his
future at the position.
"My whole life has been running
between the tackles and everything
like that, so I guess the only big
transition is running between the
tackles of college because there's a
lot more bigger guys than I'm used
to," Young said. "I've just got to
make sure that I keep my shoulders
low and don't hesitate, just hit the
hole fast."

The mental command of the po
sition that Young will be looking to
regain this spring was on full dis
play on Saturday along with his
standout speed and agility, as he
showed his ability to find his seams
and break tackles for extra yardage
during his practice snaps. In the in
tra-squad scrimmage that ended
the practice, Young unofficially had
two carries for 14 yards while also
catching a screen pass that he broke
free for a 20-yard gain.
After the practice, head coach
David Shaw praised Young for his
big-play ability out of the backfield.

Because no clear front-runner has
emerged this early on, Shaw cited
pass protection as one of the factors
that differentiated the skills of the
different backs, naming Wright as
the most advanced player in that re
gard. Young identified pass protec
tion as the element of his game that
he would specifically focus on mov
ing forward throughout these
spring practices.

One position group that did not
lose talent to graduation this offsea
son was the wide receiving corps,
with only sophomore Kodi Whitfield
who switched to safety failing
to return among last season's top
six wide receivers.
"Having everyone coming back
almost everyone that's just
such a plus," said freshman wideout
Francis Owusu. "We have one of the
deepest receiving corps in the nation
and one of the best, led by Ty Mont
gomery, Devon Cajuste and [Jor
dan] Pratt, so those guys, they're
just looking out for me and other
guys."
Owusu, who played predomi
nantly on special teams last season
but still lined up at wide receiver at
times, saw significant time with the
first-team offense on Saturday. Af
ter catching two passes for 56 yards
both coming late in Big Game, in
cluding a touchdown Owusu will
look to take on a larger role in Stan
ford's receiving game this season.
The freshman will enter next
season already having familiarized

himself with Stanford's playbook
and big-game experience that
helped him gain confidence within
the system.
"I'm not second-guessing myself
anymore," Owusu said. "I'm running
to the line knowing exactly what I'm
doing before, so that definitely helps
me run fast."
Owusu has been working with
the recently promoted quarterbacks
and wide receivers coach Tavita
Pritchard on the "minute details" of
his game to get more separation
from defensive backs at the top of
his routes. Moving forward through
spring practice, he will also be work
ing hard to improve his blocking,
particularly of bigger defenders like
linebackers.

After Stanford's tight ends
stayed relatively quiet last season,
an up-and-coming trio of freshmen
Eric Cotton, Austin Hooper and
Greg Taboadaâ€” will be looking to
change that. Cotton was participat
ing in many of the offensive drills as
a slot receiver, while Taboada caught
a difficult touchdown pass from jun
ior Evan Grower during the intra
squad scrimmage. Hooper missed
the open practice due to an academ
ic field trip.
Stanford's next open practice will
take place at 9 a.m. on March 8.

an up-and-coming trio of freshmen
Eric Cotton, Austin Hooper and
Greg Taboadaâ€” will be looking to
change that. Cotton was participat
ing in many of the offensive drills as
a slot receiver, while Taboada caught
a difficult touchdown pass from jun
ior Evan Grower during the intra
squad scrimmage. Hooper missed
the open practice due to an academ
ic field trip.
Stanford's next open practice will
take place at 9 a.m. on March 8.

Junior running back Kelsey Young (right) will compete with sophomore
Barry Sanders, junior Remound Wright and senior Ricky Seale to fill the
void left by senior workhorse Tyler Gaffney's departure to the NFL Draft.
Three hundred and thirty carries for 1,709 yards
and 21 touchdowns.
That's what the Stanford Cardinal will be looking
to replace in its running game heading into 2014 with
the departure of senior tailback Tyler Gaffney, pre
sumably to the NFL. But don't think for a second that
having to do so is unfamiliar to the Cardinal by any
means, given that it has seemingly had this exact
problem twice in the last half-decade.
Following the 2009 season, the team lost al
most 2,000 yards of rushing when Toby Gerhart
'O9 was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings. When

that happened, Stepfan Taylor 'l3 stepped up and
became Stanford's all-time rushing leader. When Tay
lor, in turn, was drafted by the Arizona Cardinals fol
lowing the 2012 season, Gaffney returned from base
ball to become the stalwart out of Stanford's backfield.
With Gaffney now departing, the void has once again
opened and this time, it's sophomore Barry Sanders,
junior Remound Wright, junior Kelsey Young and sen
ior Ricky Seale that "ill be competing to be next in line
to tote the rock.
"Everybody wants to be 'that guy'," Young said.

FOOTBALL NOTES
"Everybody wants to replicate or
just replace what Gaffney was doing
last year, so everybody is on their
toes, making sure that they're at the
prime spot of their game to be 'that
guy.' So it makes the competition
that much better."
All four of the running backs
competing for the spot saw ample
time with the first-team offense at
Saturday morning's open practice
after having started to work with
new running backs coach Lance
Taylor. While Sanders, Seale and
Wright all got touches out of the
backfield last season, Young is a new
addition to the stable after having
seen action in a hybrid wide receiv
er/running back role, predominant
ly taking or faking end-arounds in
Stanford's "wildcat" package.
"I think it makes me a lot more
well-rounded because I have the in
sight of what everything is doing,"
said Young about his time in the
unique role. "I'm really fluid in the
offense. I don't just understand
what we're doing up front with the
line and the run game; I understand
what the receivers are doing. That
actually helps me in terms of setting
up my blocks and understanding
why I'm doing what I'm doing in
stead of just running through the
motions."
And for Young, who was recruit
ed as a running back, the brief ex
cursion out of the role does not look
to be too much of a hindrance to his
future at the position.
"My whole life has been running
between the tackles and everything
like that, so I guess the only big
transition is running between the
tackles of college because there's a
lot more bigger guys than I'm used
to," Young said. "I've just got to
make sure that I keep my shoulders
low and don't hesitate, just hit the
hole fast."

The mental command of the po
sition that Young will be looking to
regain this spring was on full dis
play on Saturday along with his
standout speed and agility, as he
showed his ability to find his seams
and break tackles for extra yardage
during his practice snaps. In the in
tra-squad scrimmage that ended
the practice, Young unofficially had
two carries for 14 yards while also
catching a screen pass that he broke
free for a 20-yard gain.
After the practice, head coach
David Shaw praised Young for his
big-play ability out of the backfield.

Because no clear front-runner has
emerged this early on, Shaw cited
pass protection as one of the factors
that differentiated the skills of the
different backs, naming Wright as
the most advanced player in that re
gard. Young identified pass protec
tion as the element of his game that
he would specifically focus on mov
ing forward throughout these
spring practices.

One position group that did not
lose talent to graduation this offsea
son was the wide receiving corps,
with only sophomore Kodi Whitfield
who switched to safety failing
to return among last season's top
six wide receivers.
"Having everyone coming back
almost everyone that's just
such a plus," said freshman wideout
Francis Owusu. "We have one of the
deepest receiving corps in the nation
and one of the best, led by Ty Mont
gomery, Devon Cajuste and [Jor
dan] Pratt, so those guys, they're
just looking out for me and other
guys."
Owusu, who played predomi
nantly on special teams last season
but still lined up at wide receiver at
times, saw significant time with the
first-team offense on Saturday. Af
ter catching two passes for 56 yards
both coming late in Big Game, in
cluding a touchdown Owusu will
look to take on a larger role in Stan
ford's receiving game this season.
The freshman will enter next
season already having familiarized

himself with Stanford's playbook
and big-game experience that
helped him gain confidence within
the system.
"I'm not second-guessing myself
anymore," Owusu said. "I'm running
to the line knowing exactly what I'm
doing before, so that definitely helps
me run fast."
Owusu has been working with
the recently promoted quarterbacks
and wide receivers coach Tavita
Pritchard on the "minute details" of
his game to get more separation
from defensive backs at the top of
his routes. Moving forward through
spring practice, he will also be work
ing hard to improve his blocking,
particularly of bigger defenders like
linebackers.
