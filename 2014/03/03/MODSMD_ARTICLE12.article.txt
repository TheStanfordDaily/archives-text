# POSITIVE OUTLOOK FOR OFFENSE

Three hundred and thirty carries for 1,709 yards
and 21 touchdowns.
That's what the Stanford Cardinal will be looking
to replace in its running game heading into 2014 with
the departure of senior tailback Tyler Gaffney, pre
sumably to the NFL. But don't think for a second that
having to do so is unfamiliar to the Cardinal by any
means, given that it has seemingly had this exact
problem twice in the last half-decade.
Following the 2009 season, the team lost al
most 2,000 yards of rushing when Toby Gerhart
'O9 was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings. When

that happened, Stepfan Taylor 'l3 stepped up and
became Stanford's all-time rushing leader. When Tay
lor, in turn, was drafted by the Arizona Cardinals fol
lowing the 2012 season, Gaffney returned from base
ball to become the stalwart out of Stanford's backfield.
With Gaffney now departing, the void has once again
opened and this time, it's sophomore Barry Sanders,
junior Remound Wright, junior Kelsey Young and sen
ior Ricky Seale that "ill be competing to be next in line
to tote the rock.
"Everybody wants to be 'that guy'," Young said.
