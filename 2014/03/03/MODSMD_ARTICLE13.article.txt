# Senior night success

### LAUREN LOCKETT STAFF WRITER 
The No. 5 Stanford women's
basketball team (28-2,17-1 Pac-12)
closed its regular season in out
standing fashion over the weekend
by easily handling both of its Pac
-12 foes from the state of Washing
ton at Maples Pavilion. On Thurs
day, Stanford trumped the Wash
ington Huskies (16-12, 9-8) by a
score of 83-60 and continued the
domination with an 84-64 victory of
the Washington State Cougars (15-
15,9-9) on Saturday.

The Cardinal had payback on
its mind in Thursday's contest
against Washington, which had
handed Stanford its only Pac-12
loss of the season on Feb. 9. With
stifling defense, the Stanford
squad held the Huskies to 37 per
cent from the field and made sure
that the Huskies didn't repeat their
impressive offensive performance
from last month.

On the offensive side of the ball,
Stanford was led by its All-Ameri
can and National Player of the Year
frontrunner, senior Chiney Ogwu
mike. Ogwumike continued her ex
cellence with 32 points and 11 re
bounds, marking her 21st double
double of the season. The Huskies'
zone defense had no answer for Og
wumike early on this time around,
as she raced to 21 points in the first
half. Although the Huskies had
been able to limit Ogwumike last
time around, Stanford's guards
were able to feed her the ball in the

often this week, leading to
success.

However, Ogwumike was
not the only player to rise to
the occasion for Stanford.
The Cardinal got out to a
quick start on Sunday as it
hit three of its first four 3-
point attempts to open the
game up with a 13-2 lead.
Two of the early long-range
bombs belonged to junior
sharpshooter Bonnie
Samuelson. She was able to
hit two more during the
game, adding 14 total points
to the Card's effort. In a good
sign for Stanford's offense,
four players on the team
reached double digits in scor
ing on Thursday night: Og
wumike with 32, Samuelson
with 14, freshman guard Lili
Thompson with 11 and junior
point guard Amber Orrange
with 10.
Senior Mikaela Ruef
grabbed 14 boards to lead the
team in rebounding against
Washington, continuing her
dominance on the boards
over the Huskies this year. In
the last matchup of the two
teams, she pulled down a ca
reer-high 22 rebounds.
In the second half, the
Cardinal opened with anoth
er big 16-4 scoring run and
the game was all but out of
reach for the Huskies after
that point.
While her Thursday per
formance against Washing
ton was impressive, Ogwu
mike outdid herself in Stan
ford's Saturday contest
against the Washington State
Cougars. She started out on
fire, scoring 15 points in the
first 12 minutes of the game,
and finished with a career
high 37 points, saving the
best for last on Senior Night.
On an afternoon during
which the team celebrated its
seniors, the Card came away
with a big victory in what was

possibly the team's last game
at Maples Pavilion this sea
son Stanford will host the
third and fourth rounds of
the NCAA Tournament.
Though Stanford went in
to halftime with a lead of only
eight points after the
Cougars cut the deficit late,
Stanford came out after the
break and asserted itself ear
ly in the half. The Card
opened the second half of
play on a 10-0 run and kept
Washington State out of
striking distance for the rest
of the game.
Orrange had another sol
id performance on Saturday,
scoring 20 points, grabbing
eight rebounds from the
point guard position and
dishing out four assists while
guiding the Cardinal offense.
Samuelson also reached dou
ble figures with 10 points, in
cluding two 3-pointers.
The emergence of consis
tent playing from Orrange,
Thompson and Samuelson is
an extremely positive sign for
Stanford's postseason out
look. Early on in the season,
the question was whether
players other than Ogwu
mike would be able to step up
and score when the team
needed it. Lately, Samuelson
has been hot from beyond the
arc, Orrange has been sailing
a smooth offensive ship for
the Cardinal offense and
Thompson and other fresh
men have been able to pro
vide spark and energy for the
team.
If Stanford can keep up
its defensive intensity and
keep a balanced scoring at
tack, its prospects for the up
coming postseason are
bright. The Cardinal will
travel to Seattle to compete
in the Pac-12 Conference
tournament this upcoming
weekend. After earning a
first-round bye, first-seeded

the NCAA Tournament.
Though Stanford went in
to halftime with a lead of only
eight points after the
Cougars cut the deficit late,
Stanford came out after the
break and asserted itself ear
ly in the half. The Card
opened the second half of
play on a 10-0 run and kept
Washington State out of
striking distance for the rest
of the game.
Orrange had another sol
id performance on Saturday,
scoring 20 points, grabbing
eight rebounds from the
point guard position and
dishing out four assists while
guiding the Cardinal offense.
Samuelson also reached dou
ble figures with 10 points, in
cluding two 3-pointers.
The emergence of consis
tent playing from Orrange,
Thompson and Samuelson is
an extremely positive sign for
Stanford's postseason out
look. Early on in the season,
the question was whether
players other than Ogwu
mike would be able to step up
and score when the team
needed it. Lately, Samuelson
has been hot from beyond the
arc, Orrange has been sailing
a smooth offensive ship for
the Cardinal offense and
Thompson and other fresh
men have been able to pro
vide spark and energy for the
team.
If Stanford can keep up
its defensive intensity and
keep a balanced scoring at
tack, its prospects for the up
coming postseason are
bright. The Cardinal will
travel to Seattle to compete
in the Pac-12 Conference
tournament this upcoming
weekend. After earning a
first-round bye, first-seeded
Stanford will face the winner
of Thursday's Colorado-
UCLA matchup on Friday af
ternoon at noon.

The No. 5 Stanford women's
basketball team (28-2,17-1 Pac-12)
closed its regular season in out
standing fashion over the weekend
by easily handling both of its Pac
-12 foes from the state of Washing
ton at Maples Pavilion. On Thurs
day, Stanford trumped the Wash
ington Huskies (16-12, 9-8) by a
score of 83-60 and continued the
domination with an 84-64 victory of
the Washington State Cougars (15-
15,9-9) on Saturday.

The Cardinal had payback on
its mind in Thursday's contest
against Washington, which had
handed Stanford its only Pac-12
loss of the season on Feb. 9. With
stifling defense, the Stanford
squad held the Huskies to 37 per
cent from the field and made sure
that the Huskies didn't repeat their
impressive offensive performance
from last month.

On the offensive side of the ball,
Stanford was led by its All-Ameri
can and National Player of the Year
frontrunner, senior Chiney Ogwu
mike. Ogwumike continued her ex
cellence with 32 points and 11 re
bounds, marking her 21st double
double of the season. The Huskies'
zone defense had no answer for Og
wumike early on this time around,
as she raced to 21 points in the first
half. Although the Huskies had
been able to limit Ogwumike last
time around, Stanford's guards
were able to feed her the ball in the

However, Ogwumike was
not the only player to rise to
the occasion for Stanford.
The Cardinal got out to a
quick start on Sunday as it
hit three of its first four 3-
point attempts to open the
game up with a 13-2 lead.
Two of the early long-range
bombs belonged to junior
sharpshooter Bonnie
Samuelson. She was able to
hit two more during the
game, adding 14 total points
to the Card's effort. In a good
sign for Stanford's offense,
four players on the team
reached double digits in scor
ing on Thursday night: Og
wumike with 32, Samuelson
with 14, freshman guard Lili
Thompson with 11 and junior
point guard Amber Orrange
with 10.
Senior Mikaela Ruef
grabbed 14 boards to lead the
team in rebounding against
Washington, continuing her
dominance on the boards
over the Huskies this year. In
the last matchup of the two
teams, she pulled down a ca
reer-high 22 rebounds.
In the second half, the
Cardinal opened with anoth
er big 16-4 scoring run and
the game was all but out of
reach for the Huskies after
that point.
While her Thursday per
formance against Washing
ton was impressive, Ogwu
mike outdid herself in Stan

Cougars. She started out on

and finished with a career
high 37 points, saving the
best for last on Senior Night.
