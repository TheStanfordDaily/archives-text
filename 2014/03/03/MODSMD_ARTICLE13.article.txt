The No. 5 Stanford women's
basketball team (28-2,17-1 Pac-12)
closed its regular season in out
standing fashion over the weekend
by easily handling both of its Pac
-12 foes from the state of Washing
ton at Maples Pavilion. On Thurs
day, Stanford trumped the Wash
ington Huskies (16-12, 9-8) by a
score of 83-60 and continued the
domination with an 84-64 victory of
the Washington State Cougars (15-
15,9-9) on Saturday.

The Cardinal had payback on
its mind in Thursday's contest
against Washington, which had
handed Stanford its only Pac-12
loss of the season on Feb. 9. With
stifling defense, the Stanford
squad held the Huskies to 37 per
cent from the field and made sure
that the Huskies didn't repeat their
impressive offensive performance
from last month.

On the offensive side of the ball,
Stanford was led by its All-Ameri
can and National Player of the Year
frontrunner, senior Chiney Ogwu
mike. Ogwumike continued her ex
cellence with 32 points and 11 re
bounds, marking her 21st double
double of the season. The Huskies'
zone defense had no answer for Og
wumike early on this time around,
as she raced to 21 points in the first
half. Although the Huskies had
been able to limit Ogwumike last
time around, Stanford's guards
were able to feed her the ball in the
