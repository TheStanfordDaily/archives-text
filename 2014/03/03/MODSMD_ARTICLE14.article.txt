## FROM THE OPINIONS DESK The 						Rest is Silence: American Diplomacy on the Brink 
### Winston Shi 
Pundits predicting America's
decline should rarely be be
lieved, but today they seem
more confident than ever. As I
write, the lead headline on Politico
is "Why Russia no longer fears the
West." CNN talks about Ukraine on
the "brink of disaster;" a sub-head
line points to Senator Lindsey Gra
ham calling Obama "weak" and "in
decisive." News headlines are al
most always overstatements, and
yet there's some truth to what we're
seeing.
Consider this fact for a second:
With the Ukrainian government
having been overthrown, Presi
dent Obama declared on Feb. 28
that Russia should not intervene
militarily in Ukraine. A day later,
Russia sent troops into the
Crimean Peninsula.
For the sake of brevity, I will
pass over the fact that this interven
tion was wholly illegal Ukraine
had been left with nuclear weapons
after the breakup of the Soviet
Union, and in 1994 the Budapest
Memorandum declared that in ex
change for Ukraine's weapons of
mass destruction, Russia would
guarantee Ukraine's territorial sov
ereignty. The Memorandum aside, I
think most readers will agree that
Russia is violating a number of com
monly held diplomatic and moral
principles. Even supporters of Rus
sia should probably agree on this,
although I imagine many of them
believe that the ends justify the
means.
I cannot do fair justice to the cul
tural underpinnings of the Crimean
crisis. The Crimea has traditionally
been part of Russia and was only
transferred to Ukraine in 1954. Al
though Crimea is somewhat au
tonomous within Ukraine, it is still
part of Ukraine.
With this military incursion, the
true colors of Russian intervention
ism have been revealed. To be hon
est, they had been revealed a long
time ago. Russia intervened in the
conflict, even though it has consis
tently protested and opposed
American interventionism at nearly
every opportunity. Now it has vio
lated the territory of a sovereign
nation. Especially in the wake of
Syria and, previously, the invasion
of Georgia, that was to be expected.
(China is the other self-proclaimed
defender of state sovereignty and
nonintervention, but to China's
credit, it hasn't attacked another
country for a generation.)
President Obama was elected on
a swell of anti-interventionist senti
ment, stayed out of the Arab Spring
for the most part and backed down
from intervening in Syria because
Americans did not have the stomach
for it. Perhaps we still don't: A
friend of mine recently described
our generation as the post-Iraq gen
eration in the same way as the post-
Vietnam generation, a people wary
of war and more realistic about our
ability to project power abroad. And
how is that new? In his devastating
excoriation of Obama's foreign poli
cy, Niall Ferguson reminds us that
"In [Obama's] ignominious call to in
action on Syria in September, he ex
plicitly said it: America is not the
world's policeman.'"
Put simply, we don't seem to
have the political will to enforce
peace halfway around the world. I
won't make judgments on whether
that is true or not, but it's a state
ment that President Obama feels
very constrained by. And his limita
tions are routinely outstripped by
his rhetoric.
Cast issues of party loyalty aside
for the moment: Interventionism is
n't necessarily liberal or conserva
tive, idealistic or realistic. Madeline
Albright, Clinton's Secretary of
State, famously asked Colin Powell,
"What's the point of having this su
perb military you're always talking
about if we can't use it?" Mean
while, interventionist GOP war
hawks led the country into Iraq and
Afghanistan. Conversely, there are
left-wingers who try to avoid war
whenever possible and right
wingers who just want America to
be left alone.
What we do about Ukraine,
then, doesn't just involve a political
debate about interventionism or
policy. This is ultimately a question
of American legitimacy.

I don't believe that the current
situation in Ukraine in and of itself
is worth committing American
troops to, and while I believed be
fore the fact that Russia might send
in its troops, I also can't seriously
imagine America —or any other
member of the new Western bloc
doing the same. All things consid

ered, President Obama cannot bear
all the criticism if he is being ham
strung by his electorate; he has a
duty to influence that electorate,
but some battles you just can't win.
It was not President Roosevelt but
Pearl Harbor that brought America
into World War 11.
We can't win a war without the
domestic will to do so. But if that's
the case, we cannot embrace both
the rhetoric of interventionism and
the diplomacy of passivity. The
President of the United States
cannot continue drawing red
lines that he then refuses to en
force.
Former Obama State Depart
ment advisers such as Vali Nasr
(currently head of Johns Hopkins'
school of international relations)
have sharply criticized President
Obama's approach to foreign policy,
pointing out that the President has
subordinated our diplomacy to do
mestic policy considerations. Presi
dent Obama drew a red line over
chemical weapons in Syria and,
faced with Congressional pressure,
backed down. Now his express com
mand in Ukraine has been blatantly
ignored. We should not be sur
prised.
As a nation, our malleability is
politically palatable, but it is also
terrifying. What has rarely been ad
dressed throughout this entire cri
sis is that we guaranteed
Ukraine's borders at Budapest
as well. Even today, that agree
ment is barely on our radar. What
happens, then, if Russia tries to test
our will elsewhere? We gave our
word to Ukraine and so far we have
done nothing: What happens if Rus
sia attacks NATO, which we are al
so bound by treaty to defend? Will
Americans consider the Baltic
States worth American lives?
The most powerful military al
liance on earth the agreement
that defines the Western world
exists only because its signatories
believe that with a stroke of the pen
America agreed to defend them.
With one treaty already broken and
President Obama reeling diplomati
cally the countries on NATO's fron
tier have to start seriously thinking
about whether America will defend
them. Expanding Russian power in
the Caucasus ironically rallied sup
port for NATO defense systems in
Poland and the Czech Republic.
(The United States eventually
backed down on that as well.) Per
haps this conflict will do the same.
As a nation, we have a collective
responsibility to uphold. Unpalat
able as it sounds, President Obama
has made it clear that he won't de
fend that responsibility unless we
will.
Criticizing British Prime Minis
ter David Cameron, The Econo
mist commented, "Yet there is an
other, more important reason why
Mr. Cameron is not suffering the
pain his bungling deserves. It is
that prime ministerial authority has
been diminished... Having down
graded their estimation of his office
as a result, voters do not seem to
judge Mr. Cameron too harshly
when he loses. That is a sign of
weakness, not strength."
Here in the United States the
leader of the free world there
was a huge controversy when Pres
ident Obama backed down over
Syria. Now there is only silence.

ism have been revealed. To be hon
est, they had been revealed a long
time ago. Russia intervened in the
conflict, even though it has consis
tently protested and opposed
American interventionism at nearly
every opportunity. Now it has vio
lated the territory of a sovereign
nation. Especially in the wake of
Syria and, previously, the invasion
of Georgia, that was to be expected.
(China is the other self-proclaimed
defender of state sovereignty and
nonintervention, but to China's
credit, it hasn't attacked another
country for a generation.)
President Obama was elected on
a swell of anti-interventionist senti
ment, stayed out of the Arab Spring
for the most part and backed down
from intervening in Syria because
Americans did not have the stomach
for it. Perhaps we still don't: A
friend of mine recently described
our generation as the post-Iraq gen
eration in the same way as the post-
Vietnam generation, a people wary
of war and more realistic about our
ability to project power abroad. And
how is that new? In his devastating
excoriation of Obama's foreign poli
cy, Niall Ferguson reminds us that
"In [Obama's] ignominious call to in
action on Syria in September, he ex
plicitly said it: America is not the
world's policeman.'"
Put simply, we don't seem to
have the political will to enforce
peace halfway around the world. I
won't make judgments on whether
that is true or not, but it's a state
ment that President Obama feels
very constrained by. And his limita
tions are routinely outstripped by
his rhetoric.
Cast issues of party loyalty aside
for the moment: Interventionism is
n't necessarily liberal or conserva
tive, idealistic or realistic. Madeline
Albright, Clinton's Secretary of
State, famously asked Colin Powell,
"What's the point of having this su
perb military you're always talking
about if we can't use it?" Mean
while, interventionist GOP war
hawks led the country into Iraq and
Afghanistan. Conversely, there are
left-wingers who try to avoid war
whenever possible and right
wingers who just want America to
be left alone.
What we do about Ukraine,
then, doesn't just involve a political
debate about interventionism or
policy. This is ultimately a question
of American legitimacy.

I don't believe that the current
situation in Ukraine in and of itself
is worth committing American
troops to, and while I believed be
fore the fact that Russia might send
in its troops, I also can't seriously
imagine America —or any other
member of the new Western bloc
doing the same. All things consid

ered, President Obama cannot bear
all the criticism if he is being ham
strung by his electorate; he has a
duty to influence that electorate,
but some battles you just can't win.
It was not President Roosevelt but
Pearl Harbor that brought America
into World War 11.
We can't win a war without the
domestic will to do so. But if that's
the case, we cannot embrace both
the rhetoric of interventionism and
the diplomacy of passivity. The
President of the United States
cannot continue drawing red
lines that he then refuses to en
force.
Former Obama State Depart
ment advisers such as Vali Nasr
(currently head of Johns Hopkins'
school of international relations)
have sharply criticized President
Obama's approach to foreign policy,
pointing out that the President has
subordinated our diplomacy to do
mestic policy considerations. Presi
dent Obama drew a red line over
chemical weapons in Syria and,
faced with Congressional pressure,
backed down. Now his express com
mand in Ukraine has been blatantly
ignored. We should not be sur
prised.
As a nation, our malleability is
politically palatable, but it is also
terrifying. What has rarely been ad
dressed throughout this entire cri
sis is that we guaranteed
Ukraine's borders at Budapest
as well. Even today, that agree
ment is barely on our radar. What
happens, then, if Russia tries to test
our will elsewhere? We gave our
word to Ukraine and so far we have
done nothing: What happens if Rus
sia attacks NATO, which we are al
so bound by treaty to defend? Will
Americans consider the Baltic
States worth American lives?
The most powerful military al
liance on earth the agreement
that defines the Western world
exists only because its signatories
believe that with a stroke of the pen
America agreed to defend them.
With one treaty already broken and
President Obama reeling diplomati
cally the countries on NATO's fron
tier have to start seriously thinking
about whether America will defend
them. Expanding Russian power in
the Caucasus ironically rallied sup
port for NATO defense systems in
Poland and the Czech Republic.
(The United States eventually
backed down on that as well.) Per
haps this conflict will do the same.
As a nation, we have a collective
responsibility to uphold. Unpalat
able as it sounds, President Obama
has made it clear that he won't de
fend that responsibility unless we
will.

other, more important reason why
Mr. Cameron is not suffering the

as a result, voters do not seem to
judge Mr. Cameron too harshly
when he loses. That is a sign of
weakness, not strength."

Pundits predicting America's
decline should rarely be be
lieved, but today they seem
more confident than ever. As I
write, the lead headline on Politico
is "Why Russia no longer fears the
West." CNN talks about Ukraine on
the "brink of disaster;" a sub-head
line points to Senator Lindsey Gra
ham calling Obama "weak" and "in
decisive." News headlines are al
most always overstatements, and
yet there's some truth to what we're

Consider this fact for a second:
With the Ukrainian government
having been overthrown, Presi
dent Obama declared on Feb. 28
that Russia should not intervene
militarily in Ukraine. A day later,
Russia sent troops into the
Crimean Peninsula.
For the sake of brevity, I will
pass over the fact that this interven
tion was wholly illegal Ukraine
had been left with nuclear weapons
after the breakup of the Soviet
Union, and in 1994 the Budapest
Memorandum declared that in ex
change for Ukraine's weapons of
mass destruction, Russia would
guarantee Ukraine's territorial sov
ereignty. The Memorandum aside, I
think most readers will agree that
Russia is violating a number of com
monly held diplomatic and moral
principles. Even supporters of Rus
sia should probably agree on this,
although I imagine many of them
believe that the ends justify the
means.
I cannot do fair justice to the cul
tural underpinnings of the Crimean
crisis. The Crimea has traditionally
been part of Russia and was only
transferred to Ukraine in 1954. Al
though Crimea is somewhat au
tonomous within Ukraine, it is still
part of Ukraine.
