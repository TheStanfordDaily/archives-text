# In Praise of Grilled Cheese
## 
### Vihan Lakshman 
It's no secret that the Stanford
Duck Syndrome is alive and well.
Students maintain a carefree
and relaxed appearance while furi
ously paddling beneath the surface
to stay afloat, often to their detri
ment. Many different residential and
health initiatives have tried to ad
dress this issue over the years, but
the question still persists: How can
we combat this Duck Syndrome and
build a stronger, more open commu
nity on campus?

I think the answer has something
to do with grilled cheese sandwiches.
As highlighted in the Daily article
"Google employee delivers free
grilled cheese to dorms" from about
three weeks ago, Michael Rennaker
and his GC Grillaz operation have re
ally stalled something. By bringing
warm, cheesy goodness to select
dorms on campus every Thursday
evening free of charge and all in
the name of "spreading love and
happiness" Rennaker has
achieved some uplifting results.
Many stressed-out students have
noted their appreciation for Ren
naker's acts of good will, and sand
wiches have, in some cases, helped
build stronger dorm communities by
bringing students together.
And this is precisely how grilled
cheese sandwiches and, more gener
ally, the effort to reach out can be a
part of combating the sense of isola
tion among students. Duck Syn
drome thrives off of an isolated view
point where people feel that all eyes
are on them. Constantly on center
stage, they must act accordingly to
uphold the perceived image of what
a Stanford student should look like.
At times, I've been as guilty of this as
anyone.
That's why I think that the best
way to combat Duck Syndrome
the best way to fight that sense of
alienation and tear down any false
perceptions is to celebrate acts of
selflessness and generosity that seek
to build tighter communities and lift
people who are struggling.
But it's not enough just to cele
brate these charitable efforts. To
slay the beast (if a duck can be con
sidered a beast), we must act our
selves.

In an Oct. 19 article in the New
York Times, Kate Murphy discusses
the recent national sensation of
"paying it forward," where cus
tomers at drive-thrus pay for the
meal of the patrons behind them. In

many cases, the chain of good will
continues as recipients go on and pay
it forward themselves.
Charity is ultimately a communal
act, a recognition that we are all in
this together and that everybody has
their neighbor's back. In the midst of
ongoing economic troubles, Murphy
notes that the act of not just initiat
ing an act of kindness, but seeing
that generosity propagate, can lift
the spirits of entire communities.
This willingness to reach out
not to simply feel gracious and bond
over grilled cheese, but to share this
positive energy with others is
what we need to right this pressure
to bury feelings of stress in the
hopes of "fitting in." By reaching out
and creating a strong community,
maybe Stanford can become a place
where students support each other
even more.
I agree that it won't be easy. For
all my lofty talk, I found it really dif
ficult to motivate myself to sit down
and write a handful of thank-you
notes for friends and family mem
bers that I should have reached out
to long ago. But in the process of try
ing, we may create a genuine envi
ronment where students do not feel
the need to operate under false pre
tenses and can really lean on each
other in difficult times. Most of the
learning in college happens outside
the classroom, and we can do so
much more to engage and learn from

one another. Above all, we need a
place where asking for help becomes
the norm.
"All the world's a stage, / And all
the men and women merely play
ers," Shakespeare famously wrote.
On the stage that is Stanford Uni
versity, as well as in the broader
world, we need to do our part to
make sure that no one feels alienat
ed and out of place. While not every
one desires to be a part of a larger
community, we should still share our
love and remember that no one is the
star of the play. There are too many
great people for that to happen. We
can and should all relax and get
along.
Our script is constantly being
rewritten, and we can all do our part
from grilled cheese sandwiches
and beyond —to remember those
moments where we are touched and
seek to spread the kindness to some
one else. Such a change in culture
won't be easy, but it is the process
that will make the difference.
To paraphrase the Stanford foot
ball program, we must take the
ducks into deep water, and the first
step just might be a soul-warming
grilled cheese.

This willingness to reach out

the need to operate under false pre

much more to engage and learn from

one another. Above all, we need a
place where asking for help becomes
the norm.

On the stage that is Stanford Uni

love and remember that no one is the

can and should all relax and get

that will make the difference.

It's no secret that the Stanford
Duck Syndrome is alive and well.
Students maintain a carefree
and relaxed appearance while furi
ously paddling beneath the surface
to stay afloat, often to their detri
ment. Many different residential and
health initiatives have tried to ad
dress this issue over the years, but
the question still persists: How can
we combat this Duck Syndrome and
build a stronger, more open commu
nity on campus?

I think the answer has something
to do with grilled cheese sandwiches.
As highlighted in the Daily article
"Google employee delivers free
grilled cheese to dorms" from about
three weeks ago, Michael Rennaker
and his GC Grillaz operation have re
ally stalled something. By bringing
warm, cheesy goodness to select
dorms on campus every Thursday
evening free of charge and all in
the name of "spreading love and
happiness" Rennaker has
achieved some uplifting results.
Many stressed-out students have
noted their appreciation for Ren
naker's acts of good will, and sand
wiches have, in some cases, helped
build stronger dorm communities by
bringing students together.
And this is precisely how grilled
cheese sandwiches and, more gener
ally, the effort to reach out can be a
part of combating the sense of isola
tion among students. Duck Syn
drome thrives off of an isolated view
point where people feel that all eyes
are on them. Constantly on center
stage, they must act accordingly to
uphold the perceived image of what
a Stanford student should look like.
At times, I've been as guilty of this as
anyone.
That's why I think that the best
way to combat Duck Syndrome
the best way to fight that sense of
alienation and tear down any false
perceptions is to celebrate acts of
selflessness and generosity that seek
to build tighter communities and lift
people who are struggling.
But it's not enough just to cele
brate these charitable efforts. To
slay the beast (if a duck can be con
sidered a beast), we must act our
selves.

In an Oct. 19 article in the New
York Times, Kate Murphy discusses
the recent national sensation of
"paying it forward," where cus
tomers at drive-thrus pay for the
meal of the patrons behind them. In

many cases, the chain of good will
continues as recipients go on and pay
it forward themselves.
Charity is ultimately a communal
act, a recognition that we are all in
this together and that everybody has
their neighbor's back. In the midst of
ongoing economic troubles, Murphy
notes that the act of not just initiat
ing an act of kindness, but seeing
that generosity propagate, can lift
the spirits of entire communities.
