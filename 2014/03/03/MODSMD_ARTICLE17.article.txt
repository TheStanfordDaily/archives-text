# WEEKEND SPLIT FOR CARD
## 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 8 Stanford men's volleyball
team took to the road this past weekend,
returning home with a 1-1 record for the
trip after facing No. 5 Long Beach State
on Friday and Cal State Northridge on
Saturday. The Cardinal lost in four sets to
Long Beach State but managed to rally
and come back to beat Cal State North
ridge in three straight sets. Stanford is
now 10-7 overall and 7-7 in the MPSF.

Stanford, playing its first road game
in two weeks, looked to upset Long
Beach State and improve its standing in
the MPSF. The Cardinal started off very
strong, winning the first set 27-25, but
Long Beach State gained momentum
and took the next three sets, winning the
match 25-27, 25-23, 25-18, 25-23. While

Stanford looked to carry its first-set mo
mentum into the next set, the 49ers
found their rhythm and used their home
court advantage to go on an 8-1 run early
in the second set. Overall, the match was
very close the whole time and both teams
battled back and forth for the lead. In the
fourth and final set, neither team led by
more than two points until Long Beach
State pulled ahead in the final four points
of the match.
Stanford's offense was led by senior
outside hitter Brian Cook, who recorded
21 kills and 13 digs. However, Stanford
struggled with errors and recorded 26
hitting errors. The Cardinal also strug
gled from the service line, with 17 missed
serves. Long Beach State was able to
capitalize off these errors and use Stan
ford errors as momentum throughout
the match. Long Beach State senior Tay
lor Crabb had an impressive 22 kills for
the match and, more impressively, no er
rors on 58 swings. He hit a .379 for the
match, playing a key role in the 49ers' of
fense.
But on Saturday, Stanford was able to
recover from the previous night's very
close and tough loss, sweeping Cal State
Northridge 25-20, 25-17, 25-22 in a con
sistent and well-played match. Stanford
had one of its most impressive offensive
performances of the season, hitting a sea
son-high .456 with 50 kills. Once again,
Cook led the Cardinal with 18 kills, hit
ting .696 for the night. In addition, senior
Eric Mochalski and senior Steven Irvin
both had 11 kills for the match.
"I thought Brian Cook did a nice job
for us this weekend," head coach John
Kosty told GoStanford.com. "He had an
other great match, and has been an excel
lent leader in helping us be successful."
Stanford also lifted itself to a victory
with the help of its defense. Cal State
Northridge was held to a .197 attack per
centage for the night and had only 27
kills as a team. Stanford played aggres
sively from the beginning and won the
first points of each set. With Stanford's
aggressive offense and dominating de
fense, the Matadors were not able to ever
catch up, only tying the match once.
Stanford will remain on the road next
week as it travels to southern California.
It will play No. 4 Pepperdine on Friday
and then No. 7 USC on Sunday as it will
aim to return home with a winning
record in the MPSF before its final home
stretch of the season.
