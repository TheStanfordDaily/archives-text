# Q&A ANDREW ROSS SORKIN
## COLUMNIST AT THE NEW YORK TIMES 
### MARSHALL WATKINS EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
Andrew Ross Sorkin is a financial columnist at
The New York Times and the author of the best
selling book "Too Big to Fail." The Daily sat down
with Sorkin to discuss his background, the chal
lenges of covering Wall Street and what we can ex
pect from the financial sector in the years to come.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): You started at The
New York Times when you were 18. What drove
your initial interest in journalism, and how has
the nature of the work and the appeal of it
changed over time?
Andrew Ross Sorkin (AS): When I started, I
was fascinated by media the world of media. I
was actually very interested in advertising... It
was really only once I got in the newsroom that I
fell in love with storytelling and the adventure
every day of learning a new thing and meeting a
new person and getting people to say things they
weren't supposed to say.
Has it evolved? I never thought I would have all
the opportunities I've had over the past [l5 years]
... So much has changed. Everything has changed.
When I first started, they were just implementing
email. Even a couple of years ago, the coin of the
realm was still to get a big scoop that was going to
run on the front page of the paper the next morn
ing so that when you went to the newsstand it was
on the cover of the New York Times, but when you
looked over at the Journal or the FT... they had
nothing. Now, you post your scoop at 4:31 and the
competitor has it at 4:34 and the other guy has it at
4:38. Context matters a lot more, analysis matters
a lot more than it used to.
TSD: As a financial journalist, how have you
found the challenge of reporting on a close-knit
community like Wall Street? At this point,
would you consider yourself an insider?
AS: It's funny. By default, as a journalist, I'm
clearly an outsider to this world. Over the years,
I've covered it for a long time... but in the book,
part of the challenge was trying to get inside, try
ing to get the reader inside the room so he could
see what's being said.
It's much harder than it used to be... When I
started, there wasn't this industrial complex
around protecting all these people from the press.
It used to be you could call somebody up and un
derstand what's happening, get a little of the inside
scoop or toy and get some context for what's hap
pening ... Now, there's an army of lawyers, there's
an army of PR people, there's a battalion of people
whose entire job is to keep you as far away from
the building as humanly possible. That has made, I
would argue, reporting much more challenging in
terms of really providing the sort of deep reporting
and analysis... and it's only gotten worse post-fi
nancial crisis.
TSD: "Too Big to Fail" was published in 2009.
Looking back on the crisis, have the additional
years of hindsight changed anything?
AS: Not that much. I like to think it's actually
stood up. When you go back and look at what's in
the book, and given all of the materials that have
since been published... I don't think there was
something out there that really shifted the narra
tive from the central reporting line of the book.
Happily —one of the things you worry about is
that one day something would, but I tried to ap
proach it as honestly as I could the first time
around and I think we got pretty close to what hap
pened.
My hope still is that history and historians
needed a reference point as to what happened. Fol
lowing anything, it's very easy to have your views
about what should and shouldn't have happened
and what options people should and shouldn't have
taken, but I think the most important thing is ap
preciating what the actual options on the table are
... We won't know whether all of these decisions
that were made were right or wrong probably for
10,20,30 years. We have to see what happens to the


David A. Grogan/Wikimedia Commons
banks, we have to see what
happens to the economy... we
saved GM, but if GM has a
problem five or 10 years from
now you'd say it was a mistake
to save it the first time.
TSD: Have bankers and reg
ulators internalized the les
sons of the 2008 crisis?
AS: I have a very mixed an
swer. There are certain indi
viduals who appreciate what
took place during the crisis and
have internalized it. Some of
those that did internalize it are
no longer there any more, so
that worries me. I'm anxious
that there's a new generation
of people that are stepping on
to Wall Street that don't have
the perspective and context
[as] to what took place.
The system can't be risk
less either...We all want to
eradicate "too big to fail" and
eradicate the idea that there
could ever be a boom and a
bust. Invariably life is such, for
better or worse, that our goals
should be to mitigate the
booms and busts. But the idea
that the Holy Grail is ensuring
that this never happens may
be sort of a myth. I hope it is
n't, but I'm anxious it would be.

TSD: Wall Street has histori
cally been a major draw for
graduates of universities like
Stanford. Is it still the place
for the best and the bright
est?

AS: The question is
whether the best and the

brightest go there now. You
could argue that the best and
the brightest right now are
trying to find their way here,
to Silicon Valley. I wouldn't dis
suade someone from going to
work on Wall Street. The ques
tion is what is their motivation
for going to work on Wall
Street? My hope is that the
people who go to work in Sili
con Valley go because they love
engineering and they love to
create greater consumer expe
riences and all that, and I
would hope that the people
who are going to Wall Street
are doing it because they have
a passion for finance and be
cause they want to find ways to
power the economy.

The financial incentives
that come with both going to
the Valley and going to Wall
Street, I would hope would be
secondary. If you have a true
passion for it, that's a great
thing. Obviously the money is a
draw for everybody so it's sort
of a matter of why you're going.

TSD: Much of the political
dialogue in recent years
from Occupy Wall Street to
the Tea Party seems to be
based on a flawed under
standing of how the finan
cial system actually works.
Do we collectively need
greater awareness?
AS: The good news is that
there's probably greater finan
cial literacy today than there
ever was, partially as a result
of the crisis I guess you
could call that a backwards sil
ver lining. But there's so much
more work to be done. I don't
think that most people under
stand how it works, why it
works, what all these decisions

actually mean. One of my
great worries is that the crisis
has divided the country more
than ever. Tim Geithner was
just quoted he had a great
line saying, "we saved the
economy, but we lost the coun
try." To some degree, he's
probably right. The economy
didn't collapse completely, but
in the process we created a re
al schism about us as Ameri
cans and equality and inequal
ity and how we should be deal
ing with it.

TSD: Let's turn to the next
crisis. What form is it going
to take, and when might it
happen?
AS: If I knew, I wouldn't be
a journalist...There's a big
question mark about the com
modities market. There are a
number of big, private compa
nies and we have no idea
what's going on. The great
challenge of calling the next
crisis is that you can say
there'll be a crisis but you'll
never know [exactly] what it'll
actually be.
I worry that we as a coun
try and other countries es
pecially countries in some
parts of Europe could really
be overleveraged. The thing I
think we all really learned [in
2008] is that crisis doesn't hap
pen in years and months. It
happens in hours and minutes
and seconds. All that has to
happen is that we're no longer
good for the money and every
thing changes.

est?

AS: The question is
whether the best and the

brightest go there now. You
could argue that the best and
the brightest right now are
trying to find their way here,
to Silicon Valley. I wouldn't dis
suade someone from going to
work on Wall Street. The ques
tion is what is their motivation
for going to work on Wall
Street? My hope is that the
people who go to work in Sili
con Valley go because they love
engineering and they love to
create greater consumer expe
riences and all that, and I
would hope that the people
who are going to Wall Street
are doing it because they have
a passion for finance and be
cause they want to find ways to
power the economy.

The financial incentives
that come with both going to
the Valley and going to Wall
Street, I would hope would be
secondary. If you have a true
passion for it, that's a great
thing. Obviously the money is a
draw for everybody so it's sort
of a matter of why you're going.

TSD: Much of the political
dialogue in recent years
from Occupy Wall Street to
the Tea Party seems to be
based on a flawed under
standing of how the finan
cial system actually works.
Do we collectively need
greater awareness?
AS: The good news is that
there's probably greater finan
cial literacy today than there
ever was, partially as a result
of the crisis I guess you
could call that a backwards sil
ver lining. But there's so much
more work to be done. I don't
think that most people under
stand how it works, why it
works, what all these decisions

actually mean. One of my
great worries is that the crisis
has divided the country more
than ever. Tim Geithner was
just quoted he had a great
line saying, "we saved the
economy, but we lost the coun
try." To some degree, he's
probably right. The economy
didn't collapse completely, but
in the process we created a re
al schism about us as Ameri
cans and equality and inequal
ity and how we should be deal
ing with it.

TSD: Let's turn to the next
crisis. What form is it going
to take, and when might it
happen?
AS: If I knew, I wouldn't be
a journalist...There's a big
question mark about the com
modities market. There are a
number of big, private compa
nies and we have no idea
what's going on. The great
challenge of calling the next
crisis is that you can say
there'll be a crisis but you'll
never know [exactly] what it'll
actually be.
I worry that we as a coun
try and other countries es
pecially countries in some
parts of Europe could really
be overleveraged. The thing I
think we all really learned [in
2008] is that crisis doesn't hap
pen in years and months. It
happens in hours and minutes
and seconds. All that has to
happen is that we're no longer
good for the money and every
thing changes.

Andrew Ross Sorkin is a financial columnist at
The New York Times and the author of the best
selling book "Too Big to Fail." The Daily sat down
with Sorkin to discuss his background, the chal
lenges of covering Wall Street and what we can ex
pect from the financial sector in the years to come.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): You started at The
New York Times when you were 18. What drove
your initial interest in journalism, and how has
the nature of the work and the appeal of it
changed over time?
Andrew Ross Sorkin (AS): When I started, I
was fascinated by media the world of media. I
was actually very interested in advertising... It
was really only once I got in the newsroom that I
fell in love with storytelling and the adventure
every day of learning a new thing and meeting a
new person and getting people to say things they
weren't supposed to say.
Has it evolved? I never thought I would have all
the opportunities I've had over the past [l5 years]
... So much has changed. Everything has changed.
When I first started, they were just implementing
email. Even a couple of years ago, the coin of the
realm was still to get a big scoop that was going to
run on the front page of the paper the next morn
ing so that when you went to the newsstand it was
on the cover of the New York Times, but when you
looked over at the Journal or the FT... they had
nothing. Now, you post your scoop at 4:31 and the
competitor has it at 4:34 and the other guy has it at
4:38. Context matters a lot more, analysis matters
a lot more than it used to.
TSD: As a financial journalist, how have you
found the challenge of reporting on a close-knit
community like Wall Street? At this point,
would you consider yourself an insider?
AS: It's funny. By default, as a journalist, I'm
clearly an outsider to this world. Over the years,
I've covered it for a long time... but in the book,
part of the challenge was trying to get inside, try
ing to get the reader inside the room so he could
see what's being said.
It's much harder than it used to be... When I
started, there wasn't this industrial complex
around protecting all these people from the press.
It used to be you could call somebody up and un
derstand what's happening, get a little of the inside
scoop or toy and get some context for what's hap
pening ... Now, there's an army of lawyers, there's
an army of PR people, there's a battalion of people
whose entire job is to keep you as far away from
the building as humanly possible. That has made, I
would argue, reporting much more challenging in
terms of really providing the sort of deep reporting
and analysis... and it's only gotten worse post-fi
nancial crisis.
TSD: "Too Big to Fail" was published in 2009.
Looking back on the crisis, have the additional
years of hindsight changed anything?
AS: Not that much. I like to think it's actually
stood up. When you go back and look at what's in
the book, and given all of the materials that have
since been published... I don't think there was
something out there that really shifted the narra
tive from the central reporting line of the book.
Happily —one of the things you worry about is
that one day something would, but I tried to ap
proach it as honestly as I could the first time
around and I think we got pretty close to what hap
pened.
My hope still is that history and historians
needed a reference point as to what happened. Fol
lowing anything, it's very easy to have your views
about what should and shouldn't have happened
and what options people should and shouldn't have
taken, but I think the most important thing is ap
preciating what the actual options on the table are
... We won't know whether all of these decisions
that were made were right or wrong probably for
10,20,30 years. We have to see what happens to the


David A. Grogan/Wikimedia Commons
banks, we have to see what
happens to the economy... we
saved GM, but if GM has a
problem five or 10 years from
now you'd say it was a mistake
to save it the first time.
TSD: Have bankers and reg
ulators internalized the les
sons of the 2008 crisis?
AS: I have a very mixed an
swer. There are certain indi
viduals who appreciate what
took place during the crisis and
have internalized it. Some of
those that did internalize it are
no longer there any more, so
that worries me. I'm anxious
that there's a new generation
of people that are stepping on
to Wall Street that don't have
the perspective and context
[as] to what took place.
The system can't be risk
less either...We all want to
eradicate "too big to fail" and
eradicate the idea that there
could ever be a boom and a
bust. Invariably life is such, for
better or worse, that our goals
should be to mitigate the
booms and busts. But the idea
that the Holy Grail is ensuring
that this never happens may
be sort of a myth. I hope it is
n't, but I'm anxious it would be.

TSD: Wall Street has histori
cally been a major draw for
graduates of universities like
Stanford. Is it still the place
for the best and the bright

brightest go there now. You

around protecting all these people from the press.
It used to be you could call somebody up and un
derstand what's happening, get a little of the inside
scoop or toy and get some context for what's hap
pening ... Now, there's an army of lawyers, there's
an army of PR people, there's a battalion of people
whose entire job is to keep you as far away from
the building as humanly possible. That has made, I
would argue, reporting much more challenging in
terms of really providing the sort of deep reporting
and analysis... and it's only gotten worse post-fi
nancial crisis.
TSD: "Too Big to Fail" was published in 2009.
Looking back on the crisis, have the additional
years of hindsight changed anything?
AS: Not that much. I like to think it's actually
stood up. When you go back and look at what's in
the book, and given all of the materials that have
since been published... I don't think there was
something out there that really shifted the narra
tive from the central reporting line of the book.
Happily —one of the things you worry about is
that one day something would, but I tried to ap
proach it as honestly as I could the first time
around and I think we got pretty close to what hap
pened.
My hope still is that history and historians
needed a reference point as to what happened. Fol
lowing anything, it's very easy to have your views
about what should and shouldn't have happened
and what options people should and shouldn't have
taken, but I think the most important thing is ap
preciating what the actual options on the table are
... We won't know whether all of these decisions
that were made were right or wrong probably for
10,20,30 years. We have to see what happens to the

banks, we have to see what
happens to the economy... we
saved GM, but if GM has a
problem five or 10 years from
now you'd say it was a mistake
to save it the first time.
TSD: Have bankers and reg
ulators internalized the les
sons of the 2008 crisis?
AS: I have a very mixed an
swer. There are certain indi
viduals who appreciate what
took place during the crisis and
have internalized it. Some of
those that did internalize it are
no longer there any more, so
that worries me. I'm anxious
that there's a new generation
of people that are stepping on
to Wall Street that don't have
the perspective and context
[as] to what took place.
The system can't be risk
less either...We all want to
eradicate "too big to fail" and
eradicate the idea that there
could ever be a boom and a
bust. Invariably life is such, for
better or worse, that our goals
should be to mitigate the
booms and busts. But the idea
that the Holy Grail is ensuring
that this never happens may
be sort of a myth. I hope it is
n't, but I'm anxious it would be.

TSD: Wall Street has histori
cally been a major draw for
graduates of universities like
Stanford. Is it still the place
for the best and the bright
est?

AS: The question is
whether the best and the

brightest go there now. You
could argue that the best and
the brightest right now are
trying to find their way here,
to Silicon Valley. I wouldn't dis
suade someone from going to
work on Wall Street. The ques
tion is what is their motivation
for going to work on Wall
Street? My hope is that the
people who go to work in Sili
con Valley go because they love
engineering and they love to
create greater consumer expe
riences and all that, and I
would hope that the people
who are going to Wall Street
are doing it because they have
a passion for finance and be
cause they want to find ways to
power the economy.

The financial incentives
that come with both going to
the Valley and going to Wall
Street, I would hope would be
secondary. If you have a true
passion for it, that's a great
thing. Obviously the money is a
draw for everybody so it's sort
of a matter of why you're going.

TSD: Much of the political
dialogue in recent years
from Occupy Wall Street to
the Tea Party seems to be
based on a flawed under
standing of how the finan
cial system actually works.
Do we collectively need
greater awareness?
AS: The good news is that
there's probably greater finan
cial literacy today than there
ever was, partially as a result
of the crisis I guess you
could call that a backwards sil
ver lining. But there's so much
more work to be done. I don't
think that most people under
stand how it works, why it
works, what all these decisions

actually mean. One of my
great worries is that the crisis
has divided the country more
than ever. Tim Geithner was
just quoted he had a great
line saying, "we saved the
economy, but we lost the coun
try." To some degree, he's
probably right. The economy
didn't collapse completely, but
in the process we created a re
al schism about us as Ameri
cans and equality and inequal
ity and how we should be deal
ing with it.

TSD: Let's turn to the next
crisis. What form is it going
to take, and when might it
happen?
AS: If I knew, I wouldn't be
a journalist...There's a big
question mark about the com
modities market. There are a
number of big, private compa
nies and we have no idea
what's going on. The great
challenge of calling the next
crisis is that you can say
there'll be a crisis but you'll
never know [exactly] what it'll
actually be.
I worry that we as a coun
try and other countries es
pecially countries in some
parts of Europe could really
be overleveraged. The thing I
think we all really learned [in
2008] is that crisis doesn't hap
pen in years and months. It
happens in hours and minutes
and seconds. All that has to
happen is that we're no longer
good for the money and every
thing changes.
