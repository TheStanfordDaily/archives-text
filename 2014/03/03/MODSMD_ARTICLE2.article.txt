# Q&A ANDREW ROSS SORKIN
## COLUMNIST AT THE NEW YORK TIMES 
### MARSHALL WATKINS EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
Andrew Ross Sorkin is a financial columnist at
The New York Times and the author of the best
selling book "Too Big to Fail." The Daily sat down
with Sorkin to discuss his background, the chal
lenges of covering Wall Street and what we can ex
pect from the financial sector in the years to come.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): You started at The
New York Times when you were 18. What drove
your initial interest in journalism, and how has
the nature of the work and the appeal of it
changed over time?
Andrew Ross Sorkin (AS): When I started, I
was fascinated by media the world of media. I
was actually very interested in advertising... It
was really only once I got in the newsroom that I
fell in love with storytelling and the adventure
every day of learning a new thing and meeting a
new person and getting people to say things they
weren't supposed to say.
Has it evolved? I never thought I would have all
the opportunities I've had over the past [l5 years]
... So much has changed. Everything has changed.
When I first started, they were just implementing
email. Even a couple of years ago, the coin of the
realm was still to get a big scoop that was going to
run on the front page of the paper the next morn
ing so that when you went to the newsstand it was
on the cover of the New York Times, but when you
looked over at the Journal or the FT... they had
nothing. Now, you post your scoop at 4:31 and the
competitor has it at 4:34 and the other guy has it at
4:38. Context matters a lot more, analysis matters
a lot more than it used to.
TSD: As a financial journalist, how have you
found the challenge of reporting on a close-knit
community like Wall Street? At this point,
would you consider yourself an insider?
AS: It's funny. By default, as a journalist, I'm
clearly an outsider to this world. Over the years,
I've covered it for a long time... but in the book,
part of the challenge was trying to get inside, try
ing to get the reader inside the room so he could
see what's being said.
It's much harder than it used to be... When I
started, there wasn't this industrial complex
around protecting all these people from the press.
It used to be you could call somebody up and un
derstand what's happening, get a little of the inside
scoop or toy and get some context for what's hap
pening ... Now, there's an army of lawyers, there's
an army of PR people, there's a battalion of people
whose entire job is to keep you as far away from
the building as humanly possible. That has made, I
would argue, reporting much more challenging in
terms of really providing the sort of deep reporting
and analysis... and it's only gotten worse post-fi
nancial crisis.
TSD: "Too Big to Fail" was published in 2009.
Looking back on the crisis, have the additional
years of hindsight changed anything?
AS: Not that much. I like to think it's actually
stood up. When you go back and look at what's in
the book, and given all of the materials that have
since been published... I don't think there was
something out there that really shifted the narra
tive from the central reporting line of the book.
Happily â€”one of the things you worry about is
that one day something would, but I tried to ap
proach it as honestly as I could the first time
around and I think we got pretty close to what hap
pened.
My hope still is that history and historians
needed a reference point as to what happened. Fol
lowing anything, it's very easy to have your views
about what should and shouldn't have happened
and what options people should and shouldn't have
taken, but I think the most important thing is ap
preciating what the actual options on the table are
... We won't know whether all of these decisions
that were made were right or wrong probably for
10,20,30 years. We have to see what happens to the
