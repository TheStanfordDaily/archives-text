Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS) recently introduced a Stress-
Less@Stanford initiative in an effort to
complement existing clinical services and

bucher said. "The program will have a di

in this context."

for consultation and liaison Alejandro
Martinez. Martinez noted that a campus

stress consultants, and have launched pilot
