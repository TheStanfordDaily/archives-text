# CAPS addresses stress on campus
## 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS) recently introduced a Stress-
Less@Stanford initiative in an effort to
complement existing clinical services and
better foster mental health on campus.
According to CAPS director Ronald Al
bucher, StressLess@Stanford aims to
build on existing partnerships with campus
organizations by giving students the op
portunity to talk informally with stress

consultants at "satellite" locations around
campus.

"StressLess@Stanford further pro
motes [CAPS's] presence on campus," Al
bucher said. "The program will have a di
rect benefit to students, promote well-be
ing and might even convince some stu
dents, who otherwise would never come to
Vaden, to speak with one of our therapists
in this context."
Development of the StressLess@Stan
ford program began last year. Since then,
administrators have focused on creating

more succinct and relatable materials, ac
cording to CAPS senior associate director
for consultation and liaison Alejandro
Martinez. Martinez noted that a campus
wide survey had shown that more than 60
percent of students expressed interest in
better knowing how to manage stress in
their lives.

Administrators have also worked on de
signing a cohesive training model for
stress consultants, and have launched pilot
programs in the School of Engi
neering and some community cen
ters that are focused on identifying
efficient delivery mechanisms.
According to Lindsay Ellch, a
postdoctoral fellow at CAPS who
helped design the initiative and
who heads the School of Engineer
ing pilot program, StressLesst速
Stanford is shaped around one-on
one, 20-minute appointments with
a stress consultant.
"It's all about having an open
dialogue about what the stressor
currently is, what's been hard,
what's not working any more that
has worked in the past, working
on their strengths that they al
ready bring in and supplementing

those with other resources and
supporting them," Ellch said.
"At Packard, we have been re
flecting on what students in the 20
minutes are really finding valu
able and how to best use and
structure that time," she added,
referencing her pilot program.
Martinez framed Stress-
Less@Stanford as potentially al
lowing students to achieve their
full potential by the removal of pe
ripheral concerns.
"We want to be part of the
process that helps people sustain
themselves and feel more empow
ered to pursue their ambitious
goals in away that is not going to
cost them their health, their rela
tionships and their self-esteem,"
Martinez said. "That's what we're
trying to reduce the risk of."
