## Online course to explore creativity through music 
### SKYLAR COHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Fans of musicians like Josh Groban, Tegan and Sara
and Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda will get a chance to learn
directly from and interact with their idols next quarter
through Creativity: Music to my Ears, a new free online
course offered by the Stanford Technology Ventures Pro
gram (STVP).
The star-studded six-week course, which will use the
online course platform NovoEd, will explore the value of
creativity as expressed through music. Course instructor
Tina Seelig Ph.D.'Bs, STVP's executive director, recalled
an online version of her on-campus course on creativity
meeting with great success and noted that Warner Music
Group had approached Stanford about the possibility of
collaboration with regards to evaluating the future of the
music industry.
"The focus of this course will be on understanding the
opportunities and challenges of the music industry," Seel
ig said. "Students will practice retraining problems, chal
lenging assumptions, connecting and combining ideas and
working on creative teams."
Celebrity content will be presented in pre-recorded in
terviews and live Google Hangouts through which stu
dents and stars can interact in real time. Seelig noted that
the class will feature three individual assignments and
one two-week group assignment.
Although Seelig declined to elaborate on the specific
nature of the assignments, past assignments from non-
music courses challenged
teams to exercise their cre
ative skills by finding the val
ue hidden in a stick of chewing
gum, loaf of bread or handful
of rubber bands.
Stanford affiliates have a
few special reasons to join the
course. According to Seelig,
entering the code "NerdNa
tion2ol4" will allow Stanford
students and alumni to con
nect with other Stanford affil
iates. Additionally, according
to STVP's managing director
Matt Harvey, the program

has worked to set up possible
internship opportunities with
Warner Bros. Records for
Stanford students who partic
ipate in the online course.
NovoEd itself has a strong
Stanford connection. Created
by associate professor of man
agement science and engi
neering (MS&E) Amin Saberi
and MS&E doctoral student
Farnaz Ronaghi 'lO Ph.D. 'l4,
the platform distinguishes it
self from other massive open
online course (MOOC) plat
forms by an emphasis on in
teraction between students
from around the world and on
peer feedback.
From an initial offering
that sought to facilitate a sin
gle online entrepreneurship

course that would remain sim
ilar to an on-campus experi
ence, the platform has since
expanded to partner universi
ties like Princeton. An individ
ual course taught in Spanish
about strategic decision mak
ing even enrolled 120,000 stu
dents at once.

"I think true learning hap
pens only experientially and
in the right social context, so
our goal is to expand the scope
of the courses that we are of
fering- right now we have
partnered with sixteen insti
tutions," Saberi said. "Our
goal is to change the way peo
ple learn online."
