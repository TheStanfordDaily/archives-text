## Stanford offers innovation advice 
### KYLIE JUE DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's National Center for Engineering Path
ways to Innovation (Epicenter) recently selected 12 uni
versities as the inaugural cohort of the center's Path
ways to Innovation program.
Rinded by the National Science Foundation and
managed by the National Collegiate Inventors and In
novators Alliance (NCIIA), Epicenter aims to improve
engineering and computer science education for under
graduates around the nation.
"We specifically developed this program called Path
ways to help faculty at other schools succeed," said Tom
Byers, entrepreneurship professor in the School of En
gineering and Epicenter director.
Through the Pathways program, Stanford will work
with the partner schools to develop local cultures of in
novation and entrepreneurship over the next two years.
According to Byers, students encompassed by the pro
gram make up five percent of undergraduates specializ
ing in computer science and engineering across the na
tion.
"Pathways is a startup itself," Byers said. "We have
12 schools selected to be in the charter group or the ini
tial cohort, and we had them here at Stanford in January
as a preliminary meeting."
