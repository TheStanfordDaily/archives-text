## Stanford offers innovation advice 
### KYLIE JUE DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's National Center for Engineering Path
ways to Innovation (Epicenter) recently selected 12 uni
versities as the inaugural cohort of the center's Path
ways to Innovation program.
Rinded by the National Science Foundation and
managed by the National Collegiate Inventors and In
novators Alliance (NCIIA), Epicenter aims to improve
engineering and computer science education for under
graduates around the nation.
"We specifically developed this program called Path
ways to help faculty at other schools succeed," said Tom
Byers, entrepreneurship professor in the School of En
gineering and Epicenter director.
Through the Pathways program, Stanford will work
with the partner schools to develop local cultures of in
novation and entrepreneurship over the next two years.
According to Byers, students encompassed by the pro
gram make up five percent of undergraduates specializ
ing in computer science and engineering across the na
tion.
"Pathways is a startup itself," Byers said. "We have
12 schools selected to be in the charter group or the ini
tial cohort, and we had them here at Stanford in January
as a preliminary meeting."
Around the nation
At their first meeting in
January, participating
schools were briefed on the
overall process and goals of
the program and encouraged
to identify their own re
sources and objectives. A
second meeting late last
month produced strategic
plans and identified neces
sary steps for implementa
tion.
Yash Risbud, managing
director of the C. Y. Starr Re
search Foundation and
leader of the Pathways to In
novation team at Cooper
Union, emphasized the in
sights offered into Stanford's
engineering environment
and the role played by the
Hasso Plattner Institute of
Design (d.school).
"I've certainly gotten to
meet some fascinating folks
on [Stanford's] campus," Ris
bud said. "I think the key part

of the presentation for us is
that [in the future] we should
strive to really incorporate
these pieces into the formal
part of the undergraduate en
gineering education."
The Pathways program's
inaugural class spans a vari
ety of colleges in terms of lo
cations, sizes and specialties.
Partner institutions' plans
range from improving an ex
isting program to creating
new resources for students.

According to Ilya Avdeev,
assistant professor of me
chanical engineering at the
University of Wisconsin-Mil
waukee (UW-M), UW-M
wants to increase students'
awareness of the resources
available to them. In the long
term, the university hopes to
both create new elective
classes and encourage engi
neering students to look at in
novation-cultivating courses
outside their department.
"Engineering students
don't necessarily have time in
their busy curriculum to take
some business courses or oth
er types of courses that would
help them ventures or their

innovative processes,"
Avdeev said. "We plan to look
at these gaps and see how we
can create space in the pro
grams in engineering so that
students have an opportunity
to take these courses."

Stanford as a model
Both Risbud and Avdeev
emphasized Stanford's role
as a leader in entrepreneur
ship and innovation educa
tion.

"Stanford has been a mod
el for a lot of educational
champs in the country and in
the world, so it's only natural
for Stanford to lead this ef
fort," Avdeev said. "We can
see what motivated people in
Stanford to do things a cer
tain way, and if it's aligned
with our motivation, we can
find a different way of doing
it."

Byers noted the potential
for partner institutions to
learn from each other as well,
with Stanford helping the col
leges to analyze their needs
and areas for growth.
"The short term goal is to
assist that school or college in

developing a strategic plan
a road map for how to im
prove the offerings and op
portunities regarding entre
preneurship and innovation
education," Byers said. "The
long term is that the institu
tion changes and in fact offers
a similar amount [of entre
preneurship opportunities]

that you see at leading
schools."
Next year, according to
Byers, Epicenter hopes to
start a second Pathways co
hort with double the number
of universities.
"This is exciting because
it's hard to effect change at
universities," Byers said.

"We really want eventually
the majority, if not every, col
lege in America to offer the
kinds of opportunities about
entrepreneurship and inno
vation as we've grown accus
tomed to at Stanford."

to take these courses."

Stanford as a model
Both Risbud and Avdeev
emphasized Stanford's role
as a leader in entrepreneur
ship and innovation educa
tion.

"Stanford has been a mod
el for a lot of educational
champs in the country and in
the world, so it's only natural
for Stanford to lead this ef
fort," Avdeev said. "We can
see what motivated people in
Stanford to do things a cer
tain way, and if it's aligned
with our motivation, we can
find a different way of doing
it."

Byers noted the potential
for partner institutions to
learn from each other as well,
with Stanford helping the col
leges to analyze their needs
and areas for growth.
"The short term goal is to
assist that school or college in

developing a strategic plan
a road map for how to im
prove the offerings and op
portunities regarding entre
preneurship and innovation
education," Byers said. "The
long term is that the institu
tion changes and in fact offers
a similar amount [of entre
preneurship opportunities]

that you see at leading
schools."
Next year, according to
Byers, Epicenter hopes to
start a second Pathways co
hort with double the number
of universities.
"This is exciting because
it's hard to effect change at
universities," Byers said.

"We really want eventually
the majority, if not every, col
lege in America to offer the
kinds of opportunities about
entrepreneurship and inno
vation as we've grown accus
tomed to at Stanford."

As part of the Pathways to Innovation program, team leaders from 12 universities met with
Epicenter staff on Jan. 16 to discuss innovation and entrepreneurship on campus.
Stanford's National Center for Engineering Path
ways to Innovation (Epicenter) recently selected 12 uni
versities as the inaugural cohort of the center's Path
ways to Innovation program.
Rinded by the National Science Foundation and
managed by the National Collegiate Inventors and In
novators Alliance (NCIIA), Epicenter aims to improve
engineering and computer science education for under
graduates around the nation.
"We specifically developed this program called Path
ways to help faculty at other schools succeed," said Tom
Byers, entrepreneurship professor in the School of En
gineering and Epicenter director.
Through the Pathways program, Stanford will work
with the partner schools to develop local cultures of in
novation and entrepreneurship over the next two years.
According to Byers, students encompassed by the pro
gram make up five percent of undergraduates specializ
ing in computer science and engineering across the na
tion.
"Pathways is a startup itself," Byers said. "We have
12 schools selected to be in the charter group or the ini
tial cohort, and we had them here at Stanford in January
as a preliminary meeting."
Around the nation
At their first meeting in
January, participating
schools were briefed on the
overall process and goals of
the program and encouraged
to identify their own re
sources and objectives. A
second meeting late last
month produced strategic
plans and identified neces
sary steps for implementa
tion.
Yash Risbud, managing
director of the C. Y. Starr Re
search Foundation and
leader of the Pathways to In
novation team at Cooper
Union, emphasized the in
sights offered into Stanford's
engineering environment
and the role played by the
Hasso Plattner Institute of
Design (d.school).
"I've certainly gotten to
meet some fascinating folks
on [Stanford's] campus," Ris
bud said. "I think the key part

of the presentation for us is
that [in the future] we should
strive to really incorporate
these pieces into the formal
part of the undergraduate en
gineering education."
The Pathways program's
inaugural class spans a vari
ety of colleges in terms of lo
cations, sizes and specialties.
Partner institutions' plans
range from improving an ex
isting program to creating
new resources for students.

According to Ilya Avdeev,
assistant professor of me
chanical engineering at the
University of Wisconsin-Mil
waukee (UW-M), UW-M
wants to increase students'
awareness of the resources
available to them. In the long
term, the university hopes to
both create new elective
classes and encourage engi
neering students to look at in
novation-cultivating courses
outside their department.
"Engineering students
don't necessarily have time in
their busy curriculum to take
some business courses or oth
er types of courses that would
help them ventures or their

innovative processes,"
Avdeev said. "We plan to look
at these gaps and see how we
can create space in the pro
grams in engineering so that
students have an opportunity
to take these courses."
