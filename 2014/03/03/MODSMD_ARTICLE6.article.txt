### EDWARD NGAI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Economies Unseen, the ninth an
nual conference of the Stanford As
sociation for International Develop
ment (SAID), probed the informal
economy a network of informal
and illicit transactions collectively
worth $lO trillion a year in an all
day event on Saturday.

Between 150 and 200 students at
tended the three panels, a develop
ment-focused career fair and a

keynote speech by Robert Neuwirth,
a journalist and author who has writ
ten extensively on urban poverty.
Other speakers included Karl Eiken
berry M.A. '94 Ph.D. 'l4, former am
bassador to Afghanistan, and Steve
Daniels, a research engineer at IBM.
Sarah Johnson 'l6, the conference
chair, said that her executive team
chose the informal economy because
it poses a multifaceted and challeng
ing problem.

The Stanford Association for International Development (SAID) focused on
the informal economy at its ninth annual conference on Saturday.
"The informal economy is
massive. It's everywhere.
It's hard to define," she said.
"It breaks down into two cat
egories: benign informal
trade, which is not harmful
to anyone, and the more ne
farious side, like human traf
ficking and weapons trading.
Policy options do need to dif
fer depending where a par
ticular type of trade falls on
that spectrum."
Compared to previous
conferences, Johnson added
a small workshop compo
nent, dubbed "interactive fo
cus groups," framing them
as an alternative to those
seeking a different confer
ence experience.
"If you didn't want to sit
in on the panels, there was
something you could do in
lieu of leaving the confer
ence," said Fiona Noonan
'l7, director of the interac
tive focus groups. "If you
wanted a more interactive
experience, it might be more
useful than just listening to a
panel of experts."
These groups took the

form of roundtable sessions
hosted by Benetech, a data
and technology-driven non
profit, and the Pacific Links
Foundation, an organization
empowering women for so
cial change.
The longest, most inten
sive workshop was held in
conjunction with the Hasso
Plattner Institute of Design
(d. school) and mobile re
search nonprofit Mobile
Metrix, which collects data
on underserved populations
in Brazil. In a daylong inten
sive, participants worked
with Mobile Metrix's
founder on the organiza
tion's strategy and commu
nications.
Organizers emphasized
that while the groups were
far from perfect in their first
year, they offered a refresh
ing alternative to conven
tional conference program
ming.
"Even though it would
have been cool to have a few
more people in the smaller
setting, it really fostered a
good environment for people
to feel they could ask ques
tions and get questions an
swered," Noonan said. "It
was away to do some prob
lem solving instead of just
learning about what was

happening."
For the second consecu
tive year, the conference in
cluded an afternoon career
fair where potential employ
ers like Kiva and the Foun
dation for Sustainable De
velopment tabled and pre
sented. According to Magali
Duque 'l5, 11 companies at
tended, a decline from last
year's total of 14.
"Given the space that we
had, [ll] was actually a much
better number," she assert
ed, noting that all the organ
izations presenting this year
had internship or fellowship
opportunities open to stu
dents.
Johnson, whose goals for
the conference included
more active event program
ming, said that she was en
couraged by the feedback
she received on the focus
groups and the workshop.
"The main room was def
initely focused on the panels
and that is still a very impor
tant component of the con
ference," she said. "That be
ing said, the future of the
conference lies in incorpo
rating more interactive
events."
