## Cardinal football not so easy to write off 
### Michael Peterson 
There may not be a more
daunting task in sports
than following greatness.
Every legend that has
ever graced a sports field
leaves at some point, either to join an
other team or to call it a career. The
athletes that replace these legends
are charged not only with stepping in
to an important role for quite possibly
their first time but filling the vacant
gap left by a superstar and the expec
tations that come along with it.
Few people grow up imagining
themselves becoming the New York
Yankees' shortstop after Derek
Jeter, the Chicago Bulls' shooting
guard after Michael Jordan or the
Florida Gators' quarterback after
Tim Tebow. With so much prior suc
cess, it's difficult for those who fol
low to do anything but let fans
down.
For Stanford football, the task
of replacing departing fifth-year
seniors Shayne Skov, Trent Mur
phy and Ben Gardner and seniors
Ed Reynolds and David Yankey
looms large. While these players
may or may not have successful
NFL careers, they became Stan
ford legends the leaders of the
first class in Stanford history to go
to four straight bowl games, let
alone four straight BCS bowl
games. No other school in the na
tion can claim the feat of going to
four straight BCS games in the fi
nal four years of the BCS system.
Success became an assumption for
Stanford football thanks to these
guys.
But if there's anyone on Stan
ford's roster who is scared or not
ready to take over and continue the
success these players established,
it's not showing.
It seems that with each new sea
son, there's a "flaw" with the team
that will keep them from succeed
ing. Heisman runner-up Toby Ger
hart 'O9 departed, and with him ap
parently any hopes of sustained
success for the Card went as well.
When Jim Harbaugh left, success
was supposed to leave with him. Af
ter Andrew Luck 'l2 left, few peo
ple expected the Card to remain a
Pac-12 competitor. And now, with
one of the best defenses in the na
tion losing five of its most impor
tant starters and one of the nation's
best offensive lines losing four of
five starters, the Card slipped be
hind Oregon and even UCLA in
projections for next season in the
Pac-12.
Don't write off Stanford just yet.
With spring practices underway,
the first steps in reorganizing the
offensive line and the defense have
begun. The famed 2012 offensive
line recruiting class, which included
two five-star recruits, four four
star recruits and a three-star re
cruit according to Rivals, stands to
take over with sophomores Josh
Garnett, Graham Shuler, Johnny
Caspers and Kyle Murphy leading
the competition to start on the line
along with Andrus Peat, the only
returning starter.
The defense will have to over
come several key losses, but junior
Kevin Anderson and sophomore
Blake Martinez have already
shown their prowess at linebacker
in stepping in for Skov and Murphy.
Sophomore defensive end Luke
Kaumatule possesses incredible
athleticism, standing 6-foot-7 and
weighing 270 pounds with tight end
speed and should play a prominent
role after he develops at the defen
sive end position he transitioned
from tight end midway through last
season. Sophomore Aziz Shittu and
senior Blake Lueders provide re
turning experience at defensive end
and sophomore Jordan Watkins
made great strides last season in
practice according to head coach
David Shaw and figures to factor
into the defensive line rotation.
Yes, the defense will greatly
miss its leaders and the offense los
es a workhorse in senior Tyler
Gaffney, but the Cardinal also has
many bright spots heading into
next season, including a wide re
ceiver corps as deep and talented as
any in the nation and a quarterback
who now has a season and a half of
starting experience. Returners like
senior A.J. Tarpley, junior Jordan
Richards, senior Henry Anderson
and sophomore Alex Carter should
also provide both the exceptional
talent and leadership that the de
fense had last year.
