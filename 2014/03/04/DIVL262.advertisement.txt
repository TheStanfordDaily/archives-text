Stanford Continuing Studies presents
Petroleum Free for One Year:
Practical Sustainability in the Digital Age
Thursday, March 6
7:30 pm
Jordan Hall (Building 420)
Room 040
Stanford University
Free and open to the public
Join us for an encore evening with Doug Fine (Author of Farewell,
My Subaru) as he describes his decade-long adventure living off
the grid on a remote solar-powered ranch in New Mexico. Ten
years ago, Fine says, he rediscovered his "indigenous gene"â€”
the part of every one of us that is still a Paleolithic hunter
gatherer. This had nothing to do with culture he is convinced,
and everything to do with biology and endorphins; waking to
bird-calls rather than to an alarm clock will probably make many
of us happier humans, he suspects.
Fine documents his journey from child of the 1980's suburbs
to successful eschewer of petroleum. Attendees will come
away with two major messages. First, we will learn that
practical sustainability in the Digital Age is not a matter of
Steve Jobs versus the Unabomber. Second, we shouldn't
think that eliminating 80 percent of the fossil fuels in our lives
is a pipe dream best left to the experts.
