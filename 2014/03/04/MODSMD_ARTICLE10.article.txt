# MIXED RESULTS
## Softball goes 3-2 over weekend 
### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For the second straight tourna
ment, the Stanford Softball team
put in a solid performance at the
Under Armour Invitational, but it
is also worth noting that it failed to
capitalize on all of the opportunities
available to it. The N0.15 Cardinal
(17-5) managed to go 3-2 against its

competition in Florida, notching
victories over Central Arkansas,
Georgia State and Kennesaw State,
while falling to host South Florida
and suffering a surprising loss to
Central Connecticut State.
Freshman Maddie Schreyer
continued her dominance in the
circle this weekend, as the Wood
inville, Wash., product yielded only
one earned run in 29 innings of
work. Schreyer began the tourna
ment with a dominant two-hitter
against Central Arkansas (8-14).
Over the course of 6.1 innings,
Schreyer struck out six UCA bat

ters while forcing 10 groundouts to
only two fly outs in a 7-3 victory.

After throwing 97 pitches
against Central Arkansas, Schrey
er still managed to pitch a com
plete game against South Florida
(13-5) in a 3-2 loss to the Bulls in
the second half of the Friday dou
bleheader. While Schreyer was

able to scatter five hits and not
give up an earned run to USF, the
2012 Washington Gatorade Player
of the Year had a costly two-base
error with the Cardinal holding a
slim 1-0 lead in the bottom of the
fifth inning that ultimately kept
the Bulls' rally alive. USF would
score three runs in the frame to
seal its upset of the Cardinal.
In turn, in her last two starts of
the weekend, Schreyer absolutely
stifled Georgia State (11-6) and
Kennesaw State (8-8), striking out
