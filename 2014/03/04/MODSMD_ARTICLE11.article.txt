### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
Senior Maya Dißado led the
charge for Stanford women's swim
ming and diving by collecting three
individual conference titles, while
junior Katie Olsen earned two ti
tles and seniors Felicia Lee and
Stephanie Phipps notched one
apiece at the Pac-12 Championship
Meets over the weekend. Despite
the strong individual performanc
es, however, the Cardinal was ulti
mately surpassed by the rival Cali
fornia Golden Bears as it failed to
defend its 2013 conference champi
onship, accumulating a total of

1,364.0 points to the Bears' 1,552.5.
The Cardinal started the meet
strong with a solid victory in the
200-yard medley relay in a school
record 1:35.74 as the team of Lee,
Olsen, freshman Nicole Stafford
and junior Maddy Schaefer tri
umphed over Cal thanks to a fero

cious breaststroke leg from Olsen
that paced the Cardinal and ulti
mately gave it a large enough cush
ion to emerge victorious.
That was only the beginning of
Olsen's successful performances;
she went on to sweep the breast
stroke events with times of 59.17 in

the 100 and 2:08.39 in the 200, the
latter being the third-fastest time
in Stanford history. In the 100, she
barely out-paced Kasey Carlson of
USC after having been neck-and
neck with the senior through the

Junior Katie Olsen (above) swept the breaststroke events and contributed to a second-place finish for the
Cardinal, the fifth consecutive year it has finished among the top two teams at the Pac- 12 Championships.
first 50 yards. In the 200, she was
even with USC's Stina Gardell for
the first 100 yards before pulling
ahead in the second half as Gardell
grew fatigued and slowed down.
She eventually beat Utah freshman
Stina Colleou by seven-tenths of a
second.

"Today, entering the breast
stroke, I just wanted to go out there,
have fun and feed off of the energy
of my teammates and kind of just go
out and race and I was very happy,"
Olsen said to the Pac-12 Networks.
"I was actually pretty surprised
but pleasant surprise. Stanford has
kind of this fire that we race with,

and we really need to kind of go into
the session with that fire and go out
there and race and have fun."

Dißado, meanwhile, claimed her
individual titles by sweeping the in
dividual medley (IM) events and
swooping to a solid victory in the
200-yard butterfly. In the 200 IM,
Dißado fell behind Gardell and
Celina Li of Cal early before cata
pulting herself to victory with a
powerful freestyle leg. Meanwhile,
her second consecutive victory in
the 400 was all but clinched after
the first 100 yards, as she built a
lead that she never relinquished as
she finished in 4:01.72. Her victory
in the 200 butterfly was largely due
to her ability to sustain her pace
throughout the race, as she took
charge in the second half of the race
with no 50-yard splits exceeding 30
seconds to cruise to an easy victory

in 1:53.60.
"I was excited to defend my title
in the 400 IM," said Dißado to the
Pac-12 Networks. "I might have
gone out a little faster than I nor
mally would. I just wanted to get it
done... I've never won both IMs in
the same meet. I've never won the
200 IM, either. It's nice and hopeful
ly it's a good sign for things to come
at [the NCAA Championships]."
Senior Felicia Lee continued her
stellar season with an individual ti
tle in the 100-yard butterfly while
also setting a new school record of
51.29 in the 100-yard backstroke in
a losing effort to Cal sophomore
Rachel Bootsma. She was also a
participant in the 400-yard medley
relay, in which she, Dißado, Olsen
and freshman Lia Neal set a new
school record with their time of
3:29.65.

Neal also impressed in her first
Pac-12 Championship, notching a
pair of runner-up performances in
the 100-yard and 200-yard freestyle
events behind Cal freshman and
Olympic teammate Missy Franklin.
Phipps won the 1-meter diving
event with her score of 332.25 but
was unable to defend her confer
ence title in the 3-meter event, los
ing by just nine points to USC's Ha
ley Ishimatsu.
Moving forward, the Cardinal
will look to head into the NCAA
Championships in three weeks with
confidence after its impressive
showing at the Pac-12 meet. The
NCAAs will take place in Min
neapolis, Minn, starting on March
20.
