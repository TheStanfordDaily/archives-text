# SPORTS BRIEF
## Stanford gymnastics competes against Cal, Japan, Canada, Finland and Norway 
### â€“ Nitish Kulkarni 
Stanford men's gymnastics, along with
Cal men's gymnastics and the national
teams of Canada, Finland, Japan and Nor
way, competed at Burnham Pavilion in front
of over 1,000 fans on Saturday.
If Stanford University was a country,
Stanford athletes' performances in the 2012
London Olympics would have placed the
University among the top 20 nations in the
medals tally, with 12 gold medals going to
Stanford athletes.
It's no surprise, then, that Stanford's
loss to Japan's collegiate all-star team at
Saturday's meet was so narrow. The Japan
ese team edged past Stanford men's gym
nastics by just under four points to beat
Stanford's score of 443.65. Just as impor
tantly, however, Stanford edged archrival
Cal's 429.20 by more than 14 points.
Freshman Akash Modi had a particular
ly strong performance, earning his fourth
all-around title of the season, reaching the
NCAA top score of the season of 91.35 to
finish .05 ahead of Shohei Fujiwara of
Japan. Modi is the only gymnast in the
NCAA to have scored over 90 points this
season and has now done so twice.
Freshman Taylor Seaton and senior Sean
Senters both placed in the top five in the
vault, coming in third and second, respective
ly, while sophomore Dennis Zaremski fin
ished in second place on the rings. Junior
Brian Knott and senior Chris Turner also
contributed career-best performances on the
high bar and pommel horse, respectively.
Stanford's next home meet will be on
Saturday, March 8, hosting Ohio State, Ari
zona State and Cal.
