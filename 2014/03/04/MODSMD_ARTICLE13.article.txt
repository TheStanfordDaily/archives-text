## SUPER TUESDAY Non-intervention Never Sounded so Good 
### Josh Jones 
Asa 22-year-old college stu
/\ dent, I recognize lam not ex-
XApected to speak on foreign
policy. Yet I write today as both a
Marine Corps brat and a concerned
citizen who has seen his country in
a state of war for the greater part
of his life. I was only nine years old
when terrorists attacked the World
Trade Center, but since that time, I
have heard of nothing but wars and
rumors of wars in the Middle East
and elsewhere.
During the Bush Administra
tion, many spoke out against U.S.
military engagements abroad. But
since President Obama took office
in 2009, anti-war sentiments have
been much more subdued. The du
ration and distant nature of the
wars, combined with Americans'
overall lack of personal connection
to members of the Armed Forces,
have significantly diminished the
average citizen's ability to under
stand the human cost associated
with our presence there.
U.S. and coalition casualties
from Iraq and Afghanistan now to
tal 8,217 people. The Iraq Body
Count project reports that the Iraq
War has caused a massive 121,614
to 134,950 civilian casualties, but
even more staggeringly, a new 2013
study suggests that violence and
wartime conditions have been re
sponsible for over 500,000 civilian
deaths.
Sadly, our government has a
poor track record when it comes to
picking wars and interventions.
Much as the constant threat of ter
rorism breeds fear and encourages
big government today, the fear of
communism justified U.S. lawless
ness and interventionism abroad for
the greater part of the 20th century.
The CIA has now led operations in
countries all around the globe, doing
everything from gathering intelli
gence to training insurgents to fund
ing propaganda efforts.
Through it all, America has
been far from consistent in its
Western ideals, in several cases
opting to oust democratically elect
ed governments. Perhaps the most
famous of these was the overthrow
of Prime Minister Mossadegh of
Iran in 1953.
At other times, U.S. interven
tionism has inadvertently paved
the way for bloody dictators. In
2000, the CIA admitted to being
heavily involved in the ousting of
the democratically-elected Sal
vador Allende of Chile, which led to
the rise of the authoritarian Augus
to Pinochet in 1973. This dictator
would go on to kill over 3,000 of his
own people and torture nearly
30,000 others. During my two
years as a missionary in Chile, I
was able to see just how negatively
some view such involvement in the
affairs of others.
More than once, our interven
tionism has not only fueled anti-
American sentiments but directly
backfired. In the 1980s, the Rea
gan Administration gave weapons
and billions of dollars of aid to
Afghanistan in their fight against
the Soviet Union. During this same
time, the U.S. provided Iraq with
intelligence in their war against
Iran, turning a blind eye to Sad
dam Hussein's use of chemical
weapons, and ironically, the U.S.
was also selling weapons to Iran,
which resulted in the infamous
Iran-Contra Scandal. Years later,
we can fully appreciate the reper
cussions of our meddling in
Afghanistan and Iraq.
While our wars and foreign en
tanglements keep most people
more or less oblivious to the sub
tler realities of the American em
pire, military families such as my
own experience it firsthand. Dur
ing my family's six-year deploy
ment to Okinawa, Japan, we saw
massive protests from those who
didn't want our facilities on their
island. At the time, this broke my
heart I loved the Okinawans
and couldn't understand why some
were so unhappy. In hindsight, I
can hardly blame them.
All told, the United States has
over 145,000 troops overseas, not
including the 40,000 involved in op
erations in Afghanistan and other
undisclosed regions. We have some
kind of military facility in nearly
180 countries. Though the majority
are small, with staffs of under 20
people, many are exceptionally
large. Japan hosts 54,000 U.S.
service members; Germany,
47,000; the United Kingdom,
13,000; Italy, 11,000. Several others
maintain staffs of between 1,000
and 5,000, such as the bases in
Turkey, Bahrain, Spain, and Portu
gal.

It all sounds eerily imperialistic.
And I can't help but wonder
would we be supportive of other su

perpowers who adopted similar poli
cies? It's hard to imagine a fully
equipped Russian or Chinese mili
tary base in Cuba or Venezuela be
ing seen as anything short of a dec
laration of war. A friend of mine re
cently pointed out that despite
strong American criticism of Russi
a's recent occupation of Crimea, it's
difficult to argue that the U.S. would
react any differently if one of our
host countries suffered a tumul
tuous revolution and the rise of a
popular anti-American government.
There's also the sheer cost of
the military-industrial complex.
Harvard University's Kennedy
School of Government estimates
that the Iraq and Afghanistan
Wars will ultimately cost $6 trillion
dollars the equivalent of more
than a third of the national debt.
Nearly 20 percent of the U.S. gov
ernment's budget is spent on de
fense, a sum that in 2011 famously
exceeded the defense spending of
the next 13 countries combined.
America's self-proclaimed prerog
ative to police the world, even if
morally justified, is monetarily un
sustainable.
The heart of the matter is that,
despite our intelligence programs,
superpower military and best in
tentions, we often don't know what
we are getting into. We never
know if the groups we are arming
will one day fight against us or if
the government we are putting in
power will be good for their people
or for ours. We never know when
our wars will spiral out of control
and turn into quagmires like Iraq
or Vietnam.
As we face the evolving crisis in
Ukraine, I pray our leaders re
member these lessons of the past
and recognize that the situation is
almost certainly more complex
than meets the eye. Should we
support a Ukraine that insists on
retaining Crimea, when 60 per
cent of the region identifies as
Russian? We have traditionally
supported self-determination: If
the Crimeans want to join Russia
or declare independence, should
we stop them? Thus far, I am un
convinced that taking sides on a
civil war on the other side of the
world is crucial to our national se
curity. Rather, I fear that any in
volvement will likely create more
enemies than sympathizers.
It is time to revisit the guidance
of our Founding Fathers. Thomas
Jefferson famously taught: "Peace,
commerce and honest friendship
with all nations ... entangling al
liances with none." In light of the
consequences of past intervention
ism, I am becoming ever more con
vinced that the best foreign policy
is one of peace, trade and diploma
cy. We need to let other nations re
solve their own conflicts.

countries all around the globe, doing
everything from gathering intelli
gence to training insurgents to fund
ing propaganda efforts.
Through it all, America has
been far from consistent in its
Western ideals, in several cases
opting to oust democratically elect
ed governments. Perhaps the most
famous of these was the overthrow
of Prime Minister Mossadegh of
Iran in 1953.
At other times, U.S. interven
tionism has inadvertently paved
the way for bloody dictators. In
2000, the CIA admitted to being
heavily involved in the ousting of
the democratically-elected Sal
vador Allende of Chile, which led to
the rise of the authoritarian Augus
to Pinochet in 1973. This dictator
would go on to kill over 3,000 of his
own people and torture nearly
30,000 others. During my two
years as a missionary in Chile, I
was able to see just how negatively
some view such involvement in the
affairs of others.
More than once, our interven
tionism has not only fueled anti-
American sentiments but directly
backfired. In the 1980s, the Rea
gan Administration gave weapons
and billions of dollars of aid to
Afghanistan in their fight against
the Soviet Union. During this same
time, the U.S. provided Iraq with
intelligence in their war against
Iran, turning a blind eye to Sad
dam Hussein's use of chemical
weapons, and ironically, the U.S.
was also selling weapons to Iran,
which resulted in the infamous
Iran-Contra Scandal. Years later,
we can fully appreciate the reper
cussions of our meddling in
Afghanistan and Iraq.
While our wars and foreign en
tanglements keep most people
more or less oblivious to the sub
tler realities of the American em
pire, military families such as my
own experience it firsthand. Dur
ing my family's six-year deploy
ment to Okinawa, Japan, we saw
massive protests from those who
didn't want our facilities on their
island. At the time, this broke my
heart I loved the Okinawans
and couldn't understand why some
were so unhappy. In hindsight, I
can hardly blame them.
All told, the United States has
over 145,000 troops overseas, not
including the 40,000 involved in op
erations in Afghanistan and other
undisclosed regions. We have some
kind of military facility in nearly
180 countries. Though the majority
are small, with staffs of under 20
people, many are exceptionally
large. Japan hosts 54,000 U.S.
service members; Germany,
47,000; the United Kingdom,
13,000; Italy, 11,000. Several others
maintain staffs of between 1,000
and 5,000, such as the bases in
Turkey, Bahrain, Spain, and Portu
gal.

It all sounds eerily imperialistic.
And I can't help but wonder
would we be supportive of other su

perpowers who adopted similar poli
cies? It's hard to imagine a fully
equipped Russian or Chinese mili
tary base in Cuba or Venezuela be
ing seen as anything short of a dec
laration of war. A friend of mine re
cently pointed out that despite
strong American criticism of Russi
a's recent occupation of Crimea, it's
difficult to argue that the U.S. would
react any differently if one of our
host countries suffered a tumul
tuous revolution and the rise of a
popular anti-American government.
There's also the sheer cost of
the military-industrial complex.
Harvard University's Kennedy
School of Government estimates
that the Iraq and Afghanistan
Wars will ultimately cost $6 trillion
dollars the equivalent of more
than a third of the national debt.
Nearly 20 percent of the U.S. gov
ernment's budget is spent on de
fense, a sum that in 2011 famously
exceeded the defense spending of
the next 13 countries combined.
America's self-proclaimed prerog
ative to police the world, even if
morally justified, is monetarily un
sustainable.
The heart of the matter is that,
despite our intelligence programs,
superpower military and best in
tentions, we often don't know what
we are getting into. We never
know if the groups we are arming
will one day fight against us or if
the government we are putting in
power will be good for their people
or for ours. We never know when
our wars will spiral out of control
and turn into quagmires like Iraq
or Vietnam.
As we face the evolving crisis in
Ukraine, I pray our leaders re
member these lessons of the past
and recognize that the situation is
almost certainly more complex
than meets the eye. Should we
support a Ukraine that insists on
retaining Crimea, when 60 per
cent of the region identifies as
Russian? We have traditionally
supported self-determination: If
the Crimeans want to join Russia
or declare independence, should
we stop them? Thus far, I am un
convinced that taking sides on a
civil war on the other side of the
world is crucial to our national se
curity. Rather, I fear that any in
volvement will likely create more
enemies than sympathizers.
It is time to revisit the guidance
of our Founding Fathers. Thomas
Jefferson famously taught: "Peace,
commerce and honest friendship
with all nations ... entangling al
liances with none." In light of the
consequences of past intervention
ism, I am becoming ever more con
vinced that the best foreign policy
is one of peace, trade and diploma
cy. We need to let other nations re
solve their own conflicts.

Asa 22-year-old college stu
/\ dent, I recognize lam not ex-
XApected to speak on foreign
policy. Yet I write today as both a
Marine Corps brat and a concerned
citizen who has seen his country in
a state of war for the greater part
of his life. I was only nine years old
when terrorists attacked the World
Trade Center, but since that time, I
have heard of nothing but wars and
rumors of wars in the Middle East
and elsewhere.
During the Bush Administra
tion, many spoke out against U.S.
military engagements abroad. But
since President Obama took office
in 2009, anti-war sentiments have
been much more subdued. The du
ration and distant nature of the
wars, combined with Americans'
overall lack of personal connection
to members of the Armed Forces,
have significantly diminished the
average citizen's ability to under
stand the human cost associated
with our presence there.
U.S. and coalition casualties
from Iraq and Afghanistan now to
tal 8,217 people. The Iraq Body
Count project reports that the Iraq
War has caused a massive 121,614
to 134,950 civilian casualties, but
even more staggeringly, a new 2013
study suggests that violence and
wartime conditions have been re
sponsible for over 500,000 civilian
deaths.
Sadly, our government has a
poor track record when it comes to
picking wars and interventions.
Much as the constant threat of ter
rorism breeds fear and encourages
big government today, the fear of
communism justified U.S. lawless
ness and interventionism abroad for
the greater part of the 20th century.
