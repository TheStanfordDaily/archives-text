# Beware of the "Bad": A Second Look at Ukraine
## 
### Anthony Ghosn 
Imagine if a popular pro-Chinese
movement in Tokyo toppled the
Japanese government today. Yes,
this scenario is extremely unlikely,
but indulge me for a moment. The
United States has very well-defined
interests inside Japan, including a
number of important military bases.
The Japanese government is our
largest ally in the area and a great
supporter of our regional interests.
Now imagine it was rumored that
the Chinese government had fanned
the flames of the revolution and that
it was intending to orchestrate the
institution of a new pro-Chinese gov
ernment.
The implications of such a revolu
tion would be enormous for Ameri
can trade, military and diplomatic
initiatives in Southeast Asia. As an
American citizen, I would expect
that our leadership would get in
volved in order to safeguard our mil
itary bases in Japan from the new
anti-American government and, for
one, to ensure that our weaponry
would stay under our control.
Russia has found itself in a very
similar position. Not only is the
Crimean city of Sevastopol the base
for Russia's Black Sea Fleet, the
peninsula is also home to four missile
regiments and a dozen active bases.
In addition, The New York Times re
ported that an overwhelming major
ity of Ukrainian nationals in Crimea
are native Russian speakers as op
posed to Ukrainian ones a legacy
of Crimea's long political association
with Russia. Add to that the fact that
the ouster of former president Vik
tor Yanukovych constitutes an effec
tive severance of Russian control
over the Ukrainian political class,
leaving the country open to Western
machinations.

In addition to the more abstract
ethnic and military losses, less con
trol over Ukraine means more eco
nomic exposure to Western interests

and less diplomatic independence for
Russia. To Russia, the Ukraine situ
ation is especially important because
Russia's economy is heavily depend
ent on oil exports to Europe, its
largest trading partner, which travel
primarily through Ukraine. In re
sponse to these circumstances, it
would be only sensible to, at the very
least, gather some political leverage
to ensure the Russian voice is consid
ered in deciding the fate of the na
tion.
Ostensibly, Russian people, Russ
ian military bases and Russian eco
nomic interests are jeopardized by
the recent revolution. I am con
vinced that any country with the
power to influence the region would
react similarly when facing this set
of pressures.
The Russian government has
continually stated that them control
of the peninsula is temporary and
that they have no intention of con
quering Ukraine. Despite many me
dia-born rumors about ultimatums,
Russia's foreign minister, Sergei
Lavrov, has continuously maintained
that the troops will simply remain
until there is a "normalization of the
political situation." He has ex
pressed concerns about the manifes
tation of anti-Russian sentiments in
Ukraine and reportedly wants to
protect ethnic Russian citizens from
potential abuse. Given the antago
nistic intensity of the protests on
both sides, this is not an absurd
proposition.
You may say that Russia should
have allowed the international rela
tions apparatus to decide the fate of
Ukraine in a fair and neutral way as
opposed to making such a boldly uni
lateral move. I would simply ask you
to refer to the effectiveness of inter
national relations forums in ensuring
political stability in the wake of a
revolution over the last half-decade:
Syria is still in a state of civil war and

Libya has essentially devolved into a
set of antagonistic factional king
doms. Not very promising to a Russ
ian statesman especially if there
are military and ethnic interests at
play.

These Russian justifications for
action are being totally ignored in
the popular American dialogue: Our
politicians, as well as news outlets,
are characterizing the temporary ef
fective annexation of Crimea as an
expansionist Russian move. Howev
er, an analysis from the Russian per
spective suggests that its current po
sition is not only a prudent but also a
shrewd geopolitical strategy in order
to safeguard its interest.
The American political and jour
nalistic irreverence for non-Ameri
can narratives of international rela
tions is extremely unhealthy, and
we've seen what kind of situations
they have put this country in time
and time again. Our press and politi
cians have historically undervalued
important cultural, social and histor
ical considerations when judging in
ternational foreign policy. This has
been most recently exemplified by
oui* naive interventions in Iraq and
Afghanistan, which both ignored
complex political dynamics in favor
of nationalistic fervor and dogmatic
appeals to a nebulous sense of jus
tice.

This is not to say that Russia is a
benevolent actor and that it should
be praised, but rather that interna
tional relations are complex and
"good versus bad" narratives usually
come at the expense of well thought
out and intelligent solutions. Recent
history has taught us that coherent
characterizations of certain interests
as being wholly bad usually are more
suggestive of manipulation than any
empirical reality.
