## Team America: World Police? 
### Nick Ahamed 
The world today is rife with
conflict. As I write, Russia's
parliament has just voted to
allow President Putin to send
troops into Ukraine. Less than 2,000
miles away, the Syrian Civil War
trudges on, taking 130,000 individu
als with it. In our hemisphere, Cara
cas, Venezuela is experiencing a
surge of violent riots. Bangkok, Thai
land has similar unrest.
Yet, where is the United States in
all of this? Ten years after the release
of Team America: World. Police,
it seems we may have shifted away
from that role. Indeed, Defense Sec
retary Chuck Hagel announced ma
jor cuts to the military last week.
This restructuring is best for our
fiscal health and for our national se
curity.
First, the new military budget in
cludes reform for TRICARE. TRI
CARE is a military program which
pays for almost all medical costs not
already covered by Medicare. For
that reason, as the Congressional
Budget Office states, "Because the
Department of Defense is a passive
payer in the program â€”it neither
manages care nor provides incen
tives for the cost-conscious use of
services it has virtually no means
of controlling the program's costs."
Hence the massive growth in health
care costs for the Department of De
fense.

Secretary Hagel recommended
that enrollment fees for Medicare-el
igible retirees should be enacted and
that the minimum out-of-pocket pay
ment increase by three percentage

points. In November of last year, the
CBO projected the effect of similar
plans, estimating that by 2023 the
former would save about $19.7 bil
lion, while the latter would save $30.7
billion.

More controversially, the new
budget involves reducing the size of
the Army by about 15 percent. The
primary strategic advantage of this
spending cut is that it allows for
troop preparedness, as measured by
average funding per military unit, to
stay the same. While savings will
come from decreases in aggregate
basic pay, they will also come from
areas like healthcare, where costs
have skyrocketed recently. Similarly,
spending on training and equipment
will decrease because there will be
fewer troops to train. Yet, the mili
tary will not be a "hollow force." Our
soldiers will be just as well-trained,
well-equipped and well-provided-for
as they were before the reductions.
Similarly, it allows the military to
focus on training the best soldiers.
Love it or hate it, President Obama's
military strategy policy has relied al
most entirely on decreasing troop de
ployments. Sec. Hagel argues we
must "protect critical capabilities like
Special Operations Forces and cyber
resources," which is why his plan
calls for a six-percent increase for
our special operations forces.
How Congress will react remains
to be seen. In the recent past, Con
gress has refused to enact cuts that
the Department of Defense itself rec
ommends. Take the Base Realign
ment and Closure (BRAC) commis

sion, for example. Not only did the
2005 round commission recommend
another set of closures in 2015, for
mer Defense Secretary Leon Panet
ta twice called for base closures. Clo
sures aren't a very politically palat
able decision, however, and Congress
responded by prohibiting future
BRAC rounds in the National De
fense Authorization Act passed last
December. (This is a point Sec. Hagel
highlighted in his speech outlining
the budget.)

Congress has likewise resisted
reducing spending on benefits. DoD
suggested a slowdown in pay raises
so that they would rise more compa
rably to civilian wages estimated
by the CBO to save about $25 billion
over 10 years. Congress said no.
Given this past and Senator Mar
co Rubio's remarks on American for
eign policy, the likelihood that Con
gress actually follows this budget

seems slim. He remarked that it was
"ironic" that "the U.S. is announcing
that we may be having troop levels as
low as they've been since before
World War II." He continued: "I
think that's a pretty startling con
trast in terms of where our priorities
are and what the world's challenges
look like."

Rubio and other Republican
"hawks" want to return to a time
where America did police the world.
They imagine U.S. forces patrolling
Eastern Europe, the Middle East
and Asia rebuking Russia, Iran
and China for their undemocratic
ways.

It is incumbent upon these Rep
resentatives and Senators to remem
ber that we are no longer in the Cold
War. There is no current existential
threat to the United States. As I've
previously detailed in this column,
American interventionism, even if
well-meaning, has often been shown
to be folly. Even though Russia has
just intervened in Ukraine, our mili
tary needs not scour the worlds'
roads for speeding drivers.

A smarter model for the U.S. mil
itary is that of the lire depot. It
should be agile and strong enough to
respond swiftly to emergency calls
when our house is on fire. Secretary
Hagel's recommendations redesign
the department to fulfill that mis
sion while still complying with the
dual mandate conservatives have
set him to decrease spending.
