# Controversy in Slav departures
## Drug-centered event prompts firing, recriminations and resignation 
### MARSHALL WATKINS EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
A Slavianskii Dom staff mem
ber was fired and the house's resi
dent assistant (RA) driven to resig
nation last week, following fallout
from a drug-centered event held at
the house.
According to house residents,
the Feb. 22 event which was
hosted privately by the house's
community manager featured a
large amount of pot in various edi
ble forms. In an open email to the
house mailing list, the RA argued
that the lack of warning given and
the risk of inadvertent or excessive

consumption by residents obliged
her to consult the Row's residence
dean (RD), who subsequently in
structed her to shut the event
down.
"I called the RD because it was
my job, and also because I wanted
to do right by you, and because I
was worried for your safety," she
wrote in the email.
Following meetings between
University administrators and
house staff, the community manag
er was fired last week and barred
from returning to the house.
The decision to report the event
and implicate a fellow staff mem
ber to the residence dean received

extensive criticism from Slav resi
dents. House members argued
that the community manager
should not have been reported by a
fellow staff member without prior
warning or consultation among the
staff, and more than 30 residents
authored character references for
the community manager prior to
his dismissal.
In her email to the house, the
resident assistant framed the hos
tile reception to her decision as
making her continued role in the
house untenable. She resigned
Tuesday evening.
"I stand by my decision 100% to
pick up the phone and ask the RD

for help on Saturday," she wrote. "I
have not been able to sleep for days
because this has been unbelievably
stressful, but in a few weeks, I
know that I will rest easy knowing
that I did the right thing by all of
you."
"I assure you that your efforts
to make me feel unwelcome in a
community I have put so much ef
fort, care, and love into were the
absolute LAST things I needed
yesterday," she added, addressing
residents who had expressed criti
cism. "You have made this a toxic
environment for me and are the
reason I am choosing to leave it."
Slav residents portrayed the in
cident as reflective of longstanding
issues with this year's staff, in
terms of both intra-staff communi
cation and engagement with resi
dents. Residents also critiqued an
alleged lack of engagement by
University administrators, noting
that they had received no official
communications until Tuesday.
Residential Education Associ
ate Dean Nate Boswell '99 M.A. 'O9
emphasized the challenges of re
placing two staff members from
the same house at the same time.

"The removal of a staff member
for any reason generally reveals a
whole bunch of other things that
might have been going on within
the community," Boswell said.
"Those houses are often a very in
timate community for people so
any transition can be pretty disrup
tive."
"Most of the time, generally
speaking, these situations are com
plicated," he added. "Those choic
es can impact the health of the
house ... so especially when there's
an incident or a set of concerns
that trigger an action like this,
subsequently there are a lot of con
versations to have... to figure out
the best course of action."

According to Boswell, Slav staff
members and staff from other Row
houses collaborated to compensate

for the two lost staff members over
the past week. Slav's resident com
puter consultant has since been
named as the dorm's new resident
assistant, while the search for an
other community manager and res
ident computer consultant contin
ues. Boswell said that replacement
staff would likely be drawn from
current residents.
"Because the house, by this time
of the year, tends to be quite close...
it's least disruptive to solicit exist
ing staff members or existing resi
dents," he explained. "That said, it's
not unheard of to solicit students
from outside the house and depend
ing on the circumstances that's
sometimes actually to the benefit."

ber to the residence dean received

extensive criticism from Slav resi
dents. House members argued
that the community manager
should not have been reported by a
fellow staff member without prior
warning or consultation among the
staff, and more than 30 residents
authored character references for
the community manager prior to
his dismissal.
In her email to the house, the
resident assistant framed the hos
tile reception to her decision as
making her continued role in the
house untenable. She resigned
Tuesday evening.
"I stand by my decision 100% to
pick up the phone and ask the RD

for help on Saturday," she wrote. "I
have not been able to sleep for days
because this has been unbelievably
stressful, but in a few weeks, I
know that I will rest easy knowing
that I did the right thing by all of
you."
"I assure you that your efforts
to make me feel unwelcome in a
community I have put so much ef
fort, care, and love into were the
absolute LAST things I needed
yesterday," she added, addressing
residents who had expressed criti
cism. "You have made this a toxic
environment for me and are the
reason I am choosing to leave it."
Slav residents portrayed the in
cident as reflective of longstanding
issues with this year's staff, in
terms of both intra-staff communi
cation and engagement with resi
dents. Residents also critiqued an
alleged lack of engagement by
University administrators, noting
that they had received no official
communications until Tuesday.
Residential Education Associ
ate Dean Nate Boswell '99 M.A. 'O9
emphasized the challenges of re
placing two staff members from
the same house at the same time.

"The removal of a staff member
for any reason generally reveals a
whole bunch of other things that
might have been going on within
the community," Boswell said.
"Those houses are often a very in
timate community for people so
any transition can be pretty disrup
tive."
"Most of the time, generally
speaking, these situations are com
plicated," he added. "Those choic
es can impact the health of the
house ... so especially when there's
an incident or a set of concerns
that trigger an action like this,
subsequently there are a lot of con
versations to have... to figure out
the best course of action."

According to Boswell, Slav staff
members and staff from other Row
houses collaborated to compensate

for the two lost staff members over
the past week. Slav's resident com
puter consultant has since been
named as the dorm's new resident
assistant, while the search for an
other community manager and res
ident computer consultant contin
ues. Boswell said that replacement
staff would likely be drawn from
current residents.
"Because the house, by this time
of the year, tends to be quite close...
it's least disruptive to solicit exist
ing staff members or existing resi
dents," he explained. "That said, it's
not unheard of to solicit students
from outside the house and depend
ing on the circumstances that's
sometimes actually to the benefit."

and drove the residential assistant to resign following criticism from residents for reporting the incident.
