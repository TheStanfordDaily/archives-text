# Controversy in Slav departures
## Drug-centered event prompts firing, recriminations and resignation 
### MARSHALL WATKINS EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
A Slavianskii Dom staff mem
ber was fired and the house's resi
dent assistant (RA) driven to resig
nation last week, following fallout
from a drug-centered event held at
the house.
According to house residents,
the Feb. 22 event which was
hosted privately by the house's
community manager featured a
large amount of pot in various edi
ble forms. In an open email to the
house mailing list, the RA argued
that the lack of warning given and
the risk of inadvertent or excessive

consumption by residents obliged
her to consult the Row's residence
dean (RD), who subsequently in
structed her to shut the event
down.
"I called the RD because it was
my job, and also because I wanted
to do right by you, and because I
was worried for your safety," she
wrote in the email.
Following meetings between
University administrators and
house staff, the community manag
er was fired last week and barred
from returning to the house.
The decision to report the event
and implicate a fellow staff mem
ber to the residence dean received

extensive criticism from Slav resi
dents. House members argued
that the community manager
should not have been reported by a
fellow staff member without prior
warning or consultation among the
staff, and more than 30 residents
authored character references for
the community manager prior to
his dismissal.
In her email to the house, the
resident assistant framed the hos
tile reception to her decision as
making her continued role in the
house untenable. She resigned
Tuesday evening.
"I stand by my decision 100% to
pick up the phone and ask the RD

for help on Saturday," she wrote. "I
have not been able to sleep for days
because this has been unbelievably
stressful, but in a few weeks, I
know that I will rest easy knowing
that I did the right thing by all of
you."
"I assure you that your efforts
to make me feel unwelcome in a
community I have put so much ef
fort, care, and love into were the
absolute LAST things I needed
yesterday," she added, addressing
residents who had expressed criti
cism. "You have made this a toxic
environment for me and are the
