## Undergraduates seek rigor of graduate level courses 
### PETER MOON DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Although graduate students may seem to
occupy a Stanford of their own, a number of
graduate-level classes remain open to willing
undergraduates. The Daily took a look at
some of the best courses on offer for under
graduates in search of a challenge.
American foreign policy in Asia
International Policy Studies 264: Behind
the Headlines, taught by former State De
partment official and current Center for In
ternational Security and Cooperation affiliate
Anja Manuel '96 M.A. '96, is advertised as an
introduction to U.S. foreign policy in South
and East Asia.
Although the small 25-student seminar
class is known for attracting a diverse and ex
perienced array of students from an
Afghanistan veteran to a former Chinese
diplomat Manuel said that that shouldn't
deter undergraduates from applying.
In fact, the class is open to juniors and
seniors who have a good understanding of the
history of China, India, Afghanistan and Pak
istan. The class assumes that the students
are familiar with these regions already, given
that its first four weeks cover 2000 years of
South and East Asian history, and Manuel
warned prospective undergraduates to be
prepared for a heavy workload.
"I assign lots of reading, require lots of
class participation and try to teach the stu
dents how to make effective policy choices,"
Manuel said. "The papers I assign are short
memos, similar to those that one would write
for the Secretary of State. I require concise

and effective writing."
Exploring China's transformation
Other graduate-level faculty offered a less
intimidating portrayal of their classes.
Political Science 148/348: Chinese Politics:
The Transformation and the Era of Reform is
a spring quarter introductory course taught

by Professor of Political Science Jean Oi. The
class is practically split evenly between grad
uate students and undergraduates.
Oi explained that the class is not curved
and focuses on writing generally and how to
do research, gather information and formu-

"The students do everything ex

paper," Oi said. "You pick a topic of
your interest, find out what the ar
guments are, what the debates
are, look at sources and assess
your topic."
Oi emphasized that undergradu
ate students should not be deterred
by concerns about grading.
"Every year I can remember
many freshmen that have taken
this class and ended up with the
highest grades," Oi said.
Unusual offerings
It isn't just undergraduates who
have rather non-traditional profes
sors graduate students have
their fair share of interesting pro
fessors as well.
Physics 230: Quantum Mechan
ics, a course focused on high-level
theoretical physics, is taught in the
winter quarter by Professor of

Physics Leonard Susskind. Consid
ered the "bad boy" of physics by
Scientific American, Susskind is de
scribed by his students as charis
matic, with a big beard and a low,
gruff voice.
Although the material may
seem daunting in name, students
affirmed that taking a Susskind
taught course is well worth it.
"First day of class, he walked in
like a badass, proceeded to remove
his coat to reveal his SpaceX
pullover underneath," said Robert
Harlow 'l4, a student in the class.
