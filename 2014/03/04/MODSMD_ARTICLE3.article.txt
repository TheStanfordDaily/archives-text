## Undergraduates seek rigor of graduate level courses 
### PETER MOON DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Although graduate students may seem to
occupy a Stanford of their own, a number of
graduate-level classes remain open to willing
undergraduates. The Daily took a look at
some of the best courses on offer for under
graduates in search of a challenge.
American foreign policy in Asia
International Policy Studies 264: Behind
the Headlines, taught by former State De
partment official and current Center for In
ternational Security and Cooperation affiliate
Anja Manuel '96 M.A. '96, is advertised as an
introduction to U.S. foreign policy in South
and East Asia.
Although the small 25-student seminar
class is known for attracting a diverse and ex

In fact, the class is open to juniors and
seniors who have a good understanding of the
history of China, India, Afghanistan and Pak

are familiar with these regions already, given
that its first four weeks cover 2000 years of
South and East Asian history, and Manuel
warned prospective undergraduates to be
prepared for a heavy workload.
"I assign lots of reading, require lots of
class participation and try to teach the stu
dents how to make effective policy choices,"
Manuel said. "The papers I assign are short
memos, similar to those that one would write
for the Secretary of State. I require concise

and effective writing."
Exploring China's transformation
Other graduate-level faculty offered a less
intimidating portrayal of their classes.
Political Science 148/348: Chinese Politics:
The Transformation and the Era of Reform is
a spring quarter introductory course taught

by Professor of Political Science Jean Oi. The
class is practically split evenly between grad
uate students and undergraduates.
Oi explained that the class is not curved
and focuses on writing generally and how to
do research, gather information and formu-
