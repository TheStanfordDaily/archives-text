## Court opens Jasper Ridge to inspection 
### KYLIE JUE DESK EDITOR 
A federal judge recently ordered Stanford
to permit two environmental groups to inspect
the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, follow
ing the filing of lawsuits last year over the Uni
versity's operation of the Searsville Dam.
Our Children's Earth initially filed suit
against the University in January 2013, alleg
ing that Stanford had harmed local popula
tions of the endangered steelhead trout and vi
olated the Endangered Species Act through
the diversion of millions of gallons of water
from the San Francisquito Creek for irrigation
purposes.
The organization also argued that Stan
ford's construction of the Jasper Ridge Road
Crossing and support for a water pipeline vio
lated the Clean Water Act and has resulted in
the discharge of sediments and pollutants into
the creek.
Both sides had agreed to allow the plain
tiffs' expert three seasonal inspections of the
dam and related areas. Although the first in
spection occurred at the end of August, the
second, which was supposed to happen during
the rainy season, caused some controversy
over the definition of a seasonal inspection.
Our Children's Earth argued that seasonal in
spections should occur in the fall, winter and
spring, while Stanford argued that the
drought should stall the first wet
weather inspection until a signifi
cant rain.
Our Children's Earth also al
leged that the University has dis
charged sediment and pollutants
from the pipeline valve at the base
of the Searsville Dam into the
Corte Madera Creek. However,
Stanford argued that those accusa
tions were not part of the original
claims.
U.S. District Court Judge Ju
dith Laporte sided with Our Chil
dren's Earth, ruling that four peo
ple would be allowed to access the
area to take samples and measure
ments. However, she ruled against
the organization's request to ex
tend the inspection beyond the ini
tially disputed area.
Director of Community Rela
tions Jean McCown said that Stan
ford was concerned about the
methods for testing the sensitive
areas, information which the plain
tiffs did not initially make avail
able. The scope and methods of
samples were later laid out in court
and approved by the judge.
The inspection took place on
Feb. 28. However, the recent rain
has left the issue of a dry-inspec
tion unresolved.

Two outside environmental groups were recently allowed to inspect the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve following a judge's ruling. The groups
had filed lawsuits against the University last January that alleged that the operation of the Searsville Dam violated the Endangered Species Act.
