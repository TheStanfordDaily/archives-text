## Coursera blocked overseas Sanctions bar MOOC sites from Cuba, Iran and Sudan 
### KYLIE JUE DESK EDITOR 
Coursera, the popular online
learning platform founded by two
Stanford computer science profes
sors, recently blocked access to
users in Cuba, Iran and Sudan in
order to comply with federal ex
port regulations prohibiting mas
sive open online course (MOOC)
providers from operating in sanc
tioned countries.
Coursera announced the ban at
the end of January, and has since
engaged in a dialogue on the issue
with the State Department.
"I want to give everyone access
to a great education," said Andrew
Ng, Coursera's co-founder. "Hav
ing to block certain countries is not
well-aligned with the mission of
Coursera."
The site currently uses an IP
block to prevent users from sanc
tioned countries from logging in.
Ng said that students, employees
and company partners had been
upset by the obstruction.
"This is something that affects
us and our university partners
deeply," Ng said. "[A few weeks
ago], I was in Europe speaking
with one of our university partners
and trying to offer course content
to a refugee camp in Sudan."
Ng added that Coursera has
had positive conversations with
the State Department and ex
pressed hope for a constructive
resolution. Coursera has also ap
plied for a license to resume full
service in the sanctioned coun
tries.
The U.S. Department of Trea
sury's Office of Foreign Assets
Control (OFAC), which handles li
censing of content such as Cours
era's, declined to comment on the
specific license, but noted that the
need for an educational content
specific OFAC license had been
voided in certain cases (such as the
recent sanctions against Syria).
"OFAC has a favorable licensing
policy to authorize U.S. persons to
engage in certain targeted educa
tional, cultural and sports exchange
programs, as well as research and
humanitarian projects that are de
signed to benefit people in sanc
tioned countries," an OFAC spokes
woman wrote in an email to The
Daily. "Of course, under a favorable
licensing policy, U.S. persons need
to come in and seek a license
without that, we cannot act."
"OFAC, in consultation with

the State Department, will contin
ue to consider requests by U.S.
persons to engage in activities to
provide online courses and certifi
cates of mastery to persons locat
ed in or ordinarily resident in
sanctioned countries," she added.
According to Ng, the State De
partment has been very helpful in
providing advice to navigate the
situation.
"I think [the State Departmen
t's] and our interests are actually
well-aligned in that we would like
to give the users in these countries
access to a great education," Ng
said. "However, we just need to
find away to do so that is in full
compliance with the law."
