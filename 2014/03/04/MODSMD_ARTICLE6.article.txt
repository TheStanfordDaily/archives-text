# LIFE ON THE MAT
## AN UNPRECEDENTED YEAR FOR STANFORD WRESTLING 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
CC Y I Two! That's two!
I TWO! TWOOOO!" It
wasn't just the trio of
coaches who rocketed
out of then' chairs as if
their seats had suddenly become red-hot,
screaming at the tops of their lungs for
points to be awarded while pointing at the
two tangled bodies on the far side of the
black mat. It was also the pair of athletes
standing behind them coaches at the edge
of the mat, voicing their displeasure to the
referee as they jumped up and down. And
it was also the section of fans clad in cardi
nal red that bounded to its feet in unison,
yelling and gesturing, filling the vastness
of Maples Pavilion with its collective voice.

Senior Dan Scherer (right) won the 197-pound
title at the Pac- 12 Championships.
The referee stared intent
ly at the squirming knot of
bodies at his feet, analyzing
the placement of the limbs,
the forces being exerted in all
directions and the raw deter
mination of two individuals,
each straining with all his
might to overcome the other.
All of a sudden, his right
hand shot up, two fingers
pointed skyward, extensions
of an arm wrapped with a red
sweatband. Two points,
red.
The whistle signaling the
break of the tie and the
end of the match —was lost
in the overwhelming roar
that arose from the small
Stanford section of the
bleachers. Although there
couldn't have been more than
200 of them, the din that they
raised was akin to the pande
monium after a game-win
ning buzzer-beater or a walk
off home run.
Senior Dan Scherer stood
in the center of the mat with
an exhausted yet triumphant
grin, hand held high by the
referee signaling his victory
one more tally in the most
successful season in team his
tory and one final conquest in
front of the Stanford faithful.
On Sunday, that roar in
side Maples Pavilion wasn't
for a double alley-oop for
Cardinal men's basketball,
nor was it for another confer
ence title for women's basket
ball. Instead, it was in recog
nition of Stanford wrestling
a team largely overlooked
and forgotten that had faded
into relative obscurity on
campus —because on Sun
day, with the Pac-12 Champi
onships held on the Farm for
the first time since 2006, the
team capped off a regular
season in which it thundered
back to relevance, establish
ing a presence that looks to
be here to stay.

Walking into the wrestling
room in the basement of the

Arrillaga Family Sports Cen
ter two days before the Pac-12
Championship, you can feel it
in the air. No, not the hint of
stale sweat left over from tire
less weeks of preparation. You
can feel the energy, the buzz
and the camaraderie of the
group of individuals sprawled
out on the dull red mat. Look
ing around, you get the sense
that the term "group of indi
viduals" doesn't quite do jus
tice to the young men com

pletely at ease throwing
around playful banter or casu
ally practicing pinning each
other. This is a team, in every
sense of the term.

From the 5-foot-2, 125-
pound Evan Silver to the 6-
foot-1, 285-pound Josh Mar
chok, the members of this
team have forged a bond
through their combined suc
cesses and failures in a his
toric season, one in which
they are looking to capture
the first conference title in
school history after breaking
the school record for the most
dual-meet wins in a season.
For veterans like fifth-year
senior Ryan Mango, the sea
son has been a testament to
just how much the program
has improved in such a short
period of time from just
eight dual wins during the
2008-2009 season to 17 this
season.

"When I first came here,
that was really the emphasis,
even when I was being re
cruited here," Mango said.
"[Head coach Jason] Borrelli
emphasized trying to turn the
program around and being in
a program that's respected,
and really making that
change happen rather than
talking about it. So through
out the past four or five years,
we've had our ups and downs
and... it's finally paying off a
little bit this year."
Mango is one of the estab
lished leaders of the team. A
two-time Ail-American and
three-time competitor at na
tional tournaments, he is one
of the most experienced
wrestlers in the country and
will be looking to claim his
second consecutive Pac-12 ti
tle after redshirting his senior
year while moving up weight
classes from 125 pounds to
133. His 106 career wins
speak for themselves. Even
more so, it's his maturity and
perseverance outside compe
tition that have been signifi
cant to not only the team, but

also to the development of
head coach Jason Borrelli,
whose young coaching career
was profoundly affected by
Mango's actions during the
wrestler's time at Stanford.
"You'd like to think as a
coach that you're doing a lot
of teaching and coaching, but
Ryan has actually helped our
coaching staff in so many
ways," Borrelli said. "Little
things about persevering
through injuries, and for me

as a young coach who was still
trying to ... figure out the
mindset of a student-athlete,
Ryan is one of the first kids
that I remember kind of
changed the expectations that
I've put on young kids."
Mango particularly im
pacted Borrelli's mindset dur
ing his sophomore year, when
he was injured leading up to
the national tournament and
was strongly discouraged by
doctors from wrestling at the
championships after not hav
ing trained for several weeks.
But Mango just wouldn't give
in. He wanted to be an All-
American, and partially torn
ligaments weren't going to
stop him from achieving his
goal.

"I'm sitting here trying to
tell him he's not going to be
able to wrestle and he can't be
an Ail-American," Borrelli
said. "And he's telling me the
exact opposite, and I grew a
lot as a coach and I recognized
that there are kids that are
motivated at a different level
at that age. For a long time, I
thought that a kid didn't
reach that until he was much
older. And so now as a coach,
the expectation from our staff
has been, you come in as a
freshman and you expect to
win."
Mango competed at the
NCAA Championship that
year wearing knee braces. He
finished sixth in the 125-
pound tournament and
achieved his goal of earning
Ail-American honors.
This toughness symbol
ized a turning point and
resurgence in Stanford
wrestling, a dramatic turn
around fueled at least in part
by the success of a young
Ryan Mango and its effect on
a young head coach, as well as
the emergence of star
wrestler and NCAA Champi
onship runner-up Nick
Amuchastegui 'll. The in
creased expectations placed
on freshmen, spurred by the
development of that 2009 re
cruiting class Mango, Kyle
Meyer and Bret Baumbach
and the mutual learning
between player and coach are
especially evident in the 2014
team, set to be one of the best
if not the best in school his
tory.
"We came in, and we were
the worst team in the Pac-12
and we were pretty far down
there coming in my freshman
year," Meyer said. "To kind of
see the atmosphere and see
the people coming in behind
us the new recruits,
they're just getting better
and better. And it's exciting
that we started the legacy...
We're starting a new decade
of Stanford wrestling being in
the top 25, at least, and com
peting for a national champi
onship at the NCAAs."

This year's Stanford
wrestling squad marked the
convergence of two critical
groups the seniors who
had paved the way for fresh
men to excel, and the fresh
men who embraced their po
tential to help turn over a new
leaf for the program. With the
groups coming together, a dis
tinct dynamic emerged in
which the entities mutually
aided one another: While the
veterans helped ease the
freshmen's transition into the
collegiate game, the fresh
men, in turn, helped the vet
erans by bringing a new
spark to the team that quickly
became infectious and moti
vating.

"I don't think our seniors
and juniors view our fresh
men as freshmen, although
they are," Borrelli said. "They
view them as guys who can do
really well. And so when that

happens, it just brings a dif
ferent mindset to the whole
program... In just having one
or two freshmen that are hav
ing really good years, it moti
vates everybody."
"It's my fifth year here, so
I've gone through a lot of
grind," Meyer added. "Next
year, I don't have to do the
three-mile run or this work
out or really grueling stuff,
but when you look at those
[young] guys, they're really
excited, and it brings in, 'hey,
wrestling is fun and compet
ing is fun,' so it kind of helps
bring it back into perspec
tive."
Not only did the freshmen
bring with them confident and
enthusiastic mindsets, they
also brought superb talent
that made an immediate im
pact on the team. The youth
movement was led by redshirt
freshman Jim Wilson, who
finished the regular season
ranked 18th in the country in
the 165-pound weight class.
Armed with the talent to
make a big splash in the
standings, Borrelli and the
Cardinal plunged into the sea
son with confidence and ex
citement, hoping that a deep
er roster would lead them
back to national prominence.
"We set a goal at the be
ginning of the year to make
this kind of a year of firsts,"
Borrelli said. "A season of
firsts, meaning that we want
ed to win the first conference
championship, we wanted to
have the most dual meet vic
tories in a season, we wanted
to send the most individuals to
the national tournament."
After the Cardinal easily
put away dual victories over
Cal Baptist, Menlo College
and Air Force to open the sea
son before scraping past
Maryland, it pulled off a
tough road upset of then-No.
17 Michigan that Wilson iden
tified as a defining point in the
season.
"Coach Borrelli had told
us how good we could be and
we'd done all the training,"
Wilson said. "I think when we
beat Michigan, it was a real
ization. Everyone went, 'Oh,
wow. We can actually hang in
there with those guys. We can
beat those best teams.' So it
was like the first step in
everyone realizing, 'Wow, we
can actually do this.'"
Even though the Cardinal
hit its share of bumps while it
plowed through its dual
schedule, Borrelli saw the po
tential in his team and be
lieved that the team's ability
to bounce back from tough
losses displayed a maturity
and resilience demonstrative
of its mental toughness, which
was another element that set
it apart from the teams of
years past.
"We have just never fallen
too far, even when we've got
ten knocked down," Borrelli
said. "I was interested to see
how we were going to respond
[to tough losses], and we nev
er stayed down. Every time
we got knocked down, it took
us only the next match to get
back up... That's when you
know our kids' minds are
strong."
And indeed, the Cardinal
never dropped consecutive
matches while navigating it
self to a 17-5 dual meet record
to set the new school record
for dual victories in a season,
and three of its losses were
decided by less than ten
points. With wins over schools
like Michigan, Central Michi
gan and Boise State, the Car
dinal indeed showed itself —
and the nation that it could
contend with some of the best
teams in the country.

Although the Cardinal
caught a solid groove towards
the end of its season as it
rolled to eight straight dual

victories in a one-month
stretch spanning late January
and early February, it suf
fered a major setback when
senior Bret Baumbach, co
captain and defending Pac-12
title winner, suffered a knee
injury that cut his career
short and sent him to the
bench for the rest of the sea
son. With the loss of Baum
bach, the Cardinal was down
one of its stalwart corner
stones.

In the wake of such a sig
nificant loss, the Cardinal
could have folded and allowed
the forfeiture of Baumbach's
production on the mat to hin
der its progress moving into
the finale of its season.
"If Bret had pity on him
self, it would have hurt the
team," Wilson said.
But Baumbach, who had
seen and experienced the me
teoric transformation of the
program firsthand during his
five years as a Stanford
wrestler, refused to drag the
team down with him and made
the most of an unfortunate
turn of events with his leader
ship and positivity. If he could
n't make an impact on the mat,
he was going to be sure to
make an impact off of it.
"Even though he tore both
ligaments in his knee and he
was completely out, he'd come
in every day, giving every
body high-fives, telling them
how great they were going to
do, giving guys back mas
sages, trying to keep them
loose and pumping everybody
up," Wilson said. "Bret's just
such an incredible guy that he
took that injury and just
turned it into a ton of positive
energy just to try to uplift the
entire team. It was really
through Bret's example that
built everybody up."
The record-breaking sea
son, the shared perspective
and Baumbach's injury
served to unite Stanford's
squad into an inseparable
brotherhood as the Pac-12
Championship rapidly ap
proached, representing the
seniors' final chance to see
their efforts come to fruition
with the first-ever conference
championship in school histo
ry. And making the stage even
more fitting, the champi
onship was to be held at Stan

ford for the first time since
2006, giving the seniors the
opportunity to make history
in front of the home crowd
that had meant so much to
them over the last five years.
"I think to the young kids,
[a conference championship]
might not mean as much be
cause they're freshmen and
sophomores, and they feel like
they have other opportunities
to win it," Borrelli added.
"But I think for our seniors,
it's really meaningful. To be at
home and have a chance to do
it here, that would mean a lot
to the guys."
In a season that Borrelli
wanted to define through
"firsts," the Cardinal had al
ready accomplished one of its
goals: It had set the new
record for most dual wins in a
season. And with both the vet
erans and younger wrestlers
in peak condition and looking
forward to wrestling in front
of them home fans, the time
seemed ripe for more history
to be made going into the Pac
-12 Championship.
But arguably, even more
significant than that was an
other first that could not nec
essarily go down in the record
books like dual wins or confer
ence championships the in
credibly strong bond and
sense of unity that the team
possessed after having navi
gated the peaks and valleys of
the season as a cohesive unit.
'Anyone would give the
shirt off his back to another
guy," Wilson said. "We trust
each other; everyone trusts
each other completely, every
one's really close. It's definite
ly just the way you would feel
about a brother. I mean, you
trust your brother, you die for
your brother, you'd do any
thing for your brother. And
that's just the way the whole
team is."

was completely out, he'd come
in every day, giving every
body high-fives, telling them
how great they were going to
do, giving guys back mas
sages, trying to keep them
loose and pumping everybody
up," Wilson said. "Bret's just
such an incredible guy that he
took that injury and just
turned it into a ton of positive
energy just to try to uplift the
entire team. It was really
through Bret's example that
built everybody up."
The record-breaking sea
son, the shared perspective
and Baumbach's injury
served to unite Stanford's
squad into an inseparable
brotherhood as the Pac-12
Championship rapidly ap
proached, representing the
seniors' final chance to see
their efforts come to fruition
with the first-ever conference
championship in school histo
ry. And making the stage even
more fitting, the champi
onship was to be held at Stan

ford for the first time since
2006, giving the seniors the
opportunity to make history
in front of the home crowd
that had meant so much to
them over the last five years.
"I think to the young kids,
[a conference championship]
might not mean as much be
cause they're freshmen and
sophomores, and they feel like
they have other opportunities
to win it," Borrelli added.
"But I think for our seniors,
it's really meaningful. To be at
home and have a chance to do
it here, that would mean a lot
to the guys."
In a season that Borrelli
wanted to define through
"firsts," the Cardinal had al
ready accomplished one of its
goals: It had set the new
record for most dual wins in a
season. And with both the vet
erans and younger wrestlers
in peak condition and looking
forward to wrestling in front
of them home fans, the time
seemed ripe for more history
to be made going into the Pac
-12 Championship.
But arguably, even more
significant than that was an
other first that could not nec
essarily go down in the record
books like dual wins or confer
ence championships the in
credibly strong bond and
sense of unity that the team
possessed after having navi
gated the peaks and valleys of
the season as a cohesive unit.
'Anyone would give the
shirt off his back to another
guy," Wilson said. "We trust
each other; everyone trusts
each other completely, every
one's really close. It's definite
ly just the way you would feel
about a brother. I mean, you
trust your brother, you die for
your brother, you'd do any
thing for your brother. And
that's just the way the whole
team is."

coaches who rocketed
out of then' chairs as if
their seats had suddenly become red-hot,
screaming at the tops of their lungs for

Senior Dan Scherer (right) won the 197-pound

The referee stared intent

bodies at his feet, analyzing
the placement of the limbs,
the forces being exerted in all

All of a sudden, his right

of an arm wrapped with a red
sweatband. Two points,
red.
The whistle signaling the
break of the tie and the
end of the match —was lost
in the overwhelming roar
that arose from the small
Stanford section of the
bleachers. Although there
couldn't have been more than
200 of them, the din that they
raised was akin to the pande
monium after a game-win
ning buzzer-beater or a walk
off home run.
Senior Dan Scherer stood
in the center of the mat with
an exhausted yet triumphant
grin, hand held high by the
referee signaling his victory
one more tally in the most
successful season in team his
tory and one final conquest in
front of the Stanford faithful.
On Sunday, that roar in
side Maples Pavilion wasn't
for a double alley-oop for
Cardinal men's basketball,
nor was it for another confer
ence title for women's basket
ball. Instead, it was in recog
nition of Stanford wrestling
a team largely overlooked
and forgotten that had faded
into relative obscurity on
campus —because on Sun
day, with the Pac-12 Champi
onships held on the Farm for
the first time since 2006, the
team capped off a regular
season in which it thundered
back to relevance, establish
ing a presence that looks to
be here to stay.

Walking into the wrestling
room in the basement of the

Arrillaga Family Sports Cen
ter two days before the Pac-12
Championship, you can feel it
in the air. No, not the hint of
stale sweat left over from tire
less weeks of preparation. You
can feel the energy, the buzz
and the camaraderie of the
group of individuals sprawled
out on the dull red mat. Look
ing around, you get the sense
that the term "group of indi
viduals" doesn't quite do jus
tice to the young men com

pletely at ease throwing
around playful banter or casu
ally practicing pinning each
other. This is a team, in every
sense of the term.

From the 5-foot-2, 125-
pound Evan Silver to the 6-
foot-1, 285-pound Josh Mar
chok, the members of this
team have forged a bond
through their combined suc
cesses and failures in a his
toric season, one in which
they are looking to capture
the first conference title in
school history after breaking
the school record for the most
dual-meet wins in a season.
For veterans like fifth-year
senior Ryan Mango, the sea
son has been a testament to
just how much the program
has improved in such a short
period of time from just
eight dual wins during the
2008-2009 season to 17 this
season.

"When I first came here,
that was really the emphasis,
even when I was being re
cruited here," Mango said.
"[Head coach Jason] Borrelli
emphasized trying to turn the
program around and being in
a program that's respected,
and really making that
change happen rather than
talking about it. So through
out the past four or five years,
we've had our ups and downs
and... it's finally paying off a
little bit this year."
Mango is one of the estab
lished leaders of the team. A
two-time Ail-American and
three-time competitor at na
tional tournaments, he is one
of the most experienced
wrestlers in the country and
will be looking to claim his
second consecutive Pac-12 ti
tle after redshirting his senior
year while moving up weight
classes from 125 pounds to
133. His 106 career wins
speak for themselves. Even
more so, it's his maturity and
perseverance outside compe
tition that have been signifi
cant to not only the team, but

also to the development of
head coach Jason Borrelli,
whose young coaching career
was profoundly affected by
Mango's actions during the
wrestler's time at Stanford.
"You'd like to think as a
coach that you're doing a lot
of teaching and coaching, but
Ryan has actually helped our
coaching staff in so many
ways," Borrelli said. "Little
things about persevering
through injuries, and for me

as a young coach who was still
trying to ... figure out the
mindset of a student-athlete,
Ryan is one of the first kids
that I remember kind of
changed the expectations that
I've put on young kids."
Mango particularly im
pacted Borrelli's mindset dur
ing his sophomore year, when
he was injured leading up to
the national tournament and
was strongly discouraged by
doctors from wrestling at the
championships after not hav
ing trained for several weeks.
But Mango just wouldn't give
in. He wanted to be an All-
American, and partially torn
ligaments weren't going to
stop him from achieving his
goal.

"I'm sitting here trying to
tell him he's not going to be
able to wrestle and he can't be
an Ail-American," Borrelli
said. "And he's telling me the
exact opposite, and I grew a
lot as a coach and I recognized
that there are kids that are
motivated at a different level
at that age. For a long time, I
thought that a kid didn't
reach that until he was much
older. And so now as a coach,
the expectation from our staff
has been, you come in as a
freshman and you expect to
win."
Mango competed at the
NCAA Championship that
year wearing knee braces. He
finished sixth in the 125-
pound tournament and
achieved his goal of earning
Ail-American honors.
This toughness symbol
ized a turning point and
resurgence in Stanford
wrestling, a dramatic turn
around fueled at least in part
by the success of a young
Ryan Mango and its effect on
a young head coach, as well as
the emergence of star
wrestler and NCAA Champi
onship runner-up Nick
Amuchastegui 'll. The in
creased expectations placed
on freshmen, spurred by the
development of that 2009 re
cruiting class Mango, Kyle
Meyer and Bret Baumbach
and the mutual learning
between player and coach are
especially evident in the 2014
team, set to be one of the best
if not the best in school his
tory.
"We came in, and we were
the worst team in the Pac-12
and we were pretty far down
there coming in my freshman
year," Meyer said. "To kind of
see the atmosphere and see
the people coming in behind
us the new recruits,
they're just getting better
and better. And it's exciting
that we started the legacy...
We're starting a new decade
of Stanford wrestling being in
the top 25, at least, and com
peting for a national champi
onship at the NCAAs."

This year's Stanford
wrestling squad marked the
convergence of two critical
groups the seniors who
had paved the way for fresh
men to excel, and the fresh
men who embraced their po
tential to help turn over a new
leaf for the program. With the
groups coming together, a dis
tinct dynamic emerged in
which the entities mutually
aided one another: While the
veterans helped ease the
freshmen's transition into the
collegiate game, the fresh
men, in turn, helped the vet
erans by bringing a new
spark to the team that quickly
became infectious and moti
vating.

"I don't think our seniors
and juniors view our fresh
men as freshmen, although
they are," Borrelli said. "They
view them as guys who can do
really well. And so when that

happens, it just brings a dif
ferent mindset to the whole
program... In just having one
or two freshmen that are hav
ing really good years, it moti
vates everybody."
"It's my fifth year here, so
I've gone through a lot of
grind," Meyer added. "Next
year, I don't have to do the
three-mile run or this work
out or really grueling stuff,
but when you look at those
[young] guys, they're really
excited, and it brings in, 'hey,
wrestling is fun and compet
ing is fun,' so it kind of helps
bring it back into perspec
tive."
Not only did the freshmen
bring with them confident and
enthusiastic mindsets, they
also brought superb talent
that made an immediate im
pact on the team. The youth
movement was led by redshirt
freshman Jim Wilson, who
finished the regular season
ranked 18th in the country in
the 165-pound weight class.
Armed with the talent to
make a big splash in the
standings, Borrelli and the
Cardinal plunged into the sea
son with confidence and ex
citement, hoping that a deep
er roster would lead them
back to national prominence.
"We set a goal at the be
ginning of the year to make
this kind of a year of firsts,"
Borrelli said. "A season of
firsts, meaning that we want
ed to win the first conference
championship, we wanted to
have the most dual meet vic
tories in a season, we wanted
to send the most individuals to
the national tournament."
After the Cardinal easily
put away dual victories over
Cal Baptist, Menlo College
and Air Force to open the sea
son before scraping past
Maryland, it pulled off a
tough road upset of then-No.
17 Michigan that Wilson iden
tified as a defining point in the
season.
"Coach Borrelli had told
us how good we could be and
we'd done all the training,"
Wilson said. "I think when we
beat Michigan, it was a real
ization. Everyone went, 'Oh,
wow. We can actually hang in
there with those guys. We can
beat those best teams.' So it
was like the first step in
everyone realizing, 'Wow, we
can actually do this.'"
Even though the Cardinal
hit its share of bumps while it
plowed through its dual
schedule, Borrelli saw the po
tential in his team and be
lieved that the team's ability
to bounce back from tough
losses displayed a maturity
and resilience demonstrative
of its mental toughness, which
was another element that set
it apart from the teams of
years past.
"We have just never fallen
too far, even when we've got
ten knocked down," Borrelli
said. "I was interested to see
how we were going to respond
[to tough losses], and we nev
er stayed down. Every time
we got knocked down, it took
us only the next match to get
back up... That's when you
know our kids' minds are
strong."
And indeed, the Cardinal
never dropped consecutive
matches while navigating it
self to a 17-5 dual meet record
to set the new school record
for dual victories in a season,
and three of its losses were
decided by less than ten
points. With wins over schools
like Michigan, Central Michi
gan and Boise State, the Car
dinal indeed showed itself —
and the nation that it could
contend with some of the best
teams in the country.

Although the Cardinal
caught a solid groove towards
the end of its season as it
rolled to eight straight dual

victories in a one-month
stretch spanning late January
and early February, it suf
fered a major setback when
senior Bret Baumbach, co
captain and defending Pac-12
title winner, suffered a knee
injury that cut his career
short and sent him to the
bench for the rest of the sea
son. With the loss of Baum
bach, the Cardinal was down
one of its stalwart corner
stones.

In the wake of such a sig
nificant loss, the Cardinal
could have folded and allowed
the forfeiture of Baumbach's
production on the mat to hin
der its progress moving into
the finale of its season.
"If Bret had pity on him
self, it would have hurt the
team," Wilson said.
But Baumbach, who had
seen and experienced the me
teoric transformation of the
program firsthand during his
five years as a Stanford
wrestler, refused to drag the
team down with him and made
the most of an unfortunate
turn of events with his leader
ship and positivity. If he could
n't make an impact on the mat,
he was going to be sure to
make an impact off of it.
"Even though he tore both
ligaments in his knee and he
was completely out, he'd come
in every day, giving every
body high-fives, telling them
how great they were going to
do, giving guys back mas
sages, trying to keep them
loose and pumping everybody
up," Wilson said. "Bret's just
such an incredible guy that he
took that injury and just
turned it into a ton of positive
energy just to try to uplift the
entire team. It was really
through Bret's example that
built everybody up."
The record-breaking sea
son, the shared perspective
and Baumbach's injury
served to unite Stanford's
squad into an inseparable
brotherhood as the Pac-12
Championship rapidly ap
proached, representing the
seniors' final chance to see
their efforts come to fruition
with the first-ever conference
championship in school histo
ry. And making the stage even
more fitting, the champi
onship was to be held at Stan

"I think to the young kids,

"But I think for our seniors,

citement, hoping that a deep
er roster would lead them
back to national prominence.
"We set a goal at the be
ginning of the year to make
this kind of a year of firsts,"
Borrelli said. "A season of
firsts, meaning that we want
ed to win the first conference
championship, we wanted to
have the most dual meet vic
tories in a season, we wanted
to send the most individuals to
the national tournament."
After the Cardinal easily
put away dual victories over
Cal Baptist, Menlo College
and Air Force to open the sea
son before scraping past
Maryland, it pulled off a
tough road upset of then-No.
17 Michigan that Wilson iden
tified as a defining point in the
season.
"Coach Borrelli had told
us how good we could be and
we'd done all the training,"
Wilson said. "I think when we
beat Michigan, it was a real
ization. Everyone went, 'Oh,
wow. We can actually hang in
there with those guys. We can
beat those best teams.' So it
was like the first step in
everyone realizing, 'Wow, we
can actually do this.'"
Even though the Cardinal
hit its share of bumps while it
plowed through its dual
schedule, Borrelli saw the po
tential in his team and be
lieved that the team's ability
to bounce back from tough
losses displayed a maturity
and resilience demonstrative
of its mental toughness, which
was another element that set
it apart from the teams of
years past.
"We have just never fallen
too far, even when we've got
ten knocked down," Borrelli
said. "I was interested to see
how we were going to respond
[to tough losses], and we nev
er stayed down. Every time
we got knocked down, it took
us only the next match to get
back up... That's when you
know our kids' minds are
strong."
And indeed, the Cardinal
never dropped consecutive
matches while navigating it
self to a 17-5 dual meet record
to set the new school record
for dual victories in a season,
and three of its losses were
decided by less than ten
points. With wins over schools
like Michigan, Central Michi
gan and Boise State, the Car
dinal indeed showed itself —
and the nation that it could
contend with some of the best
teams in the country.

Although the Cardinal
caught a solid groove towards
the end of its season as it
rolled to eight straight dual

victories in a one-month
stretch spanning late January
and early February, it suf
fered a major setback when
senior Bret Baumbach, co
captain and defending Pac-12
title winner, suffered a knee
injury that cut his career
short and sent him to the
bench for the rest of the sea
son. With the loss of Baum
bach, the Cardinal was down
one of its stalwart corner
stones.

In the wake of such a sig
nificant loss, the Cardinal
could have folded and allowed
the forfeiture of Baumbach's
production on the mat to hin
der its progress moving into
the finale of its season.
"If Bret had pity on him
self, it would have hurt the
team," Wilson said.
But Baumbach, who had
seen and experienced the me
teoric transformation of the
program firsthand during his
five years as a Stanford
wrestler, refused to drag the
team down with him and made
the most of an unfortunate
turn of events with his leader
ship and positivity. If he could
n't make an impact on the mat,
he was going to be sure to
make an impact off of it.
"Even though he tore both
ligaments in his knee and he
was completely out, he'd come
in every day, giving every
body high-fives, telling them
how great they were going to
do, giving guys back mas
sages, trying to keep them
loose and pumping everybody
up," Wilson said. "Bret's just
such an incredible guy that he
took that injury and just
turned it into a ton of positive
energy just to try to uplift the
entire team. It was really
through Bret's example that
built everybody up."
The record-breaking sea
son, the shared perspective
and Baumbach's injury
served to unite Stanford's
squad into an inseparable
brotherhood as the Pac-12
Championship rapidly ap
proached, representing the
seniors' final chance to see
their efforts come to fruition
with the first-ever conference
championship in school histo
ry. And making the stage even
more fitting, the champi
onship was to be held at Stan

ford for the first time since
2006, giving the seniors the
opportunity to make history
in front of the home crowd
that had meant so much to
them over the last five years.
"I think to the young kids,
[a conference championship]
might not mean as much be
cause they're freshmen and
sophomores, and they feel like
they have other opportunities
to win it," Borrelli added.
"But I think for our seniors,
it's really meaningful. To be at
home and have a chance to do
it here, that would mean a lot
to the guys."
In a season that Borrelli
wanted to define through
"firsts," the Cardinal had al
ready accomplished one of its
goals: It had set the new
record for most dual wins in a
season. And with both the vet
erans and younger wrestlers
in peak condition and looking
forward to wrestling in front
of them home fans, the time
seemed ripe for more history
to be made going into the Pac
-12 Championship.
But arguably, even more
significant than that was an
other first that could not nec
essarily go down in the record
books like dual wins or confer
ence championships the in
credibly strong bond and
sense of unity that the team
possessed after having navi
gated the peaks and valleys of
the season as a cohesive unit.
'Anyone would give the
shirt off his back to another
guy," Wilson said. "We trust
each other; everyone trusts
each other completely, every
one's really close. It's definite
ly just the way you would feel
about a brother. I mean, you
trust your brother, you die for
your brother, you'd do any
thing for your brother. And
that's just the way the whole
team is."

that arose from the small

Senior Dan Scherer stood
in the center of the mat with
an exhausted yet triumphant
grin, hand held high by the
referee signaling his victory
one more tally in the most
successful season in team his
tory and one final conquest in
front of the Stanford faithful.
On Sunday, that roar in
side Maples Pavilion wasn't
for a double alley-oop for
Cardinal men's basketball,
nor was it for another confer
ence title for women's basket
ball. Instead, it was in recog
nition of Stanford wrestling
a team largely overlooked
and forgotten that had faded
into relative obscurity on
campus —because on Sun
day, with the Pac-12 Champi
onships held on the Farm for
the first time since 2006, the
team capped off a regular
season in which it thundered
back to relevance, establish
ing a presence that looks to
be here to stay.

Walking into the wrestling
room in the basement of the

Arrillaga Family Sports Cen
ter two days before the Pac-12
Championship, you can feel it
in the air. No, not the hint of
stale sweat left over from tire
less weeks of preparation. You
can feel the energy, the buzz
and the camaraderie of the
group of individuals sprawled
out on the dull red mat. Look
ing around, you get the sense
that the term "group of indi
viduals" doesn't quite do jus
tice to the young men com

pletely at ease throwing
around playful banter or casu
ally practicing pinning each
other. This is a team, in every
sense of the term.

From the 5-foot-2, 125-
pound Evan Silver to the 6-
foot-1, 285-pound Josh Mar
chok, the members of this
team have forged a bond
through their combined suc
cesses and failures in a his
toric season, one in which
they are looking to capture
the first conference title in
school history after breaking
the school record for the most
dual-meet wins in a season.
For veterans like fifth-year
senior Ryan Mango, the sea
son has been a testament to
just how much the program
has improved in such a short
period of time from just
eight dual wins during the
2008-2009 season to 17 this
season.

"When I first came here,
that was really the emphasis,
even when I was being re
cruited here," Mango said.
"[Head coach Jason] Borrelli
emphasized trying to turn the
program around and being in
a program that's respected,
and really making that
change happen rather than
talking about it. So through
out the past four or five years,
we've had our ups and downs
and... it's finally paying off a
little bit this year."
Mango is one of the estab
lished leaders of the team. A
two-time Ail-American and
three-time competitor at na
tional tournaments, he is one
of the most experienced
wrestlers in the country and
will be looking to claim his
second consecutive Pac-12 ti
tle after redshirting his senior
year while moving up weight
classes from 125 pounds to
133. His 106 career wins
speak for themselves. Even
more so, it's his maturity and
perseverance outside compe
tition that have been signifi
cant to not only the team, but

also to the development of
head coach Jason Borrelli,
whose young coaching career
was profoundly affected by
Mango's actions during the
wrestler's time at Stanford.
"You'd like to think as a
coach that you're doing a lot
of teaching and coaching, but
Ryan has actually helped our
coaching staff in so many
ways," Borrelli said. "Little
things about persevering
through injuries, and for me

as a young coach who was still
trying to ... figure out the
mindset of a student-athlete,
Ryan is one of the first kids
that I remember kind of
changed the expectations that
I've put on young kids."
Mango particularly im
pacted Borrelli's mindset dur
ing his sophomore year, when
he was injured leading up to
the national tournament and
was strongly discouraged by
doctors from wrestling at the
championships after not hav
ing trained for several weeks.
But Mango just wouldn't give
in. He wanted to be an All-
American, and partially torn
ligaments weren't going to
stop him from achieving his
goal.

"I'm sitting here trying to
tell him he's not going to be
able to wrestle and he can't be
an Ail-American," Borrelli
said. "And he's telling me the
exact opposite, and I grew a
lot as a coach and I recognized
that there are kids that are
motivated at a different level
at that age. For a long time, I
thought that a kid didn't
reach that until he was much
older. And so now as a coach,
the expectation from our staff
has been, you come in as a
freshman and you expect to
win."
Mango competed at the
NCAA Championship that
year wearing knee braces. He
finished sixth in the 125-
pound tournament and
achieved his goal of earning
Ail-American honors.
This toughness symbol
ized a turning point and
resurgence in Stanford
wrestling, a dramatic turn
around fueled at least in part
by the success of a young
Ryan Mango and its effect on
a young head coach, as well as
the emergence of star
wrestler and NCAA Champi
onship runner-up Nick
Amuchastegui 'll. The in
creased expectations placed
on freshmen, spurred by the
development of that 2009 re
cruiting class Mango, Kyle
Meyer and Bret Baumbach
and the mutual learning
between player and coach are
especially evident in the 2014
team, set to be one of the best
if not the best in school his
tory.
"We came in, and we were
the worst team in the Pac-12
and we were pretty far down
there coming in my freshman
year," Meyer said. "To kind of
see the atmosphere and see
the people coming in behind
us the new recruits,
they're just getting better
and better. And it's exciting
that we started the legacy...
We're starting a new decade
of Stanford wrestling being in
the top 25, at least, and com
peting for a national champi
onship at the NCAAs."

This year's Stanford
wrestling squad marked the
convergence of two critical
groups the seniors who
had paved the way for fresh
men to excel, and the fresh
men who embraced their po
tential to help turn over a new
leaf for the program. With the
groups coming together, a dis
tinct dynamic emerged in
which the entities mutually
aided one another: While the
veterans helped ease the
freshmen's transition into the
collegiate game, the fresh
men, in turn, helped the vet
erans by bringing a new
spark to the team that quickly
became infectious and moti
vating.

"I don't think our seniors
and juniors view our fresh
men as freshmen, although
they are," Borrelli said. "They
view them as guys who can do
really well. And so when that

happens, it just brings a dif
ferent mindset to the whole
program... In just having one
or two freshmen that are hav
ing really good years, it moti
vates everybody."
"It's my fifth year here, so
I've gone through a lot of
grind," Meyer added. "Next
year, I don't have to do the
three-mile run or this work
out or really grueling stuff,
but when you look at those
[young] guys, they're really
excited, and it brings in, 'hey,
wrestling is fun and compet
ing is fun,' so it kind of helps
bring it back into perspec
tive."
Not only did the freshmen
bring with them confident and
enthusiastic mindsets, they
also brought superb talent
that made an immediate im
pact on the team. The youth
movement was led by redshirt
freshman Jim Wilson, who
finished the regular season
ranked 18th in the country in
the 165-pound weight class.
Armed with the talent to
make a big splash in the
standings, Borrelli and the
Cardinal plunged into the sea
son with confidence and ex
citement, hoping that a deep
er roster would lead them
back to national prominence.
"We set a goal at the be
ginning of the year to make
this kind of a year of firsts,"
Borrelli said. "A season of
firsts, meaning that we want
ed to win the first conference
championship, we wanted to
have the most dual meet vic

to send the most individuals to

that there are kids that are
motivated at a different level
at that age. For a long time, I
thought that a kid didn't
reach that until he was much
older. And so now as a coach,
the expectation from our staff
has been, you come in as a
freshman and you expect to
win."
Mango competed at the
NCAA Championship that
year wearing knee braces. He
finished sixth in the 125-
pound tournament and
achieved his goal of earning
Ail-American honors.
This toughness symbol
ized a turning point and
resurgence in Stanford
wrestling, a dramatic turn
around fueled at least in part
by the success of a young
Ryan Mango and its effect on
a young head coach, as well as
the emergence of star
wrestler and NCAA Champi
onship runner-up Nick
Amuchastegui 'll. The in
creased expectations placed
on freshmen, spurred by the
development of that 2009 re
cruiting class Mango, Kyle
Meyer and Bret Baumbach
and the mutual learning
between player and coach are
especially evident in the 2014
team, set to be one of the best
if not the best in school his
tory.
"We came in, and we were
the worst team in the Pac-12
and we were pretty far down
there coming in my freshman
year," Meyer said. "To kind of
see the atmosphere and see
the people coming in behind
us the new recruits,
they're just getting better
and better. And it's exciting
that we started the legacy...
We're starting a new decade
of Stanford wrestling being in
the top 25, at least, and com
peting for a national champi
onship at the NCAAs."

This year's Stanford
wrestling squad marked the
convergence of two critical
groups the seniors who
had paved the way for fresh
men to excel, and the fresh
men who embraced their po
tential to help turn over a new
leaf for the program. With the
groups coming together, a dis
tinct dynamic emerged in
which the entities mutually
aided one another: While the
veterans helped ease the
freshmen's transition into the
collegiate game, the fresh
men, in turn, helped the vet
erans by bringing a new
spark to the team that quickly
became infectious and moti
vating.

"I don't think our seniors
and juniors view our fresh
men as freshmen, although
they are," Borrelli said. "They
view them as guys who can do
really well. And so when that

happens, it just brings a dif
ferent mindset to the whole
program... In just having one
or two freshmen that are hav
ing really good years, it moti
vates everybody."
"It's my fifth year here, so
I've gone through a lot of
grind," Meyer added. "Next
year, I don't have to do the
three-mile run or this work
out or really grueling stuff,
but when you look at those
[young] guys, they're really
excited, and it brings in, 'hey,
wrestling is fun and compet
ing is fun,' so it kind of helps
bring it back into perspec
tive."
Not only did the freshmen
bring with them confident and
enthusiastic mindsets, they
also brought superb talent
that made an immediate im
pact on the team. The youth
movement was led by redshirt
freshman Jim Wilson, who
finished the regular season
ranked 18th in the country in
the 165-pound weight class.
Armed with the talent to
make a big splash in the
standings, Borrelli and the
Cardinal plunged into the sea
son with confidence and ex
citement, hoping that a deep
er roster would lead them
back to national prominence.
"We set a goal at the be
ginning of the year to make
this kind of a year of firsts,"
Borrelli said. "A season of
firsts, meaning that we want
ed to win the first conference
championship, we wanted to
have the most dual meet vic
tories in a season, we wanted
to send the most individuals to
the national tournament."
After the Cardinal easily
put away dual victories over
Cal Baptist, Menlo College
and Air Force to open the sea
son before scraping past
Maryland, it pulled off a
tough road upset of then-No.
17 Michigan that Wilson iden
tified as a defining point in the
season.
"Coach Borrelli had told
us how good we could be and
we'd done all the training,"
Wilson said. "I think when we
beat Michigan, it was a real
ization. Everyone went, 'Oh,
wow. We can actually hang in
there with those guys. We can
beat those best teams.' So it
was like the first step in
everyone realizing, 'Wow, we
can actually do this.'"
Even though the Cardinal
hit its share of bumps while it
plowed through its dual
schedule, Borrelli saw the po
tential in his team and be
lieved that the team's ability
to bounce back from tough
losses displayed a maturity
and resilience demonstrative
of its mental toughness, which
was another element that set
it apart from the teams of
years past.
"We have just never fallen
too far, even when we've got
ten knocked down," Borrelli
said. "I was interested to see
how we were going to respond
[to tough losses], and we nev
er stayed down. Every time
we got knocked down, it took
us only the next match to get
back up... That's when you
know our kids' minds are
strong."
And indeed, the Cardinal
never dropped consecutive
matches while navigating it
self to a 17-5 dual meet record
to set the new school record
for dual victories in a season,
and three of its losses were
decided by less than ten
points. With wins over schools
like Michigan, Central Michi
gan and Boise State, the Car
dinal indeed showed itself —
and the nation that it could
contend with some of the best
teams in the country.

Although the Cardinal
caught a solid groove towards
the end of its season as it
rolled to eight straight dual

victories in a one-month
stretch spanning late January
and early February, it suf
fered a major setback when
senior Bret Baumbach, co
captain and defending Pac-12
title winner, suffered a knee
injury that cut his career
short and sent him to the
bench for the rest of the sea
son. With the loss of Baum
bach, the Cardinal was down
one of its stalwart corner
stones.

In the wake of such a sig
nificant loss, the Cardinal
could have folded and allowed
the forfeiture of Baumbach's
production on the mat to hin
der its progress moving into
the finale of its season.
"If Bret had pity on him
self, it would have hurt the
team," Wilson said.
But Baumbach, who had
seen and experienced the me
teoric transformation of the
program firsthand during his
five years as a Stanford
wrestler, refused to drag the
team down with him and made
the most of an unfortunate
turn of events with his leader
ship and positivity. If he could
n't make an impact on the mat,
he was going to be sure to
make an impact off of it.
"Even though he tore both
ligaments in his knee and he
was completely out, he'd come
in every day, giving every
body high-fives, telling them
how great they were going to
do, giving guys back mas
sages, trying to keep them
loose and pumping everybody
up," Wilson said. "Bret's just
such an incredible guy that he
took that injury and just
turned it into a ton of positive
energy just to try to uplift the
entire team. It was really
through Bret's example that
built everybody up."
The record-breaking sea
son, the shared perspective
and Baumbach's injury
served to unite Stanford's
squad into an inseparable
brotherhood as the Pac-12
Championship rapidly ap
proached, representing the
seniors' final chance to see
their efforts come to fruition
with the first-ever conference
championship in school histo
ry. And making the stage even
more fitting, the champi
onship was to be held at Stan

ford for the first time since
2006, giving the seniors the
opportunity to make history
in front of the home crowd
that had meant so much to
them over the last five years.
"I think to the young kids,
[a conference championship]
might not mean as much be
cause they're freshmen and
sophomores, and they feel like
they have other opportunities
to win it," Borrelli added.
"But I think for our seniors,
it's really meaningful. To be at
home and have a chance to do
it here, that would mean a lot
to the guys."
In a season that Borrelli
wanted to define through
"firsts," the Cardinal had al
ready accomplished one of its
goals: It had set the new
record for most dual wins in a
season. And with both the vet
erans and younger wrestlers
in peak condition and looking
forward to wrestling in front
of them home fans, the time
seemed ripe for more history
to be made going into the Pac
-12 Championship.
But arguably, even more
significant than that was an
other first that could not nec
essarily go down in the record
books like dual wins or confer
ence championships the in
credibly strong bond and
sense of unity that the team
possessed after having navi
gated the peaks and valleys of
the season as a cohesive unit.
'Anyone would give the
shirt off his back to another
guy," Wilson said. "We trust
each other; everyone trusts
each other completely, every
one's really close. It's definite
ly just the way you would feel
about a brother. I mean, you
trust your brother, you die for
your brother, you'd do any
thing for your brother. And
that's just the way the whole
team is."

Senior Dan Scherer stood
in the center of the mat with
an exhausted yet triumphant
grin, hand held high by the
referee signaling his victory
one more tally in the most
successful season in team his
tory and one final conquest in
front of the Stanford faithful.
On Sunday, that roar in
side Maples Pavilion wasn't
for a double alley-oop for
Cardinal men's basketball,
nor was it for another confer
ence title for women's basket
ball. Instead, it was in recog
nition of Stanford wrestling
a team largely overlooked
and forgotten that had faded
into relative obscurity on
campus —because on Sun
day, with the Pac-12 Champi
onships held on the Farm for
the first time since 2006, the
team capped off a regular
season in which it thundered
back to relevance, establish
ing a presence that looks to
be here to stay.

Walking into the wrestling
room in the basement of the

Arrillaga Family Sports Cen
ter two days before the Pac-12
Championship, you can feel it
in the air. No, not the hint of
stale sweat left over from tire
less weeks of preparation. You
can feel the energy, the buzz
and the camaraderie of the
group of individuals sprawled
out on the dull red mat. Look
ing around, you get the sense
that the term "group of indi
viduals" doesn't quite do jus
tice to the young men com

pletely at ease throwing
around playful banter or casu
ally practicing pinning each
other. This is a team, in every
sense of the term.

From the 5-foot-2, 125-
pound Evan Silver to the 6-
foot-1, 285-pound Josh Mar
chok, the members of this
team have forged a bond
through their combined suc
cesses and failures in a his
toric season, one in which
they are looking to capture
the first conference title in
school history after breaking
the school record for the most
dual-meet wins in a season.
For veterans like fifth-year
senior Ryan Mango, the sea
son has been a testament to
just how much the program
has improved in such a short
period of time from just
eight dual wins during the
2008-2009 season to 17 this
season.

"When I first came here,
that was really the emphasis,
even when I was being re
cruited here," Mango said.
"[Head coach Jason] Borrelli
emphasized trying to turn the
program around and being in
a program that's respected,
and really making that
change happen rather than
talking about it. So through
out the past four or five years,
we've had our ups and downs
and... it's finally paying off a
little bit this year."
Mango is one of the estab
lished leaders of the team. A
two-time Ail-American and
three-time competitor at na
tional tournaments, he is one
of the most experienced
wrestlers in the country and
will be looking to claim his
second consecutive Pac-12 ti
tle after redshirting his senior
year while moving up weight
classes from 125 pounds to
133. His 106 career wins
speak for themselves. Even
more so, it's his maturity and
perseverance outside compe
tition that have been signifi
cant to not only the team, but

also to the development of
head coach Jason Borrelli,
whose young coaching career
was profoundly affected by
Mango's actions during the
wrestler's time at Stanford.
"You'd like to think as a
coach that you're doing a lot
of teaching and coaching, but
Ryan has actually helped our
coaching staff in so many
ways," Borrelli said. "Little
things about persevering
through injuries, and for me

as a young coach who was still
trying to ... figure out the
mindset of a student-athlete,
Ryan is one of the first kids
that I remember kind of
changed the expectations that
I've put on young kids."
Mango particularly im
pacted Borrelli's mindset dur
ing his sophomore year, when
he was injured leading up to
the national tournament and
was strongly discouraged by
doctors from wrestling at the
championships after not hav
ing trained for several weeks.
But Mango just wouldn't give
in. He wanted to be an All-
American, and partially torn
ligaments weren't going to
stop him from achieving his
goal.

"I'm sitting here trying to
tell him he's not going to be
able to wrestle and he can't be
an Ail-American," Borrelli
said. "And he's telling me the
exact opposite, and I grew a
lot as a coach and I recognized
that there are kids that are
motivated at a different level
at that age. For a long time, I
thought that a kid didn't
reach that until he was much
older. And so now as a coach,
the expectation from our staff
has been, you come in as a
freshman and you expect to
win."
Mango competed at the
NCAA Championship that
year wearing knee braces. He
finished sixth in the 125-
pound tournament and
achieved his goal of earning
Ail-American honors.
This toughness symbol
ized a turning point and
resurgence in Stanford
wrestling, a dramatic turn

in the air. No, not the hint of
stale sweat left over from tire
less weeks of preparation. You
can feel the energy, the buzz
and the camaraderie of the
group of individuals sprawled
out on the dull red mat. Look
ing around, you get the sense
that the term "group of indi
viduals" doesn't quite do jus
tice to the young men com

pletely at ease throwing
around playful banter or casu
ally practicing pinning each
other. This is a team, in every
sense of the term.

From the 5-foot-2, 125-
pound Evan Silver to the 6-
foot-1, 285-pound Josh Mar
chok, the members of this
team have forged a bond
through their combined suc
cesses and failures in a his
toric season, one in which
they are looking to capture
the first conference title in
school history after breaking
the school record for the most
dual-meet wins in a season.
For veterans like fifth-year
senior Ryan Mango, the sea
son has been a testament to
just how much the program
has improved in such a short
period of time from just
eight dual wins during the
2008-2009 season to 17 this
season.

"When I first came here,
that was really the emphasis,
even when I was being re
cruited here," Mango said.
"[Head coach Jason] Borrelli
emphasized trying to turn the
program around and being in
a program that's respected,
and really making that
change happen rather than
talking about it. So through
out the past four or five years,
we've had our ups and downs
and... it's finally paying off a
little bit this year."
Mango is one of the estab
lished leaders of the team. A
two-time Ail-American and
three-time competitor at na
tional tournaments, he is one
of the most experienced
wrestlers in the country and
will be looking to claim his
second consecutive Pac-12 ti
tle after redshirting his senior
year while moving up weight
classes from 125 pounds to
133. His 106 career wins
speak for themselves. Even
more so, it's his maturity and
perseverance outside compe
tition that have been signifi
cant to not only the team, but

also to the development of
head coach Jason Borrelli,
whose young coaching career
was profoundly affected by
Mango's actions during the
wrestler's time at Stanford.
"You'd like to think as a
coach that you're doing a lot
of teaching and coaching, but
Ryan has actually helped our
coaching staff in so many
ways," Borrelli said. "Little
things about persevering
through injuries, and for me

as a young coach who was still
trying to ... figure out the
mindset of a student-athlete,
Ryan is one of the first kids
that I remember kind of
changed the expectations that
I've put on young kids."
Mango particularly im
pacted Borrelli's mindset dur
ing his sophomore year, when
he was injured leading up to
the national tournament and
was strongly discouraged by
doctors from wrestling at the
championships after not hav
ing trained for several weeks.
But Mango just wouldn't give
in. He wanted to be an All-
American, and partially torn
ligaments weren't going to
stop him from achieving his
goal.

"I'm sitting here trying to
tell him he's not going to be
able to wrestle and he can't be
an Ail-American," Borrelli
said. "And he's telling me the
exact opposite, and I grew a
lot as a coach and I recognized
that there are kids that are
motivated at a different level
at that age. For a long time, I
thought that a kid didn't
reach that until he was much
older. And so now as a coach,
the expectation from our staff
has been, you come in as a
freshman and you expect to
win."
Mango competed at the
NCAA Championship that
year wearing knee braces. He
finished sixth in the 125-
pound tournament and
achieved his goal of earning
Ail-American honors.
This toughness symbol
ized a turning point and
resurgence in Stanford
wrestling, a dramatic turn
around fueled at least in part
by the success of a young
Ryan Mango and its effect on
a young head coach, as well as
the emergence of star
wrestler and NCAA Champi
onship runner-up Nick
Amuchastegui 'll. The in
creased expectations placed
on freshmen, spurred by the
development of that 2009 re
cruiting class Mango, Kyle
Meyer and Bret Baumbach
and the mutual learning
between player and coach are
especially evident in the 2014
team, set to be one of the best
if not the best in school his
tory.
"We came in, and we were
the worst team in the Pac-12
and we were pretty far down
there coming in my freshman
year," Meyer said. "To kind of
see the atmosphere and see
the people coming in behind
us the new recruits,
they're just getting better
and better. And it's exciting
that we started the legacy...
We're starting a new decade
of Stanford wrestling being in
the top 25, at least, and com
peting for a national champi
onship at the NCAAs."

This year's Stanford
wrestling squad marked the
convergence of two critical
groups the seniors who
had paved the way for fresh
men to excel, and the fresh
men who embraced their po
tential to help turn over a new
leaf for the program. With the
groups coming together, a dis
tinct dynamic emerged in
which the entities mutually
aided one another: While the
veterans helped ease the
freshmen's transition into the
collegiate game, the fresh
men, in turn, helped the vet
erans by bringing a new
spark to the team that quickly
became infectious and moti
vating.

"I don't think our seniors
and juniors view our fresh
men as freshmen, although
they are," Borrelli said. "They
view them as guys who can do
really well. And so when that

happens, it just brings a dif
ferent mindset to the whole
program... In just having one
or two freshmen that are hav
ing really good years, it moti
vates everybody."
"It's my fifth year here, so
I've gone through a lot of
grind," Meyer added. "Next
year, I don't have to do the
three-mile run or this work
out or really grueling stuff,
but when you look at those
[young] guys, they're really
excited, and it brings in, 'hey,
wrestling is fun and compet
ing is fun,' so it kind of helps
bring it back into perspec
tive."
Not only did the freshmen
bring with them confident and
enthusiastic mindsets, they
also brought superb talent
that made an immediate im
pact on the team. The youth
movement was led by redshirt
freshman Jim Wilson, who
finished the regular season
ranked 18th in the country in
the 165-pound weight class.
Armed with the talent to
make a big splash in the
standings, Borrelli and the
Cardinal plunged into the sea
son with confidence and ex
citement, hoping that a deep
er roster would lead them
back to national prominence.
"We set a goal at the be
ginning of the year to make
this kind of a year of firsts,"
Borrelli said. "A season of
firsts, meaning that we want
ed to win the first conference
championship, we wanted to
have the most dual meet vic
tories in a season, we wanted
to send the most individuals to
the national tournament."
After the Cardinal easily
put away dual victories over
Cal Baptist, Menlo College
and Air Force to open the sea
son before scraping past
Maryland, it pulled off a
tough road upset of then-No.
17 Michigan that Wilson iden
tified as a defining point in the
season.
"Coach Borrelli had told
us how good we could be and
we'd done all the training,"
Wilson said. "I think when we
beat Michigan, it was a real
ization. Everyone went, 'Oh,
wow. We can actually hang in
there with those guys. We can
beat those best teams.' So it
was like the first step in
everyone realizing, 'Wow, we
can actually do this.'"
Even though the Cardinal
hit its share of bumps while it
plowed through its dual
schedule, Borrelli saw the po
tential in his team and be
lieved that the team's ability
to bounce back from tough
losses displayed a maturity
and resilience demonstrative
of its mental toughness, which
was another element that set
it apart from the teams of
years past.
"We have just never fallen
too far, even when we've got
ten knocked down," Borrelli
said. "I was interested to see
how we were going to respond
[to tough losses], and we nev
er stayed down. Every time
we got knocked down, it took
us only the next match to get
back up... That's when you
know our kids' minds are
strong."
And indeed, the Cardinal
never dropped consecutive
matches while navigating it
self to a 17-5 dual meet record
to set the new school record
for dual victories in a season,
and three of its losses were
decided by less than ten
points. With wins over schools
like Michigan, Central Michi
gan and Boise State, the Car
dinal indeed showed itself —
and the nation that it could
contend with some of the best
teams in the country.

Although the Cardinal
caught a solid groove towards
the end of its season as it
rolled to eight straight dual

victories in a one-month
stretch spanning late January
and early February, it suf
fered a major setback when
senior Bret Baumbach, co
captain and defending Pac-12
title winner, suffered a knee
injury that cut his career
short and sent him to the
bench for the rest of the sea
son. With the loss of Baum
bach, the Cardinal was down
one of its stalwart corner
stones.

In the wake of such a sig
nificant loss, the Cardinal
could have folded and allowed
the forfeiture of Baumbach's
production on the mat to hin
der its progress moving into
the finale of its season.
"If Bret had pity on him
self, it would have hurt the
team," Wilson said.
But Baumbach, who had
seen and experienced the me
teoric transformation of the
program firsthand during his
five years as a Stanford
wrestler, refused to drag the
team down with him and made
the most of an unfortunate
turn of events with his leader
ship and positivity. If he could
n't make an impact on the mat,
he was going to be sure to
make an impact off of it.
"Even though he tore both
ligaments in his knee and he
was completely out, he'd come
in every day, giving every
body high-fives, telling them
how great they were going to
do, giving guys back mas
sages, trying to keep them
loose and pumping everybody
up," Wilson said. "Bret's just
such an incredible guy that he
took that injury and just
turned it into a ton of positive
energy just to try to uplift the
entire team. It was really
through Bret's example that
built everybody up."
The record-breaking sea
son, the shared perspective
and Baumbach's injury
served to unite Stanford's
squad into an inseparable
brotherhood as the Pac-12
Championship rapidly ap
proached, representing the
seniors' final chance to see
their efforts come to fruition
with the first-ever conference
championship in school histo
ry. And making the stage even
more fitting, the champi
onship was to be held at Stan

ford for the first time since
2006, giving the seniors the
opportunity to make history
in front of the home crowd
that had meant so much to
them over the last five years.
"I think to the young kids,
[a conference championship]
might not mean as much be
cause they're freshmen and
sophomores, and they feel like
they have other opportunities
to win it," Borrelli added.
"But I think for our seniors,
it's really meaningful. To be at
home and have a chance to do
it here, that would mean a lot
to the guys."
In a season that Borrelli
wanted to define through
"firsts," the Cardinal had al
ready accomplished one of its
goals: It had set the new
record for most dual wins in a
season. And with both the vet
erans and younger wrestlers
in peak condition and looking
forward to wrestling in front
of them home fans, the time
seemed ripe for more history
to be made going into the Pac
-12 Championship.
But arguably, even more
significant than that was an
other first that could not nec
essarily go down in the record
books like dual wins or confer
ence championships the in
credibly strong bond and
sense of unity that the team
possessed after having navi
gated the peaks and valleys of
the season as a cohesive unit.
'Anyone would give the
shirt off his back to another
guy," Wilson said. "We trust
each other; everyone trusts
each other completely, every
one's really close. It's definite
ly just the way you would feel
about a brother. I mean, you
trust your brother, you die for
your brother, you'd do any
thing for your brother. And
that's just the way the whole
team is."
