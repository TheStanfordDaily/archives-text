CC Y I Two! That's two!
I TWO! TWOOOO!" It
wasn't just the trio of
coaches who rocketed
out of then' chairs as if
their seats had suddenly become red-hot,
screaming at the tops of their lungs for
points to be awarded while pointing at the
two tangled bodies on the far side of the
black mat. It was also the pair of athletes
standing behind them coaches at the edge
of the mat, voicing their displeasure to the
referee as they jumped up and down. And
it was also the section of fans clad in cardi
nal red that bounded to its feet in unison,
yelling and gesturing, filling the vastness
of Maples Pavilion with its collective voice.
