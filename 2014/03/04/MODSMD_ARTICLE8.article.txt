## Scientists discover catalyst for more efficient methanol production 
### â€“ Kylie Jue 
Scientists from Stanford, the
SLAC National Accelerator Labo
ratory and the Technical Universi
ty of Denmark have identified a
new catalyst that converts hydro
gen and carbon dioxide to methanol
at lower pressures and with fewer
carbon monoxide byproducts.
The typical methanol plant will
turn natural gas and water into
synthesis gas carbon monoxide,
carbon dioxide and hydrogen or
"syngas." A catalyst made of cop
per, zinc and aluminum then con
verts the "syngas" into methanol,
which has uses in plastics, adhe
sives, solvents and even fuels, in a
high-pressure process.
Felix Studt, staff scientist at
SLAC National Accelerator Labo
ratory and the paper's lead author,
both tested compounds in the lab
and searched a computerized data
base for a promising new catalyst.
Using a process called computa

tional materials design, which tests
the functionality of materials based
on computer calculations, his re
search group identified nickel-galli
um as one such compound.
Co-author lb Chorkendoff's re
search group at the Technical Uni
versity of Denmark subsequently
tested the compound, and found
that the catalyst was able to pro
duce methanol both at ordinary
room pressure and also in greater
quantities at higher temperatures.
Nickel-gallium produces less car
bon monoxide byproduct than oth
er current alternatives.
In the future, the researchers
hope to make the process even
greener. Given gallium's wide use in
electronics, the catalyst also has
the potential for industrial uses. Al
though some hurdles remain, the
scientists told Science Codex that
they ultimately hope to manufac
ture methanol on a large scale
while using clean hydrogen, thus
releasing no pollutants and remain
ing carbon neutral.
The research was published in
the March 2 edition of "Nature
Chemistry."
