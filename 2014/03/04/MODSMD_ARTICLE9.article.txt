## Ogwumike shines on and off the court 
### Ashley Westhem 
Just as I sat down to write a
column about Chiney Ogwu
mike and her storied career
at Stanford, it seemed fit
ting that an email popped up
in my inbox from the women's bas
ketball Sports Information Director,
Aaron Juarez, announcing Chiney's
ninth Pac-12 Player of the Week hon
or this year the 18th of her career
on the Farm.
I probably would have been more
surprised, however, if she hadn't won
it this week. Chiney saved her best
for last, surpassing her career scor
ing record by one point on Senior
Night, when she finished with 37
points. She also won the league's first
Player of the Week honor for this
season back in November and her
dominance clearly hasn't changed a
bit as she nabbed the final honor of
the season as well.

Chiney is a phenomenal player
and the obvious frontrunner for the
Naismith National Player of the Year
award, in my opinion. Chiney's over
all game has improved markedly this
season. When I interviewed her just
before the start of the season, I was
taken aback just by the physical
strength and muscle tone she had ac
quired over summer training. She
has the perfect athlete's body to pro
pel her to success; the things that her
body can do on the court to get
around defenders, snatch rebounds
out of air, steal passes from guards al
legedly twice her speed and even
wrap the ball around her back en
route to wide-open fast-break layups
all speak for themselves.
Chiney is the epitome of a well
rounded player: she can step out and
hit the long-range jumper, she can
post up anybody, she can grab any re
bound, she can guard any player
she guarded Washington State's best
guard in Lia Galdeira on Saturday
for a bit she can thread the needle
and complete the hard passes, and
her footwork and body control are
superb.
I played basketball in high school
and grew up watching Chiney domi
nate with her sister Nneka. Being
able to meet Chiney through The
Daily, travel with her for KZSU and
actually become friends with her
over the past two seasons has been
unreal. I've seen her grow so much in
those seasons and for her to not win
National Player of the Year would be
robbing one of the hardest-working,
most perseverant, most dominant
players to have ever graced the game
of women's basketball of the highest
recognition for her accomplishments.
Last year, the race for the title
was essentially between Chiney and
Brittany Griner of Baylor. I could ac
cept that. The 6-foot-7 basketball
beast could dunk, and there's not
much one can do to compete with
that. This year, however, Chiney is
the one doing damage in the sport
and playing at the highest caliber.
Fifty points is all she needs in or
der to break former Cardinal Can
dice Wiggins' Pac-12 scoring record
of 2,629 career points. Earlier this
season, she already broke the Pac
e's all-time rebounding record.
It goes without saying that
Chiney is a phenomenal player, but
she's also a phenomenal student and
person as well. For the second
straight year, she has been deemed a
Capital One Academic AU-American.
So not only is she arguably the best
player in women's college basket
ball, she is also one of the best stu
dentsin the sport as well, and at
Stanford University no less, gradu
ating at the end of this winter quar
ter with a 3.46 GPA and a B.A. in
International Relations.
Not only does she a have a big
brain, she also has the biggest
heart that's what I admire
most about Chiney At the
postgame ceremony for Senior
Night, teammate Jasmine Camp
spoke for Ogwumike, ignoring her
talents on the court and instead fo
cusing on her talents as a person.
Jazz said that Chiney is a "ball of
light" and I couldn't agree more.
Last spring, Chiney spread that

She can post up
anybody, she can
grab any rebound,
she can guard
any player.

light in her home country of Nige
ria, where she spent a quarter ful
filling her study-abroad require
ment for International Relations
working in the Nigerian govern
ment's Ministry of Petroleum.
Chiney also spent time raising
$30,000 to build a new basketball
court for local youth through a
charity called "Access 2 Success."
She exceeded the expectations of
going to Nigeria simply for aca
demic pursuits and changed lives
with her humanitarian pursuits as
well.

I can't say enough about what
an incredible person and player
Chiney is. On Saturday, she played
her last Pac-12 regular season
game. This weekend, I will travel
with her as she tries to bring back
her fourth Pac-12 Tournament

crown after already having won the
Pac-12 title this season, and then I
will be there when she tries to
bring back to the Farm the pro
gram's first national title since
1992. I honestly can't believe that
I've had the opportunity to be a
part of such an extraordinary
team.

If you have never seen Chiney
Ogwumike in action, I highly rec
ommend you spend the last week
end of March at Maples Pavilion to
watch her play for the last time on
the Farm at the regional finals of
the NCAA tournament. Or you can
make the effort that I surely will
to see her ball it up in the WNBA
this summer.

Based on Ashley Westhem's tone,
this art icle is probably in violation<
of the NCAA's rules on improper
benefits. To tell Ashley why she is
risking Chiney's NCAA tourna
ment eligibility, contact her at

I played basketball in high school
and grew up watching Chiney domi
nate with her sister Nneka. Being
able to meet Chiney through The
Daily, travel with her for KZSU and
actually become friends with her
over the past two seasons has been
unreal. I've seen her grow so much in
those seasons and for her to not win
National Player of the Year would be
robbing one of the hardest-working,
most perseverant, most dominant
players to have ever graced the game
of women's basketball of the highest
recognition for her accomplishments.
Last year, the race for the title
was essentially between Chiney and
Brittany Griner of Baylor. I could ac
cept that. The 6-foot-7 basketball
beast could dunk, and there's not
much one can do to compete with
that. This year, however, Chiney is
the one doing damage in the sport
and playing at the highest caliber.
Fifty points is all she needs in or
der to break former Cardinal Can
dice Wiggins' Pac-12 scoring record
of 2,629 career points. Earlier this
season, she already broke the Pac
e's all-time rebounding record.
It goes without saying that
Chiney is a phenomenal player, but
she's also a phenomenal student and
person as well. For the second
straight year, she has been deemed a
Capital One Academic AU-American.
So not only is she arguably the best
player in women's college basket
ball, she is also one of the best stu
dentsin the sport as well, and at
Stanford University no less, gradu
ating at the end of this winter quar
ter with a 3.46 GPA and a B.A. in
International Relations.
Not only does she a have a big
brain, she also has the biggest
heart that's what I admire
most about Chiney At the
postgame ceremony for Senior
Night, teammate Jasmine Camp
spoke for Ogwumike, ignoring her
talents on the court and instead fo
cusing on her talents as a person.
Jazz said that Chiney is a "ball of
light" and I couldn't agree more.
Last spring, Chiney spread that

She can post up
anybody, she can
grab any rebound,
she can guard
any player.

light in her home country of Nige
ria, where she spent a quarter ful
filling her study-abroad require
ment for International Relations
working in the Nigerian govern
ment's Ministry of Petroleum.
Chiney also spent time raising
$30,000 to build a new basketball
court for local youth through a
charity called "Access 2 Success."
She exceeded the expectations of
going to Nigeria simply for aca
demic pursuits and changed lives
with her humanitarian pursuits as
well.

I can't say enough about what
an incredible person and player
Chiney is. On Saturday, she played
her last Pac-12 regular season
game. This weekend, I will travel
with her as she tries to bring back
her fourth Pac-12 Tournament

crown after already having won the
Pac-12 title this season, and then I
will be there when she tries to
bring back to the Farm the pro
gram's first national title since
1992. I honestly can't believe that
I've had the opportunity to be a
part of such an extraordinary
team.

If you have never seen Chiney
Ogwumike in action, I highly rec
ommend you spend the last week
end of March at Maples Pavilion to
watch her play for the last time on
the Farm at the regional finals of
the NCAA tournament. Or you can
make the effort that I surely will
to see her ball it up in the WNBA
this summer.

Based on Ashley Westhem's tone,
this art icle is probably in violation<
of the NCAA's rules on improper
benefits. To tell Ashley why she is
risking Chiney's NCAA tourna
ment eligibility, contact her at

Just as I sat down to write a
column about Chiney Ogwu
mike and her storied career
at Stanford, it seemed fit
ting that an email popped up
in my inbox from the women's bas
ketball Sports Information Director,
Aaron Juarez, announcing Chiney's
ninth Pac-12 Player of the Week hon
or this year the 18th of her career
on the Farm.
I probably would have been more
surprised, however, if she hadn't won
it this week. Chiney saved her best
for last, surpassing her career scor
ing record by one point on Senior
Night, when she finished with 37
points. She also won the league's first
Player of the Week honor for this
season back in November and her
dominance clearly hasn't changed a
bit as she nabbed the final honor of
the season as well.

Chiney is a phenomenal player
and the obvious frontrunner for the
Naismith National Player of the Year
award, in my opinion. Chiney's over
all game has improved markedly this
season. When I interviewed her just
before the start of the season, I was
taken aback just by the physical
strength and muscle tone she had ac
quired over summer training. She
has the perfect athlete's body to pro
pel her to success; the things that her
body can do on the court to get
around defenders, snatch rebounds
out of air, steal passes from guards al
legedly twice her speed and even
wrap the ball around her back en
route to wide-open fast-break layups
all speak for themselves.
Chiney is the epitome of a well
rounded player: she can step out and
hit the long-range jumper, she can
post up anybody, she can grab any re
bound, she can guard any player
she guarded Washington State's best
guard in Lia Galdeira on Saturday
for a bit she can thread the needle
and complete the hard passes, and
her footwork and body control are
superb.
