Public policy making in the United States is part of a political
process that can take years or even decades to play out. A familiarity with
the politics of policy making is key to understanding why some reform
attempts are successful while others are not. Join course instructor Lanhee
Chen, Mitt Romney's campaign policy director and a senior official in the
George W. Bush Administration, in a behind-the-scenes look at how policy
| actually gets made. Students will gain exposure to the theory and literature
behind policy formulation, and engage in debates over historical and
contemporary efforts at reform.
