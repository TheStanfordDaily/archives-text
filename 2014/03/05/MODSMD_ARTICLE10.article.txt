# BUFFALO BATTLE
## 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
Despite a sweep at the hands of
the Arizona schools last week, the
Stanford men's basketball team
still is within reach of its ultimate
goal for the season: making the

NCAA tournament. With the Car
dinal (18-10, 9-7 Pac-12) currently
projected to be somewhere be
tween an 8 seed and a 10 seed by
the likes of ESPN, CBS, team
rankings.com and USA Today, it is
crucial that Stanford does not give
the tournament committee area

son to bump it out of the field of 68.
Holding serve this week at home
in the final games of the regular
season against Colorado (20-9,9-7)
and Utah (19-9, 8-8) would pretty
much guarantee the Cardinal a
spot in the Big Dance.
If the Cardinal is going to have
success tonight against the Buf
faloes, it needs to turn itself
around quickly. Stanford dropped
consecutive games last week for
the first time since the first week
of January, when the Cardinal
reached its low point of the season
following a home loss to Cal and a
road loss to Oregon State. It was
not just that Stanford lost its two
games last week, but it was the
way in which it lost them.
Stanford was hardly competi
tive against both Arizona and Ari
zona State, dooming itself with
turnover-plagued starts in each
game. As a result, the Cardinal fell
behind early against two good
teams and never found its way

GAME NOTES: Stanford will look to con
solidate its projected NCAA Tourna

in the Pac-12 Tournament as it wel
comes Colorado, another upper-tier
Pac-12 team looking to strengthen its
tournament resume, for the penulti

Senior forward Josh Huestis (above) is averaging 16 points, 11 rebounds
and 3 blocks per game over his last four games. He will
look to continue his hot streak tonight at home against Colorado.

back into the games a rari

The 12-point loss to ASU and
the 13-point loss to Arizona
were Stanford's worst mar
gins of defeat since a 17-point
loss to UCLA back on Jan.
23. The Cardinal was a far
cry from the competitive out
let that came within three
points of sweeping the Ari
zona schools at Maples Pavil
ion a month ago.
Despite the poor team

play, seniors Josh Huestis
and Anthony Brown contin
ued their recently strong
form this past week with sol
id outings. Huestis averaged
16.5 points and 10.0 rebounds
during the road swing, in
cluding a 22-point, 12-re
bound outburst against the
Wildcats. The Great Falls,
Mont., native is averaging 16
points, 11 rebounds and 3
blocks per game over his last
four games, and it is safe to
say that he is playing the best
basketball of his Stanford ca
reer at the right time.
Meanwhile, Brown contin
ues to prove that he is one of
the best shooters in the con

ference, if not the nation, with
a road trip that saw him aver
age 17.5 points on 68.8 per
cent shooting, including 55.6
percent from 3-point range.
Brown is now shooting better
than 50 percent for the sea
son and ranks 15th in the
country in 3-point field goal
percentage at 48.5 percent.
A lack of good ball move
ment on offense was what
held Stanford back last week,
as the Cardinal managed just
a combined 12 assists over
the two games, in comparison
to 25 turnovers.
If there's good news for
Stanford, it's that the Cardi
nal has returned home, a

place where the team has
recorded an 11-3 record, as
opposed to a 6-5 record on the
road.
Against the Buffaloes,
Stanford will have to do a
good job on the glass if it
wants to come away with the
victory. Colorado ranks as the
second-best rebounding team
in the conference behind only
Arizona, with a plus-6.4 per
game margin.
First and foremost, that
means boxing out sophomore
forward Josh Scott, who has
emerged as the team's best
player following the season
ending injury to junior guard
and All-Pac-12 performer

Spencer Dinwiddie. Scott is
averaging 14.6 points and 8.7
rebounds per game this sea
son, which means that Stan
ford's big-man trio of Huestis
and fellow seniors Dwight
Powell and Stefan Nastic
should have then- hands full
all night long.

Colorado's other standout
to keep an eye on is junior
guard Askia Booker, who is
averaging 14 points, 3.5 re
bounds, 3.5 assists and 1.5
steals per game this season.
As good as those numbers
are, Booker has only gotten
better in conference play
averaging 15.2 points, 4.8 as
sists and 1.7 steals during the

Pac-12 season.
With players such as Scott
and Booker, Colorado is cer
tainly a dangerous team that
also happens to be fighting
for its postseason life. That
said, the Buffaloes are just 6-
7 in Dinwiddie's absence, in
cluding a 1-4 mark on the
road. Make no bones about it
this is a game that Stan
ford must have if it is to avoid
an NIT fate for the third con
secutive season.
Tipoff tonight is set for 6
p.m., and the game will be tel
evised nationally on ESPN2.

Despite a sweep at the hands of
the Arizona schools last week, the
Stanford men's basketball team
still is within reach of its ultimate
goal for the season: making the

NCAA tournament. With the Car
dinal (18-10, 9-7 Pac-12) currently
projected to be somewhere be
tween an 8 seed and a 10 seed by
the likes of ESPN, CBS, team
rankings.com and USA Today, it is
crucial that Stanford does not give
the tournament committee area

son to bump it out of the field of 68.
Holding serve this week at home
in the final games of the regular
season against Colorado (20-9,9-7)
and Utah (19-9, 8-8) would pretty
much guarantee the Cardinal a
spot in the Big Dance.
If the Cardinal is going to have
success tonight against the Buf
faloes, it needs to turn itself
around quickly. Stanford dropped
consecutive games last week for
the first time since the first week
of January, when the Cardinal
reached its low point of the season
following a home loss to Cal and a
road loss to Oregon State. It was
not just that Stanford lost its two
games last week, but it was the
way in which it lost them.
Stanford was hardly competi
tive against both Arizona and Ari
zona State, dooming itself with
turnover-plagued starts in each
game. As a result, the Cardinal fell
behind early against two good
teams and never found its way

GAME NOTES: Stanford will look to con

Senior forward Josh Huestis (above) is averaging 16 points, 11 rebounds
and 3 blocks per game over his last four games. He will
look to continue his hot streak tonight at home against Colorado.

The 12-point loss to ASU and
the 13-point loss to Arizona
were Stanford's worst mar
gins of defeat since a 17-point
loss to UCLA back on Jan.
23. The Cardinal was a far
cry from the competitive out
let that came within three
points of sweeping the Ari
zona schools at Maples Pavil
ion a month ago.
Despite the poor team

play, seniors Josh Huestis
and Anthony Brown contin
ued their recently strong
form this past week with sol
id outings. Huestis averaged
16.5 points and 10.0 rebounds
during the road swing, in
cluding a 22-point, 12-re
bound outburst against the
Wildcats. The Great Falls,
Mont., native is averaging 16
points, 11 rebounds and 3
blocks per game over his last
four games, and it is safe to
say that he is playing the best
basketball of his Stanford ca
reer at the right time.
Meanwhile, Brown contin
ues to prove that he is one of
the best shooters in the con

ference, if not the nation, with
a road trip that saw him aver
age 17.5 points on 68.8 per
cent shooting, including 55.6
percent from 3-point range.
Brown is now shooting better
than 50 percent for the sea
son and ranks 15th in the
country in 3-point field goal
percentage at 48.5 percent.
A lack of good ball move
ment on offense was what
held Stanford back last week,
as the Cardinal managed just
a combined 12 assists over
the two games, in comparison
to 25 turnovers.
If there's good news for
Stanford, it's that the Cardi
nal has returned home, a

place where the team has
recorded an 11-3 record, as
opposed to a 6-5 record on the
road.
Against the Buffaloes,
Stanford will have to do a
good job on the glass if it
wants to come away with the
victory. Colorado ranks as the
second-best rebounding team
in the conference behind only
Arizona, with a plus-6.4 per
game margin.
First and foremost, that
means boxing out sophomore
forward Josh Scott, who has
emerged as the team's best
player following the season
ending injury to junior guard
and All-Pac-12 performer

Spencer Dinwiddie. Scott is
averaging 14.6 points and 8.7
rebounds per game this sea
son, which means that Stan
ford's big-man trio of Huestis
and fellow seniors Dwight
Powell and Stefan Nastic
should have then- hands full
all night long.

Colorado's other standout
to keep an eye on is junior
guard Askia Booker, who is
averaging 14 points, 3.5 re
bounds, 3.5 assists and 1.5
steals per game this season.
As good as those numbers
are, Booker has only gotten
better in conference play
averaging 15.2 points, 4.8 as
sists and 1.7 steals during the

Pac-12 season.
With players such as Scott
and Booker, Colorado is cer
tainly a dangerous team that
also happens to be fighting
for its postseason life. That
said, the Buffaloes are just 6-
7 in Dinwiddie's absence, in
cluding a 1-4 mark on the
road. Make no bones about it
