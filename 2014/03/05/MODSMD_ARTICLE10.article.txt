# BUFFALO BATTLE

### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
Despite a sweep at the hands of
the Arizona schools last week, the
Stanford men's basketball team
still is within reach of its ultimate
goal for the season: making the

NCAA tournament. With the Car
dinal (18-10, 9-7 Pac-12) currently
projected to be somewhere be
tween an 8 seed and a 10 seed by
the likes of ESPN, CBS, team
rankings.com and USA Today, it is
crucial that Stanford does not give
the tournament committee area

son to bump it out of the field of 68.
Holding serve this week at home
in the final games of the regular
season against Colorado (20-9,9-7)
and Utah (19-9, 8-8) would pretty
much guarantee the Cardinal a
spot in the Big Dance.
If the Cardinal is going to have
success tonight against the Buf
faloes, it needs to turn itself
around quickly. Stanford dropped
consecutive games last week for
the first time since the first week
of January, when the Cardinal
reached its low point of the season
following a home loss to Cal and a
road loss to Oregon State. It was
not just that Stanford lost its two
games last week, but it was the
way in which it lost them.
Stanford was hardly competi
tive against both Arizona and Ari
zona State, dooming itself with
turnover-plagued starts in each
game. As a result, the Cardinal fell
behind early against two good
teams and never found its way

GAME NOTES: Stanford will look to con
solidate its projected NCAA Tourna
ment berth and earn a first-round bye
in the Pac-12 Tournament as it wel
comes Colorado, another upper-tier
Pac-12 team looking to strengthen its
tournament resume, for the penulti
mate game of its regular season. The
Card will close the season against
Utah on Saturday.

and 3 blocks per game over his last four games. He will
look to continue his hot streak tonight at home against Colorado.
