## MARQUESS WINS 1,500th 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
The wait may have been a little
longer than desired, but the mile
stone victory was just as sweet
nonetheless. Stanford baseball
head coach Mark Marquess
clinched his 1,500 th career victory,
becoming just the seventh coach
in the history of collegiate baseball
to reach the milestone, in an 11-1
victory over rival California in
Berkeley.

After going nearly silent on
the wrong side of a weekend
sweep at Vanderbilt, the Stanford
bats exploded for 11 runs as the
Cardinal (5-7) cruised to a con
vincing victory over Cal (8-3).
Powered by junior third baseman
Alex Blandino, who went 3-for-3
with four RBIs, Stanford finished
with 12 hits spread out among
seven different Cardinal hitters
to bring home Marquess' momen
tous victory in the team's fourth
try at it.

"We needed to play well and
we played well," Marquess said.
"We threw it over the plate and we
made some plays. We made some
mistakes but we also swung the
bat."

3/4, Berkeley, Calif.
The fireworks began in
the top of the first inning for
the Cardinal, as Blandino and
sophomore Austin Barr both
doubled runners home to put
the Cardinal up 2-0. Barr,
starting in only his fifth game
of the season, finished 2-for-4
on the day, later adding an
other double in the third in
ning.
In the top of the third in
ning, Blandino again trig
gered the offense with a two
run single. Stanford would
plate five total runs in the in
ning, with an RBI triple from
sophomore Zach Hoffpauir
and an RBI single from soph
omore Drew Jackson bring
ing home more runs, to in

crease the lead to 7-0. The
Cardinal continued its domi
nance at the plate with three
more runs in the fourth and
fifth innings combined to ex
tend the lead to 10-0, includ
ing another RBI single from
Blandino. A bases-loaded
walk from freshman Tommy
Edman in the seventh inning
scored the 11th and final run.
Along with Blandino and
Barr, senior Brett Michael
Doran and sophomore Zach
Hoffpauir both finished with
multi-hit games, recording
two hits apiece and also scor
ing two runs each.
The 11 runs and 12 hits
for the Cardinal followed a
three-game series at Vander
bilt that saw Stanford record
just four combined runs and
14 hits. The bats responded
in dramatic fashion with the
win over Cal, which had
started the season impres

sively with an 8-2 record pri
or to Tuesday's 11-1 defeat.
Freshman pitcher Tyler
Thorne started on the mound
for the Cardinal in his second
start of the season. Thorne
allowed only three hits in five
innings of work to pick up his
second win of the season and
improve his ERA to 1.88.
Sophomore Daniel Starwalt,
junior John Hochstatter and
senior A. J. Vanegas pitched in
relief of Thorne. Starwalt al
lowed a solo home run in the
sixth inning to Cal senior Ja
cob Wark in an inning of relief
that provided Cal with its on
ly run of the game. Hochstat
ter pitched scoreless seventh
and eighth innings before
Vanegas pitched a 1-2-3 ninth
inning in his third appearance
of the season.
Marquess, in his 38th year
coaching the Cardinal, is now
only the third active coach
with 1,500 career wins, join
ing Texas' Augie Garrido and
Florida State's Mike Martin.
In a time when coaches
change schools increasingly
often, Marquess has re
mained with Stanford for his
entire career. He is 1,500-
788-7 as Stanford's head
coach and has led the Cardi
nal to two national champi
onships.
"I'm very proud of the
fact that I was able to play at
Stanford and coach here my
whole career," Marquess
said.
Stanford returns home to
Sunken Diamond this week
end to take on Kansas in a
three-game series. Play be
gins on Friday with the first
pitch scheduled for 6 p.m.

Junior Alex Blandino (above) went 3-for-3 with a double
and 4 RBIs in Stanford's 11-1 romp over Cal on Tuesday.
He's hitting .429/.500/.619 with 12 RBIs on the season.
The wait may have been a little
longer than desired, but the mile
stone victory was just as sweet
nonetheless. Stanford baseball
head coach Mark Marquess
clinched his 1,500 th career victory,
becoming just the seventh coach
in the history of collegiate baseball
to reach the milestone, in an 11-1
victory over rival California in
Berkeley.

After going nearly silent on
the wrong side of a weekend
sweep at Vanderbilt, the Stanford
bats exploded for 11 runs as the
Cardinal (5-7) cruised to a con
vincing victory over Cal (8-3).
Powered by junior third baseman
Alex Blandino, who went 3-for-3
with four RBIs, Stanford finished
with 12 hits spread out among
seven different Cardinal hitters
to bring home Marquess' momen
tous victory in the team's fourth
try at it.

"We needed to play well and
we played well," Marquess said.
"We threw it over the plate and we
made some plays. We made some
mistakes but we also swung the
bat."

3/4, Berkeley, Calif.
The fireworks began in
the top of the first inning for
the Cardinal, as Blandino and
sophomore Austin Barr both
doubled runners home to put
the Cardinal up 2-0. Barr,
starting in only his fifth game
of the season, finished 2-for-4
on the day, later adding an
other double in the third in
ning.
In the top of the third in
ning, Blandino again trig
gered the offense with a two
run single. Stanford would
plate five total runs in the in
ning, with an RBI triple from
sophomore Zach Hoffpauir
and an RBI single from soph
omore Drew Jackson bring
ing home more runs, to in

crease the lead to 7-0. The
Cardinal continued its domi
nance at the plate with three
more runs in the fourth and
fifth innings combined to ex
tend the lead to 10-0, includ
ing another RBI single from
Blandino. A bases-loaded
walk from freshman Tommy
Edman in the seventh inning
scored the 11th and final run.
Along with Blandino and
Barr, senior Brett Michael
Doran and sophomore Zach
Hoffpauir both finished with
multi-hit games, recording
two hits apiece and also scor
ing two runs each.
The 11 runs and 12 hits
for the Cardinal followed a
three-game series at Vander
bilt that saw Stanford record
just four combined runs and
14 hits. The bats responded
in dramatic fashion with the
win over Cal, which had
started the season impres

sively with an 8-2 record pri
or to Tuesday's 11-1 defeat.
Freshman pitcher Tyler
Thorne started on the mound
for the Cardinal in his second
start of the season. Thorne
allowed only three hits in five
innings of work to pick up his
second win of the season and
improve his ERA to 1.88.
Sophomore Daniel Starwalt,
junior John Hochstatter and
senior A. J. Vanegas pitched in
relief of Thorne. Starwalt al
lowed a solo home run in the
sixth inning to Cal senior Ja
cob Wark in an inning of relief
that provided Cal with its on
ly run of the game. Hochstat
ter pitched scoreless seventh
and eighth innings before
Vanegas pitched a 1-2-3 ninth
