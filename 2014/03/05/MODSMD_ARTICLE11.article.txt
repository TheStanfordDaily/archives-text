## MARQUESS WINS 1,500th 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
The wait may have been a little
longer than desired, but the mile
stone victory was just as sweet
nonetheless. Stanford baseball
head coach Mark Marquess
clinched his 1,500 th career victory,
becoming just the seventh coach
in the history of collegiate baseball
to reach the milestone, in an 11-1
victory over rival California in
Berkeley.

After going nearly silent on
the wrong side of a weekend
sweep at Vanderbilt, the Stanford
bats exploded for 11 runs as the
Cardinal (5-7) cruised to a con
vincing victory over Cal (8-3).
Powered by junior third baseman
Alex Blandino, who went 3-for-3
with four RBIs, Stanford finished
with 12 hits spread out among
seven different Cardinal hitters
to bring home Marquess' momen
tous victory in the team's fourth
try at it.

"We needed to play well and
we played well," Marquess said.
"We threw it over the plate and we
made some plays. We made some
mistakes but we also swung the
bat."
