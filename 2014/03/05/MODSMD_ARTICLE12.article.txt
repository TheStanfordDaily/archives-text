## SEEING GREEN Roundup unready 
### Holly Moeller 
~T~T Thy is that man dressed
\/\/ like an astronaut,
V V Dad?"
I must have been 10 or so when
I asked that question from the back
seat of the car while my parents
drove by a golf course. The seem
ing astronaut was a groundskeeper,
dressed from head to toe in a white
hazmat suit, waving a metal wand
back and forth over the ground as
he walked the edge of the putting
green.
My dad explained that he was
probably spraying toxic chemicals
to kill weeds that the golfers did not
want on the course. Because he was
working with concentrated levels of
the herbicides, he needed special
clothing to protect himself.
"It's bad stuff, Holly. Really
dangerous chemicals," said Dad,
who'd grown up reading Rachel
Carson's accounts of the devasta
tion wrought by DDT.
The man on the golf course was
using pesticides for cosmetic rea
sons, but elsewhere they have be
come a staple of our daily lives.
Every summer, the suburban
homes in my neighborhood pep
pered their lawns with little white
flags warning dogs and children to
"Keep Off." More importantly, pes
ticides are used throughout our
agricultural system to ensure con
sistent, high yields: Herbicides
beat back the weeds that compete
with our crops, and insecticides kill
off the bugs that might nibble on
food destined for our table. The
vast increases in crop yields
achieved by the "Green Revolu
tion" of the 20th century were
made possible in part by similarly
vast uses of agricultural pesticides.
But when Carson publicly
broached the topic of these chemi
cals' dangers, and as evidence
mounted linking pesticides to envi
ronmental and human health risks,
scientists started to wonder which
chemical cures were worth their
side effects.

No wonder glyphosate —or
Roundup, as it's known commer
cially took the market by storm
when its herbicide properties were
discovered by a Monsanto Compa
ny scientist in 1970. Not only is it
strikingly effective at knocking
back fast-growing weeds, but it
supposedly breaks down rapidly in
nature, leaving freshly treated sur
faces fit for play in a matter of days
and limiting exposure to the chemi
cal for those who nibble on fresh
picked fruits and veggies.
By 1996 (read: four years before
its Roundup patent expired in the
United States), Monsanto was mar
keting "Roundup Ready" crops.
The seed line which today in
cludes soybeans, canola, corn, cot
ton and alfalfa produces fields
full of glyphosate-resistant plants.
This allows farmers to liberally
spray down their entire fields,
killing off annoying weeds without
damaging their crops.
Predictably, with the advent of
this new technology, use of
Roundup soared. Today, more than
180 million pounds of the herbicide
are applied to American farms each
year. And Monsanto continues to
see double-digit growth in the busi
ness sectors that feature Roundup
pesticide and Roundup Ready
crops.
But all is not rainbows and but
terflies when it comes to Roundup.
Particularly not butterflies, says
the National Resources Defense
Council (NRDC), which petitioned
the Environmental Protection
Agency for better regulation of
glyphosate late last month. The
NRDC points out that the wide
spread use of glyphosate kills off
many important native plants, in
cluding the milkweed that feeds the
most charismatic of North Ameri
can butterflies: the monarch. The
striking black-and-orange butter
flies that migrate through Ameri
ca's agricultural heartland each
year have declined by 80 percent in
some regions, in part due to loss of
habitat and food supply. And since
the EPA hasn't issued new regula
tions on glyphosate use since 1993
before the advent of Roundup
Ready crops the NRDC thinks it
had better do so before monarchs
are gone for good.
(While the EPA is at it, the Food
and Drug Administration might al
so consider starting testing for
glyphosate residues: Apparently
the commonly-used pesticide isn't a
part of the Pesticide Residue Moni
toring Program!)
Perhaps more importantly than
the survival of a pretty but ar
guably expendable butterfly,
though, we also have to face the fact
that glyphosate won't work forever.
Under the intense natural selection
pressure of heavy glyphosate us

age, just four years after Roundup
Ready crops were introduced,
glyphosate resistance was reported
in weeds. The promise of
glyphosate is, therefore, short
lived: As these resistant competi
tors grow in diversity and abun
dance, farmers will be forced to
turn to different and potentially
even more dangerous means of de
fense.
What does it mean to live by
chemical warfare —in an arms
race against evolution that, even
now, we know we are losing?
Monsanto knows the answer:
Quick profits. It managed to adapt
with Roundup, but with no real in
centive beyond the lifetime of its
patents, the company's motivation
is to exploit new technology quickly
before moving on to the next tem
porary solution. And while it's easy
to vilify the successful corporate gi
ant, our economic system for all
its commendable ability to stimu
late innovation has really pro
vided the selection pressure that al
lowed the Monsantos of the world
to evolve.
Quite frankly, with no built-in
economic consequences for envi
ronmental degradation, as well as
absent effective regulations on
chemical products, it's easy for
companies to sweep through the
market with quick "fixes" that
might just do more harm than
good.
That's why it's important to pay
attention to what watchdog groups
and environmental advocates (and
even the occasional tree hugger)
have to say. One can only hope that,
when prodded, the EPA and other
regulatory agencies will step up to
the task of evaluating scientific evi
dence and putting the proper regu
lations into place.
