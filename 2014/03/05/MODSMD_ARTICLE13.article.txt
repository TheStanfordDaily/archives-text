## Tar sands, arrests and a movement: Fossil Free Stanford on the Keystone XL pipeline 
### Michael Penuelas Yari Greaney 
On Sunday morning, 398 pairs
of hands thrust through the
White House fence and bound
themselves with white plastic zip
ties to the iron bars in an act of
peaceful defiance against the Key
stone XL Pipeline. The protesters
were all arrested in the largest act
of youth-specific civil disobedience
in decades.
On Monday morning, a group of
15 Stanford students took the 7:23
a.m. Caltrain into San Francisco for
a student-led solidarity action,
dubbed XL Dissent West Coast.
Joining a crowd of more than 75 stu
dents from around the Bay Area
and intentionally risking arrest,
they rallied alongside dozens at the
San Francisco State Department
Building. They were demonstrating
public solidarity with those 398 ar
rested Sunday protesting the
pipeline in our nation's capital. Nine
were ultimately arrested.
The pipeline that students across
the country were protesting would
bring crude tar sands oil from Al
berta, Canada, through the U.S. to
Texas for export. The final decision
on whether it will be built comes
down to the President and is expect
ed in late spring.
Here is what will happen if Pres
ident Obama approves the Keystone
XL Pipeline:
First, the sole freshwater source
for two million Americans and 30
percent of the nation's groundwater
used for irrigation are at risk of con
tamination if there were to be a spill.
TransCanada has stated that their
Keystone pipelines are the safest on
the continent, and yet their Key
stone One pipeline suffered more
spills in its first year (2010-2011)
than any other first-year pipeline in
U.S. history, with twelve spills.

Second, according to the State
Department's Environmental Im
pact Statement, the tar sands oil will
be some of the dirtiest, most carbon
intensive oil ever produced on a
large scale. Its extraction and re
finement alone will result in 12 to 23
million metric tons of greenhouse
gas emissions annually. This is in ad
dition to combustion of the tar sands
oil, making the life cycle emissions
of the pipeline roughly 5.3 billion
metric tons of carbon dioxide.
Third, it does stunningly little to
increase our energy independence.
The Keystone XL is an export
pipeline. The tar sands oil will come
out of the ground in Canada, flow in
pipes across our country's heartland
(risking our land, air and water in
the transportation process) and ulti
mately wind up loaded onto tankers
for export to China, Latin America
and Europe. In fact, the initial per-

Mit application filed by TransCana
da explicitly states that this in
creased access to overseas markets
will divert the oil Canada currently
produces for America to send it
overseas, increasing gas prices for
those in the American Midwest and
particularly for our farmers.
In a congressional healing, Tran
sCanada's President claimed that
the pipeline will create 20,000 Amer
ican jobs. The State Department in
dicates that the number will be clos
er to 5,000. Moreover, it turns out
only 35 of those jobs would last more
than three years, and only 10 per
cent of any of the positions would be
filled by local workers.
The Keystone drama is the
same story we've seen replayed
for decades on stages of all sizes.
Time and time again, the fossil

protest the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which would transport tar
sands oil from Canada to energy shipping terminals in the Gulf.
