## Tar sands, arrests and a movement: Fossil Free Stanford on the Keystone XL pipeline 
### Michael Penuelas Yari Greaney 
On Sunday morning, 398 pairs
of hands thrust through the
White House fence and bound
themselves with white plastic zip
ties to the iron bars in an act of
peaceful defiance against the Key
stone XL Pipeline. The protesters
were all arrested in the largest act
of youth-specific civil disobedience
in decades.
On Monday morning, a group of
15 Stanford students took the 7:23
a.m. Caltrain into San Francisco for
a student-led solidarity action,
dubbed XL Dissent West Coast.
Joining a crowd of more than 75 stu
dents from around the Bay Area
and intentionally risking arrest,
they rallied alongside dozens at the
San Francisco State Department
Building. They were demonstrating
public solidarity with those 398 ar
rested Sunday protesting the
pipeline in our nation's capital. Nine
were ultimately arrested.
The pipeline that students across
the country were protesting would
bring crude tar sands oil from Al
berta, Canada, through the U.S. to
Texas for export. The final decision
on whether it will be built comes
down to the President and is expect
ed in late spring.
Here is what will happen if Pres
ident Obama approves the Keystone
XL Pipeline:
First, the sole freshwater source
for two million Americans and 30
percent of the nation's groundwater
used for irrigation are at risk of con
tamination if there were to be a spill.
TransCanada has stated that their
Keystone pipelines are the safest on
the continent, and yet their Key
stone One pipeline suffered more
spills in its first year (2010-2011)
than any other first-year pipeline in
U.S. history, with twelve spills.

Second, according to the State
Department's Environmental Im
pact Statement, the tar sands oil will
be some of the dirtiest, most carbon
intensive oil ever produced on a
large scale. Its extraction and re
finement alone will result in 12 to 23
million metric tons of greenhouse
gas emissions annually. This is in ad
dition to combustion of the tar sands
oil, making the life cycle emissions
of the pipeline roughly 5.3 billion
metric tons of carbon dioxide.
Third, it does stunningly little to
increase our energy independence.
The Keystone XL is an export
pipeline. The tar sands oil will come
out of the ground in Canada, flow in
pipes across our country's heartland
(risking our land, air and water in
the transportation process) and ulti
mately wind up loaded onto tankers
for export to China, Latin America
and Europe. In fact, the initial per-

Mit application filed by TransCana
da explicitly states that this in
creased access to overseas markets
will divert the oil Canada currently
produces for America to send it
overseas, increasing gas prices for
those in the American Midwest and
particularly for our farmers.
In a congressional healing, Tran
sCanada's President claimed that
the pipeline will create 20,000 Amer
ican jobs. The State Department in
dicates that the number will be clos
er to 5,000. Moreover, it turns out
only 35 of those jobs would last more
than three years, and only 10 per
cent of any of the positions would be
filled by local workers.
The Keystone drama is the
same story we've seen replayed
for decades on stages of all sizes.

fuel industry has shameless
ly demanded that our nation
and our world backpedal on
climate policy and emission
regulations. What has galva
nized the nation to act so pur
posefully upon this particular
environmental threat is that
approval of the Keystone XL
Pipeline would make a bla
tantly backward and reac
tionary statement. While the
world has repeatedly agreed
that we desperately need to
take serious steps toward a
safer climate, we as a na
tion are not taking those
steps.
Instead, we continue to
build an energy infrastruc
ture predicated upon contin
ued use of not just fossil fuels,
but extremely dirty forms of
fossil fuels. It's unceasingly
frustrating that we as stu
dents, professors, universi
ties, communities and even
nations are still forced to en
gage in this contrived, tired
argument. It makes us wist
ful for a future where we in
stead debate the pros and

cons of rows of wind turbines
meandering through our
states. Keystone One has had
far too many problems, and
we are ready to be done with
debates over fat, leaky pipes
bursting with dirty crude oil.
The educated youth who
grew up in the midst of cli
mate controversies, climate
calamities and now more
than ever, climate solutions,
are speaking up. The largest
coordinated climate move
ment in history is thriving on
campuses across the nation,
and momentum, stymied for
so long by the fossil fuel in
dustry, is building. We are ab
solutely convinced that this is
and must be the movement
that will carry us to definitive
climate action.

Frustrated by the extent
of the fossil fuel industry's
disproportionate power and
the resulting inaction of our
policymakers, a new ap
proach has arisen. Most of
the students who traveled on
Monday from Stanford to
San Francisco for the XL
Dissent West Coast rally are
members of Fossil Free Stan
ford, the student group work
ing to divest Stanford's en
dowment from fossil fuels. If
we cannot stop Keystone

from being built directly, we
can affect the demand for
projects like Keystone. Stan
ford making the choice to re
ject fossil fuels would be a
massive step in the right di
rection.

This approach has given
the youth of the nation a cli
mate goal they can reach a
means by which they can
leverage the power of institu
tions to finally create the po
litical, social and economic
space for renewables to join
them on the scene. Through
coordinated, nationwide ac
tion we are building a coun
try where we needn't worry
over tar sands pipelines. In
stead, let's focus our efforts
upon creating an energy-in
dependent America that pro
tects the well-being of not on
ly U.S. citizens but citizens of
the world.

nations are still forced to en
gage in this contrived, tired
argument. It makes us wist
ful for a future where we in

cons of rows of wind turbines

states. Keystone One has had
far too many problems, and
we are ready to be done with
debates over fat, leaky pipes

The educated youth who

are speaking up. The largest

solutely convinced that this is
and must be the movement
that will carry us to definitive

Frustrated by the extent

the students who traveled on
Monday from Stanford to

Dissent West Coast rally are
members of Fossil Free Stan
ford, the student group work
ing to divest Stanford's en
dowment from fossil fuels. If
we cannot stop Keystone

from being built directly, we
can affect the demand for
projects like Keystone. Stan
ford making the choice to re

massive step in the right di

This approach has given
the youth of the nation a cli

means by which they can
leverage the power of institu

litical, social and economic
space for renewables to join
them on the scene. Through
coordinated, nationwide ac
tion we are building a coun
try where we needn't worry
over tar sands pipelines. In
stead, let's focus our efforts
upon creating an energy-in
dependent America that pro
tects the well-being of not on
ly U.S. citizens but citizens of
the world.

The student-led protest in San Francisco rallied in support of the Washington, D.C., protest
the previous day. Nine students were arrested in San Francisco; 398 were jailed in D.C.
On Sunday morning, 398 pairs
of hands thrust through the
White House fence and bound
themselves with white plastic zip
ties to the iron bars in an act of
peaceful defiance against the Key
stone XL Pipeline. The protesters
were all arrested in the largest act
of youth-specific civil disobedience
in decades.
On Monday morning, a group of
15 Stanford students took the 7:23
a.m. Caltrain into San Francisco for
a student-led solidarity action,
dubbed XL Dissent West Coast.
Joining a crowd of more than 75 stu
dents from around the Bay Area
and intentionally risking arrest,
they rallied alongside dozens at the
San Francisco State Department
Building. They were demonstrating
public solidarity with those 398 ar
rested Sunday protesting the
pipeline in our nation's capital. Nine
were ultimately arrested.
The pipeline that students across
the country were protesting would
bring crude tar sands oil from Al
berta, Canada, through the U.S. to
Texas for export. The final decision
on whether it will be built comes
down to the President and is expect
ed in late spring.
Here is what will happen if Pres
ident Obama approves the Keystone
XL Pipeline:
First, the sole freshwater source
for two million Americans and 30
percent of the nation's groundwater
used for irrigation are at risk of con
tamination if there were to be a spill.
TransCanada has stated that their
Keystone pipelines are the safest on
the continent, and yet their Key
stone One pipeline suffered more
spills in its first year (2010-2011)
than any other first-year pipeline in
U.S. history, with twelve spills.

Second, according to the State
Department's Environmental Im
pact Statement, the tar sands oil will
be some of the dirtiest, most carbon
intensive oil ever produced on a
large scale. Its extraction and re
finement alone will result in 12 to 23
million metric tons of greenhouse
gas emissions annually. This is in ad
dition to combustion of the tar sands
oil, making the life cycle emissions
of the pipeline roughly 5.3 billion
metric tons of carbon dioxide.
Third, it does stunningly little to
increase our energy independence.
The Keystone XL is an export
pipeline. The tar sands oil will come
out of the ground in Canada, flow in
pipes across our country's heartland
(risking our land, air and water in
the transportation process) and ulti
mately wind up loaded onto tankers
for export to China, Latin America
and Europe. In fact, the initial per-

Mit application filed by TransCana
da explicitly states that this in
creased access to overseas markets
will divert the oil Canada currently
produces for America to send it
overseas, increasing gas prices for
those in the American Midwest and
particularly for our farmers.
In a congressional healing, Tran
sCanada's President claimed that
the pipeline will create 20,000 Amer
ican jobs. The State Department in
dicates that the number will be clos
er to 5,000. Moreover, it turns out
only 35 of those jobs would last more
than three years, and only 10 per
cent of any of the positions would be
filled by local workers.
The Keystone drama is the
same story we've seen replayed
for decades on stages of all sizes.
Time and time again, the fossil

ly demanded that our nation
and our world backpedal on
climate policy and emission
regulations. What has galva
nized the nation to act so pur
posefully upon this particular
environmental threat is that
approval of the Keystone XL
Pipeline would make a bla
tantly backward and reac
tionary statement. While the
world has repeatedly agreed
that we desperately need to
take serious steps toward a
safer climate, we as a na
tion are not taking those
steps.
Instead, we continue to
build an energy infrastruc

but extremely dirty forms of
fossil fuels. It's unceasingly
