## Winter in Israel, Part I: Paranoia and victimhood 
### Aly Cash, Jaih Hunter-Hill Amrita Rao 
This is the first in a series of
three articles written by Aly
Cash 'l6, Jaih Hunter-Hill 'l5
and A?nrita Rao 'l5 reflecting
on their experience traveling to
Israel over Winter Break on a
campus leaders mission spon
sored by The David Project,
Seven-year-old Forsan Hussein
was chasing a runaway sheep
up a grassy mountain by his
Arab-Israeli village of Sha'ab when
he came across a group of Jewish
boys from the neighboring town
playing soccer. He watched them
from behind a tree with a fair
amount of confusion. Where were
their horns? He had never actually
seen a Jew before, but he knew all
Jews had horns from the stories his
uncles had told him.
Thirty-four-year-old Forsan
Hussein, CEO of the Jerusalem
YMCA â€” dubbed the "Israeli Oba
ma" as one of the most influential
Arabs in Israeli society shared
his experience with us four weeks
ago, a story that was hard for many
in our group to hear.
We were 33 students from nine
different universities across Ameri
ca, a mixture of Jews and non-Jews
involved in a wide variety of organi
zations on our respective campuses.
What we all had in common was
that we had acknowledged our pre
conceptions about Israel, left them
behind in an airport hotel at JFK
and traveled to Israel to hear the

stories and learn the truths of peo
ple from across the social, religious
and political spectrum. We had
come together through The David
Project, an NGO that works with
students to foster relationship
building skills and facilitate conver
sations among groups with differ
ent perspectives on Israel.
Hussein gave us a particularly
clear framework for the Israeli-
Palestinian situation. Since the cre
ation of Israel, he argues, Jewish Is
raelis have not grown out of their
mindset of fear and paranoia
spawning from their history of per
secution, while the Arab minority
suffers from a mentality of victim
hood, living as it does as a minority
in a majority Jewish state. As long
as this cycle of paranoia and victim
hood continues, and as long as de
fensive walls separating communi
ties remain the norm, all shots at
coexistence will continue to miss
their mark.
Throughout our trip, the per
spectives we collected from ordi
nary Israelis all exemplified some
aspect of this macroscopic trend
that Hussein pinpointed, no matter
how different their individual situa
tions in life. Whether Jewish Israeli,
Arab Israeli or Palestinian, the peo
ple we talked to were not interested
in hashing out the past or fixating
on details of the negotiations. They
all cared more about social and eco
nomic issues that would improve
the everyday quality of life in their

communities. But these are issues
that nevertheless remain low-pro
file due to the immense attention
and resources devoted to the politi
cal Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Put simply, in the international
eye, the Israeli people take a back
seat.
Take the Israeli Defense Forces
(IDF), for example. Israel is widely
denounced for its military system
and is seen as aggressive and au
thoritarian for its policy that every
citizen must serve in the military.
However, the Israeli military has a
very different structure from most
other countries, and locals view it in
a very different light. Ambitious Is
raeli high school students don't
study for the SATs: They prepare
for screening tests for admission in
to the elite units of the army. And
not all IDF personnel serve in com
bat roles: After basic training, new
soldiers have many options for the
kinds of positions they can hold in
the military based on their own in
terests. While some volunteer for
combat, others work as program
mers, nurses or security guards for
tourist groups.
Military training also kick-starts
the spirit of innovation and entre
preneurship that has made Israel a
technological incubator second only
to the United States. We had the op
portunity to visit Google's Israel re
search center, their administrative
hub for the entire Middle East and
even parts of Europe and Africa.

Google recognizes the chutzpah, a
mindset of questioning and chal
lenging norms and quickly moving
forward with new ideas, that makes
Israel the "startup nation" that it is.
The company's initiatives in Is
rael include programs that catalyze
the growth of more promising new
companies. Google Israel has an en
tire floor where startups can rent
space and work under the mentor
ship of experienced Google execu
tives. Another program helps small
businesses without an online pres
ence to develop and promote their
websites to reach international
markets.
The results are striking. Consid
er that Israel gave the world flash
drives, Windows XII Intel dual core
processors, the Waze navigation
system, Answers.com, cherry toma
toes and solar windows. And yet Is
raeli innovation still flies under the
radar for ordinary Americans.
Whatever you've heard about Is
rael from the distant political
standpoint presented in the news,
you can be sure that on-the-ground
perspectives of Israelis will chal
lenge it. In this article and the next
two, we hope to give you snapshots
of the reality of everyday life for
the Israelis that shared their sto
ries with us.
