## Rodgers to turn pro after spring season 
### â€“ Cameron Miller 
In an unsurprising move, Stan
ford junior golfer Patrick Rodgers
announced Monday on Twitter his
decision to join the professional
ranks after the conclusion of the
spring season. The announcement
ends brewing speculation over the
Avon, Ind., native's immediate fu
ture after he rose to the top spot in
the World Amateur Golf Rankings.
Rodgers has started the spring
season in solid form, having already
added another individual victory to

his growing collection at The Pres
tige at PGA West while also leading
his squad to a team win. Though
Rodgers is forgoing his final year of
NCAA eligibility, his coach empha
sized that the seven-time collegiate
event winner is still all-in on help
ing his teammates reach their lofty
goals.
"Patrick has obviously been a
great player for us and we appreci
ate all he's given to the program,"
said head coach Conrad Ray of
Rodgers' decision. "He's got some
great golf ahead of him here in the
next few months and he's very, very
committed to the team."

Despite its magnitude, being the
No. 1 amateur golfer on the planet
may not be the pinnacle of Rodgers
career, which is littered with low
scores and top-10 individual finish
es. He is a two-time PING and
GCAA Ail-American, has twice rep
resented the U.S. in the prestigious
Walker Cup and has already com
peted at the professional level,
most notably finishing T-15th at the
2013 John Deere Classic.
"He's the epitome of a student
athlete," Ray continued. "Based on
the opportunities are potentially
going to present themselves this
summer with his ranking and the
team that he's on, he felt like his
game was in a spot where he was
ready to go tackle the next level.
He's been very forthright and open
with us as the process has unfolded,
so we appreciate that. We appreci
ate the mark he's left on our pro
gram, and his work is not done."
