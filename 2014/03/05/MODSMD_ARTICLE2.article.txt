# From the Farm to the final frontier
## 21 Stanford alumni among NASA's astronauts 
### SAMANTHA NEUBER STAFF WRITER 
Historically, Stanford has held a large presence in
the field of space exploration. Out of the more than 500
astronauts NASA has ever trained, 21 have been Stan
ford graduates.
Stephen Robinson M.S. 'B5 Ph.D. '9l, Steven Smith
'Bl M.S. 'B2 MBA 'B7 and Barbara Morgan '73 are just
three of the Stanford astronauts who demonstrate
that career dreams are never out of reach, even if
those dreams involve going to space.
Time in space
Robinson knew what he wanted to do right from
the beginning.
"All through Stanford, [becoming an astronaut
was] what I wanted to do," Robinson said.
While earning both an M.S. and a doctorate in me
chanical engineering from Stanford, Robinson attend
ed the University mostly part-time as he worked at
NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View.
Robinson also fulfilled his enjoyment of exploration
and the outdoors by taking flying lessons while at
Stanford.
NASA selected Robinson as an astronaut in 1994,
and he subsequently participated in four Space Shut
tle missions: STS-85 in 1997, STS-95 in 1998, STS-114
in 2005 and STS-130 in 2010. During the STS-114 mis
sion, Robinson became the first person to perform an
in-flight repair of the spacecraft's exterior.
Like Robinson, Smith recalled having an interest in
space for as long as he can remember. In fact, Smith
still keeps an illustration of his space dreams that he
had drawn in crayon when he was younger.
Smith earned all three of his degrees at Stanford
and was part of the men's water polo team, serving as
captain during his senior year. Smith credited his in
volvement in athletics as one of the reasons he may
have been chosen for the astronaut program.
"I was competing against incredible people to get
into the astronaut program," Smith said. "When
[NASA] interviewed me, the fact that I had been at
national level athletics and... had led a team in that
environment, I think that really meant something to
them."
While Robinson and Smith both recall early memo
ries of wanting to be astronauts, Morgan's career fol
lowed a slightly different route.
Morgan was interested in a variety of academic ar
eas during her time at Stanford, including medicine,
biology and music. While she was always fascinated
with the space program, she recalled feeling that she
needed to become either a nurse or a schoolteacher, as
were the career norms for women at the time.
Nevertheless, Morgan graduated with distinction
and was later selected in 1985 as a backup teacher for

Christa McAuliffe in NASA's Teacher in Space project
and also served as a mission specialist in the STS-118
mission to the International Space Station.
From Stanford and beyond
Though each astronaut's career played out in dif
ferent ways, one common theme emerged: Stanford is
a good place to be if you are interested in space.
Morgan emphasized her Stanford experience as
one of immense academic exploration, openness and
facilitation.
Morgan remembered taking between 20 and 23
units during multiple quarters in order to achieve the
breadth of education she desired and to fully explore
the opportunities Stanford had to offer.
While becoming an astronaut was not on her mind
during her time at Stanford, Morgan said she "had
[her] eyes open in so many ways to exploration and
discovery."
Robinson also emphasized how Stanford's interdis
ciplinary approach fosters the University's large pres
ence in astronautics and space exploration.
"I think Stanford has always had a huge amount to
contribute both in terms of technical problem-solving
expertise, but also in the deeper layer of intellectual
breadth the awareness that disciplines are connect
ed to each other in nature," Robinson said.
Smith spoke about Stanford's legacy in space

space, a larger number of graduates have been in-

volved in all parts of the
space program.
"You can't help but come
out of [Stanford] ready to be
an ambassador, a diplomat,
really in any business you go

into," Smith said.
Morgan, Smith and
Robinson all agreed that
Stanford will continue to
maintain its presence in
space exploration. Addition
ally, each astronaut men
tioned that Stanford has be
come a leading force in the
newest direction includ
ing space entrepreneurship
and commercialization

that those interested in
space are taking.
"Stanford's in the right
place, and they're doing the
right thing, and they have
an incredible set of opportu
nities and support structure
in place for the space pro
gram," Smith said.
