## ASSU addresses SAFE Reform controversy 
### PETER MOON DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
The 15th Undergraduate Senate con
vened Ihesday evening to discuss lingering
concerns voiced by several student groups
about Student Activities Fee (SAFE) Re
form.
Currently, the bill has been officially ap
proved by both the Undergraduate Senate
and the Graduate Student Council (GSC).
Senator John-Lancaster Finley 'l6, who
had visited the Black Student Union and
the Stanford National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)
to discuss and answer questions regarding
the SAFE Reform, reported that students
voiced dissatisfaction with the changes in
the special and general fees program and
the Major, Minor and Quick grants pro
posed by SAFE Reform.
Some students also opposed the re
placement of the Appropriations Commit
tee with the Funding Board, stating that
this would negatively impact representa
tional democracy by reducing the number
of elected Senators on the Board. Further
more, they also expressed discontent in
student groups' inability to build up mone
tary reserves.
ASSU Financial Analysts Justine
Moore 'l6 and Olivia Moore 'l6, who co-au
thored the SAFE bill, responded to student
groups' concerns.
"SAFE Reform originally had no elect
ed representative," Olivia Moore said. "Af
ter talking to community centers, we real
ized how important it was to have elected
representatives, so we compromised and
added four elected senators to the Funding
Board."
Major and Minor grants, along with

Quick grants, are first reviewed by the
members of the Funding Board. The
Board, assuming a role similar to that of
the Appropriations Committee, makes a
recommendation to the Senate, which then
has the final say on how the money is allo
cated to student groups.
Furthermore, SAFE Reform effective
ly freezes the build-up of reserves, which
has been one of the major causes behind
the increased Student Activities Fees.
"Although student groups' reserves
can't grow, they can still apply to the Find
ing Board to increase their reserves," Jus
tine Moore said.

Senators also discussed the inaccurate
understanding of current special fees pro
gram and the new SAFE Reform. Finley
led the discussion about having compre
hensive educational SAFE Reform meet
ings.
"In order for students to know about it,
we need to do more than expect the stu
dents to read the emails about SAFE Re
form," Finley said.
The SAFE Reform Committee has pre
viously done outreach programs for stu
dent organizations, including a town hall

meeting at Old Union. The
attendees comprised 30 to 40
financial officers and student
group presidents who were
informed about the SAFE

Reform bill and the changes
it would bring to the current
system.
However, to make the bill
more transparent and easier
to understand for the stu
dents, the Senators have de
cided to personally visit stu
dent groups to explain and
answer any questions people
may have regarding the bill.

"I am excited to reach out
to student groups that feel
like they haven't gotten
enough information yet, so
that we can clarify any mis
conception and address their
concerns," said Senate Chair
Ben Holston 'l5.
