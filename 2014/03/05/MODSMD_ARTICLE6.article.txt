## GSB's Ignite invites humanities grad students, Silicon Valley 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford Ignite, a pro
gram offered by the Gradu
ate School of Business' Glob
al Innovation Program, is
now opening up to a wider
range of participants, en
couraging both Silicon Valley
community members and
humanities graduate stu
dents to join its cohort this
summer.
Ignite was developed in
2007 to provide non-business
graduate students an oppor
tunity to experience the aca
demic foundation for start
ing a new company or grow
ing a new line of business
within a corporation.
The program has two ma
jor components: to expose
participants to basic busi
ness fundamentals so that
they have an entrepreneurial
foundation and to place par
ticipants into teams to devel
op business plans that pro
duce real products and ideas.
This is meant to mimic
the intensity of working in a
startup or in a new venture,
said Yossi Feinberg, faculty
director.
According to Feinberg,
one of the major changes the
program recently went
through was adding non-
Stanford expertise to the
program. For example, the
program has expanded its
participant pool to more than
just Stanford students, open
ing the application for Ignite
to professionals in the Silicon
Valley.
"Having that mix of peo

pie in the classroom has only
enhanced the value of the ed
ucation we can provide, away
to mix up backgrounds," said
Bethany Coates MBAO4, as
sociate dean and director of
Stanford Global Innovation
Programs.
Another way that the pro
gram is hoping to increase
the diversity in its partici
pants is through educational
background.
According to Coates, two
thirds of the Ignite students
in the past have come from
the School of Engineering or
the School of Medicine. How
ever, the program is also hop
ing for more students with
humanities backgrounds.
"Humanities majors
bring diversity to the pro
gram and that leads to the
best teams out there. It's ex
tremely important to get
people who have different
perspectives on the same is
sue," Feinberg said.
Coates also expressed
that because the participants
are placed in project groups,
the different experiences
that students have contribute
to the originality of their
work.
"Having a wide variety of
backgrounds in our class is
an important part of innova
tion," Coates said.
One of the core parts of
the program that will not be
changed is the project team
structure in which students
are grouped into teams to de
velop a venture plan.
Samuel Mazin M.S. 'O4
Ph.D. 'O7 PD 'O7, a 2008 par
ticipant, emphasized that the

culmination of the projects
was part of the most signifi
cant experience he had at Ig
nite, in particular when he
was presenting and being
evaluated on his team's ven
ture pitch to senior venture
capitalists (VCs), an experi
ence he likened to being on
American Idol.

"The most critical point
was the opportunity to pres
ent to the VCs and not only
hear their critiques of my
own presentation but to also
observe them critique every
other groups' presentation,"
Mazin said. "They were all
the Simon Cowells of the VC
world, and learning how they
thought and what they
looked for in evaluating an
opportunity was very helpful
and empowering."
Through student feed
back, some improvements
have been introduced to the
project team structure,
which, according to Fein
berg, include focusing on
bringing more attention to
team dynamics in the project
teams as well as finding men
tors from local communities
business who are involved in
industries relevant to the
teams.
Ultimately, the program
places greater emphasis on
learning the skills to develop
a proposal.
"We don't focus on the
project they bring to the
class," Feinberg said. "We fo
cus on the skills they develop
in the class."
