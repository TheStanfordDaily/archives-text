## Crowdsourcing decision making a la Twitch 
### Vignesh Venkataraman 
The Internet probably best
exemplifies the phrase
"agree to disagree." It is a
modern day cyber-wild
wild-west, with scam
mers, thieves and scumbags strolling
across its networked glory. Consen
sus on the Internet is a lot like a pet
unicorn: a hopeful dream that will
never come to pass.
Around the time the Internet was
just getting big, Pokemon Red Ver
sion was released, spawning a gener
ation of kids who grew up shouting
"PIIIIKAAAAACHUUUUUUUU"
at each other. Part of its success lies
in the fact that it is conceptually sim
ple, but that it still requires coordina
tion, timing and thoughtful manage
ment to complete.
Put the two together, and you've
created a riddle wrapped in an enig
ma, shrouded in quandary and sea
soned with essence of paradox.
The saying goes that if you give
an infinite number of monkeys an in
finite number of typewriters, they
will eventually produce the works of
Shakespeare. (Probabilistically
speaking, the Sun will go supernova
and the typewriters will run out of
ink long before then.) If you replace
the monkeys with human beings on
the Internet (the intelligence level re
mains approximately the same), and
the desired result of Shakespeare
with the successful completion of
Pokemon Red (inarguably a task of
the same difficulty), what you've got
is the newfangled craze that has
swept the world's Internet-travelling
population off its collective feet.
Welcome to TwitchPlaysPoke
mon, a thought experiment gone
viral.
The Twitch platform allows peo
ple to control the titular character,
Red, by inputting commands into the
chat window of the game, which up
dates as a 24-hour live-feed. Over the
last two weeks, the Internet has been
abuzz as Red, controlled by legions of
unique puppet masters located all
over the world, has toiled and
toughed his way through the game.
Perhaps you don't think this is dif
ficult? In the hands of a single player,
Pokemon only takes about 20 hours
to complete, but the Internet's utter
lack of synchronization and inability
to plan ahead has yielded truly
comedic results. Imagine for a mo
ment walking up a set of steps in the
bucolic countryside. Then jerking up
wards towards to the city, your ulti
mate destination. Then spinning
around as various people fight to
move you in other directions. Then
checking your knapsack again... and
again... and again... and again...
(throw in a few more "again's" for the
full sense of it). Then jumping down a
ledge and realizing that now you
have to find your way up the steps
again.
If you can't tell, I'm totally sold on
this as a commercial product. I think
TwitchPlays(insert something here)
could become the greatest sport in
the world the "Internet's pas
time," if you will. How can we apply
anarchy to the world we live in? Here
is a list of things easily made better
by wiring them up to Twitch and let
ting the mob rule:
1. Actual government. I'm truly
curious to see what would happen if
government were run on the whims
of the Internet, and if it responded to
every person's command. Would we
declare war on everyone? How many
nukes would be inadvertently fired?
Would Congress just run around in
circles all day without accomplishing
anything (oh wait they do that al
ready)? Or would the government
become more productive with the
wisdom of the collective hive-mind
behind it?
Besides, consider this point: Are
we sure that Russia isn't already do
ing this? What else explains its bipo
lar government and its invasion/not
sure-if-invasion of Ukraine? Fitting
ly, there are anarchy and democracy
modes within the mechanics of
TwitchPlaysPokemon... this can't
just be a coincidence, can it?
2. Being the GM of an NBA team.
Raise your hand if you think your
NBA team's general manager is in
competent ... interesting that
seems to be all of you. In some situa
tions, it is said that pseudo-random
actions can actually have better out
comes than a terrible plan executed
to perfection (for example, see South
Park's characterization of Family
Guy as a show written by manatees).
In the case of the NBA, this concept
totally applies.
Put Twitch in charge of the Cleve-

land Cavaliers, who have as
sembled a team that is both
expensive and awful, and
watch the fun unfold. ESPN's
Bill Simmons, already wed
ded to ESPN's trade simula
tor, would go apoplectic and
start churning out columns
three times a week. There will
be at least one "oh nooooooo"
trade that works out better
for all parties involved, and
because God hates Cleveland,
I'll bet that All-Star Kyrie Irv
ing gets traded for Nemanja
Nedovic.
3. Coaching football. This
is actually surprisingly easy to
do: wire up Twitch to some
computer running Madden,
input the team's offensive and
defensive playbooks, and do

whatever the Internet com
mands. At the very least, no
body could plan against that
team on either side of the ball,
because no one would know
what would be going on. No
one would ever punt on fourth
down, on average the coach
ing could not be worse than
that of Lane Kiffin (sorry Ala
bama) and all the teams would
save money by not having to
pay exorbitant salaries to
coaches.
Of course, Twitch-
PlaysPokemon has been con
tinually abused by trolls in
putting stupid commands.
Some troll will most definitely
call a quarterback draw with
speed-merchant Tom Brady
on fourth-and-24 from his own
20-yard line, leading to a cata
strophic injury that ends
Brady's career. It has been
foretold in the sands of time.
The more I think about
this idea, the more I like it! If

you're actually trying to make
this work, pick a coach at ran
dom each week and have him
call all the plays! If the team
wins, he stays on as coach, and
if he loses, he is replaced (and
summarily executed). We
should test this out next year
at Stanford. At least the Inter
net wouldn't run the Wildcat.
These ideas may be ab
surd, but given the fact that
Pokemon Red was beaten in
around two weeks, my knowl
edge of what is and isn't possi
ble needs recalibration. See
you next week, faithful read
ers; I have some Twitch com
mands that need spamming.

Vignesh Venkataraman has
recently relinquished control
of his own, dec isions, leaving
it all up to the new Internet
phenomenon, Twitch Plays
Vignesh'sLife. Let him what
his next move should be at

competent ... interesting that
seems to be all of you. In some situa
tions, it is said that pseudo-random
actions can actually have better out
comes than a terrible plan executed
to perfection (for example, see South
Park's characterization of Family
Guy as a show written by manatees).
In the case of the NBA, this concept
totally applies.
Put Twitch in charge of the Cleve-

land Cavaliers, who have as
sembled a team that is both
expensive and awful, and
watch the fun unfold. ESPN's
Bill Simmons, already wed
ded to ESPN's trade simula
tor, would go apoplectic and
start churning out columns
three times a week. There will
be at least one "oh nooooooo"
trade that works out better
for all parties involved, and
because God hates Cleveland,
I'll bet that All-Star Kyrie Irv
ing gets traded for Nemanja
Nedovic.
3. Coaching football. This
is actually surprisingly easy to
do: wire up Twitch to some
computer running Madden,
input the team's offensive and
defensive playbooks, and do

whatever the Internet com
mands. At the very least, no
body could plan against that
team on either side of the ball,
because no one would know
what would be going on. No
one would ever punt on fourth
down, on average the coach
ing could not be worse than
that of Lane Kiffin (sorry Ala
bama) and all the teams would
save money by not having to
pay exorbitant salaries to
coaches.
Of course, Twitch-
PlaysPokemon has been con
tinually abused by trolls in
putting stupid commands.
Some troll will most definitely
call a quarterback draw with
speed-merchant Tom Brady
on fourth-and-24 from his own
20-yard line, leading to a cata
strophic injury that ends
Brady's career. It has been
foretold in the sands of time.
The more I think about
this idea, the more I like it! If

you're actually trying to make
this work, pick a coach at ran
dom each week and have him
call all the plays! If the team
wins, he stays on as coach, and
if he loses, he is replaced (and
summarily executed). We
should test this out next year
at Stanford. At least the Inter
net wouldn't run the Wildcat.
These ideas may be ab
surd, but given the fact that
Pokemon Red was beaten in
around two weeks, my knowl
edge of what is and isn't possi
ble needs recalibration. See
you next week, faithful read
ers; I have some Twitch com
mands that need spamming.

Vignesh Venkataraman has
recently relinquished control
of his own, dec isions, leaving
it all up to the new Internet
phenomenon, Twitch Plays

his next move should be at

The Internet probably best
exemplifies the phrase
"agree to disagree." It is a
modern day cyber-wild
wild-west, with scam
mers, thieves and scumbags strolling
across its networked glory. Consen
sus on the Internet is a lot like a pet
unicorn: a hopeful dream that will
never come to pass.
Around the time the Internet was
just getting big, Pokemon Red Ver
sion was released, spawning a gener
ation of kids who grew up shouting
"PIIIIKAAAAACHUUUUUUUU"
at each other. Part of its success lies
in the fact that it is conceptually sim
ple, but that it still requires coordina
tion, timing and thoughtful manage
ment to complete.
Put the two together, and you've
created a riddle wrapped in an enig
ma, shrouded in quandary and sea
soned with essence of paradox.
The saying goes that if you give
an infinite number of monkeys an in
finite number of typewriters, they
will eventually produce the works of
Shakespeare. (Probabilistically
speaking, the Sun will go supernova
and the typewriters will run out of
ink long before then.) If you replace
the monkeys with human beings on
the Internet (the intelligence level re
mains approximately the same), and
the desired result of Shakespeare
with the successful completion of
Pokemon Red (inarguably a task of
the same difficulty), what you've got
is the newfangled craze that has
swept the world's Internet-travelling
population off its collective feet.
Welcome to TwitchPlaysPoke
mon, a thought experiment gone
viral.
The Twitch platform allows peo
ple to control the titular character,
Red, by inputting commands into the
chat window of the game, which up
dates as a 24-hour live-feed. Over the
last two weeks, the Internet has been
abuzz as Red, controlled by legions of
unique puppet masters located all
over the world, has toiled and
toughed his way through the game.
Perhaps you don't think this is dif
ficult? In the hands of a single player,
Pokemon only takes about 20 hours
to complete, but the Internet's utter
lack of synchronization and inability
to plan ahead has yielded truly
comedic results. Imagine for a mo
ment walking up a set of steps in the
bucolic countryside. Then jerking up
wards towards to the city, your ulti
mate destination. Then spinning
around as various people fight to
move you in other directions. Then
checking your knapsack again... and
again... and again... and again...
(throw in a few more "again's" for the
full sense of it). Then jumping down a
ledge and realizing that now you
have to find your way up the steps
again.
If you can't tell, I'm totally sold on
this as a commercial product. I think
TwitchPlays(insert something here)
could become the greatest sport in
the world the "Internet's pas
time," if you will. How can we apply
anarchy to the world we live in? Here
is a list of things easily made better
by wiring them up to Twitch and let
ting the mob rule:
1. Actual government. I'm truly
curious to see what would happen if
government were run on the whims
of the Internet, and if it responded to
every person's command. Would we
declare war on everyone? How many
nukes would be inadvertently fired?
Would Congress just run around in
circles all day without accomplishing
anything (oh wait they do that al
ready)? Or would the government
become more productive with the
wisdom of the collective hive-mind
behind it?
Besides, consider this point: Are
we sure that Russia isn't already do
ing this? What else explains its bipo
lar government and its invasion/not
sure-if-invasion of Ukraine? Fitting
ly, there are anarchy and democracy
modes within the mechanics of
TwitchPlaysPokemon... this can't
just be a coincidence, can it?
