# O-line ready for transition

### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
With the departures of David
Yankey, Khalil Wilkes, Kevin
Danser and Cameron Fleming
from Stanford's offensive line, the
Cardinal will essentially be under
going a full changing of the guard
up front, with four new starters be
ing plugged in to replace the outgo
ing veterans and to join sophomore
left tackle Andrus Peat.

Don't expect a big drop in pro
duction, though, because the four
sophomores that will be stepping
into those positions left guard
Joshua Garnett, center Graham
Shuler, right guard Johnny Caspers
and right tackle Kyle Murphy
were some of the top high-school
linemen in the country who arrived
at the Farm as part of Stanford's
monster 2012 recruiting class.
"We've been sitting around for
two or so years, just waiting for this
opportunity," Shuler said. "Kyle,
Josh and I have had the opportuni
ty to play in a couple of 'big-people'
personnel groupings, but at the
same time, we've really wanted to
get to drive this ship and let it be
ours."
While Shuler and Caspers have
not seen as much game action, Gar
nett saw a lot of playing time last
year as Stanford's primary "ogre"
back an extra lineman set back
from the line of scrimmage behind

the regular linemen —in some of
the heavier "jumbo" packages from
Stanford's offensive line, which also
frequently included Murphy as an
extra tackle. Moving into starting
roles, however, presents a much
larger challenge than entering
every three or four snaps to play as
supplementary linemen.

"You prepare a ton when you're
in those jumbo positions, and you've
got to understand seven, eight,
maybe 15 plays," Shuler said. "But
when you have to grasp and totally
understand and manage and make
all of the calls at this level, as de
manding as this is, it takes an expo
nentially greater amount of effort

and time."
"We've all got to step into a little
more of a leadership role," Murphy
added. "We'd always let [the de
parting veterans] lead; they were
the older guys, they were the expe
rienced guys that really drove our
ship and drove our offense. So now
it's our turn to say, 'Come on guys,
let's go,' and be some of the leaders
on our offensive line."
While head coach David Shaw is
confident in the physical abilities of
his young linemen, he believes that
they still need more work "knowl
edge-wise" in understanding the
nuances of the positions at the in
creased pressure of the collegiate
level. Although the linemen will be
entering then* third season on the
Farm, they have not yet had to
make adjustment calls or apply the
skills that they have learned for a
significant amount of time.
"This is going to be our fourth
time installing some of these plays
... I feel like a lot of the playbook
memorization is over," Garnett said.
"It's time to apply it now."
"We all understand the plays,"
Murphy added. "The biggest thing
is, we're [preparing] against our de
fense. They can do so many things.
We've got great defensive coaches,
so the biggest thing is adjustments.
A lot of the time they might shift
right before the play or the line
backers might move around. So
we've just got to be able to get on
top of that and we've been getting

better and better every practice."
And understandably, they are
ready to step into then* new, expand
ed roles, having been preparing be
hind the scenes for the last two sea
sons.
"As fun as it looked, blocking
safeties and corners for myself and
Murph last year and Graham a little
bit isn't as fun as it looks," Garnett
said. "I think mixing it up with fat
ter guys inside makes it a lot more
fun and we can use a lot more of the
tools that we got recruited to use.

That's what we're meant to do, so
it's definitely easier to come in and
do that and I think it's a lot more
fun, too."

Shaw also mentioned that sever
al players had been having ankle
problems during practices, includ
ing sophomore wide receiver
Michael Rector, who is questionable
for this Saturday's open practice.
While none of the players' injuries
are particularly serious Shaw
clarified that none of them had
more serious high-ankle problems
and that they were "garden-variety
ankle sprains" they still present
a slight setback for the Cardinal as
it negotiates its early-spring prac
tices.

In addition, Shaw spoke positive
ly about the progression of safeties
Kodi Whitfield and Dallas Lloyd,
who both converted from offense to
defense before the start of spring
ball. Whitfield and Lloyd have been
adjusting smoothly and have been
dealing with the more physical ele
ments of playing the position well,
not having to practice separately
from the regular safeties. Shaw was
particularly impressed with Whit
field's grasp of the techniques of the
safety position.
Stanford will have another open
practice, its second of the spring,
this Saturday morning at 9 a.m.

Murph last year and Graham a little
bit isn't as fun as it looks," Garnett
said. "I think mixing it up with fat
ter guys inside makes it a lot more
fun and we can use a lot more of the
tools that we got recruited to use.

That's what we're meant to do, so
it's definitely easier to come in and
do that and I think it's a lot more
fun, too."

Shaw also mentioned that sever
al players had been having ankle
problems during practices, includ
ing sophomore wide receiver
Michael Rector, who is questionable
for this Saturday's open practice.
While none of the players' injuries
are particularly serious Shaw
clarified that none of them had
more serious high-ankle problems
and that they were "garden-variety
ankle sprains" they still present
a slight setback for the Cardinal as
it negotiates its early-spring prac
tices.

In addition, Shaw spoke positive
ly about the progression of safeties
Kodi Whitfield and Dallas Lloyd,
who both converted from offense to
defense before the start of spring
ball. Whitfield and Lloyd have been
adjusting smoothly and have been
dealing with the more physical ele
ments of playing the position well,
not having to practice separately
from the regular safeties. Shaw was
particularly impressed with Whit
field's grasp of the techniques of the
safety position.
Stanford will have another open
practice, its second of the spring,
this Saturday morning at 9 a.m.

With the departures of David
Yankey, Khalil Wilkes, Kevin
Danser and Cameron Fleming
from Stanford's offensive line, the
Cardinal will essentially be under
going a full changing of the guard
up front, with four new starters be
ing plugged in to replace the outgo
ing veterans and to join sophomore
left tackle Andrus Peat.

Don't expect a big drop in pro
duction, though, because the four
sophomores that will be stepping
into those positions left guard
Joshua Garnett, center Graham
Shuler, right guard Johnny Caspers
and right tackle Kyle Murphy
were some of the top high-school
linemen in the country who arrived
at the Farm as part of Stanford's
monster 2012 recruiting class.
"We've been sitting around for
two or so years, just waiting for this
opportunity," Shuler said. "Kyle,
Josh and I have had the opportuni
ty to play in a couple of 'big-people'
personnel groupings, but at the
same time, we've really wanted to
get to drive this ship and let it be
ours."
While Shuler and Caspers have
not seen as much game action, Gar
nett saw a lot of playing time last
year as Stanford's primary "ogre"
back an extra lineman set back
from the line of scrimmage behind

the regular linemen —in some of
the heavier "jumbo" packages from
Stanford's offensive line, which also
frequently included Murphy as an
extra tackle. Moving into starting
roles, however, presents a much
larger challenge than entering
every three or four snaps to play as
supplementary linemen.

"You prepare a ton when you're
in those jumbo positions, and you've
got to understand seven, eight,
maybe 15 plays," Shuler said. "But
when you have to grasp and totally
understand and manage and make
all of the calls at this level, as de
manding as this is, it takes an expo
nentially greater amount of effort

and time."
"We've all got to step into a little
more of a leadership role," Murphy
added. "We'd always let [the de
parting veterans] lead; they were
the older guys, they were the expe
rienced guys that really drove our
ship and drove our offense. So now
it's our turn to say, 'Come on guys,
let's go,' and be some of the leaders
on our offensive line."
While head coach David Shaw is
confident in the physical abilities of
his young linemen, he believes that
they still need more work "knowl
edge-wise" in understanding the
nuances of the positions at the in
creased pressure of the collegiate
level. Although the linemen will be
entering then* third season on the
Farm, they have not yet had to
make adjustment calls or apply the
skills that they have learned for a
significant amount of time.
"This is going to be our fourth
time installing some of these plays
... I feel like a lot of the playbook
memorization is over," Garnett said.
"It's time to apply it now."
"We all understand the plays,"
Murphy added. "The biggest thing
is, we're [preparing] against our de
fense. They can do so many things.
We've got great defensive coaches,
so the biggest thing is adjustments.
A lot of the time they might shift
right before the play or the line
backers might move around. So
we've just got to be able to get on
top of that and we've been getting
