## Card eyes Fac- 12 revenge Stanford aims to retake title from Cal 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
Between 1982 and 2012, Stanford
firmly dictated the world of Pac-12
men's swimming and diving, captur
ing 31 consecutive conference titles
and seven national titles in the
process. However, last season, the
Cardinal was toppled from its
throne by Cal, which edged the Car
dinal 825-800 in the final tally as the
two teams battled to the finish.
Starting today, Stanford will look to
regain that edge in Federal Way,
Wash., as it takes on the Pac-12 field
in the annual conference champi
onship meet.
The Cardinal will be stiffly chal
lenged again by the Golden Bears,
who have finished among the top
two in the NCAA Championships in
each of the last four seasons. This
season, the Bears capped off a per
fect dual-meet season by bringing
the Cardinal's unblemished dual
record crashing to the ground in a
169-74 rout at Avery Aquatic Center
in which it swept the swimming
events.
Stanford will return both of its
individual swimming conference
champions from last season jun
iors Drew Cosgarea and David
Nolan who combined for three
victories at last year's meet.
Cosgarea, who claimed victory in
the 1,650-yard freestyle last season,
will be seeded fifth this year in the
500-yard freestyle and third in the
400-yard individual medley (IM), an
event in which he already owns a
conference title. Meanwhile, Nolan
could easily match or even surpass
his two individual titles from each of
the last two years in the 200 IM and
the 200 backstroke, as he is seeded
in the top four of both of those
events as well as in the 100 back
stroke.
Junior diver Kristian Ipsen, who
won both the 1-meter and 3-meter
diving events at last year's champi
onships, has already defended his 1-
meter title in this past week's Pac-12
Men's Diving Championships while
also finishing as the runner-up in the
3-meter event.
With diving not a factor at this
weekend's swimming champi
onships, the Cardinal swimmers will
be relied upon to carry the team to
victory a tall task, considering
that Cal will likely have an advan
tage in that regard, as evidenced by
Cal's dominance in this year's edi
tion of the Big Swim.
Although championship meets
present different challenges from
dual meets, Cal will still field a
deep, talented squad that has expe
rience in both settings. It will look

to defend its title and make anoth
er deep run into the NCAAs, while
Stanford looks to avenge a disap
pointing Big Swim and return to
the top of the conference.
The meet will kick off today,
with the 200-yard medley relay fi
nal coming at 6 p.m.
