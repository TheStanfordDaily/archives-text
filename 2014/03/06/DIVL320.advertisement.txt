PUBLPOL 134 (PUBLPOL 234/ETHICSOC 234R/LAW 724)
Ethics on the Edge:
Business, Non-Profit Organizations, Government, and Individuals
Spring Quarter 2014 | Units: 2-3 | Grading: Letter or Cr/NC \ UG Req: WAY-ER
The objective of the course is to explore the current international emphasis on organizational ethics. Students will
consider in-depth complex ethics matters across business, the non-profit sector, and government. We will unravel
the factors contributing to the seemingly pervasive failure of ethics today through a broad range of international
case studies and develop a framework for thinking about ethics valid across sectors. Examples include: the
Bangladesh garment factory fire and collapse; corruption in Nigeria; sex abuse in the US military; racism in
international football; drones; social media ethics; and non-profit sector ethics challenges. Prominent guest
speakers will attend certain sessions interactively. Questions of cultural context, how ethics lag behind technology,
ethics and leadership, and ethics and global systemic risks (poverty, financial system meltdown, climate change,
cyber terrorism...) will be considered. Attendance required. Grading is based 25% on short assignments, 35% on
class participation, and 40% on a final project. The final project is on a topic of each students choice, in lieu of
exam. Class participation may include a variety of options beyond simply speaking up in class (e.g. participation
on the class web site, assisting other students with presentations or final projects, participation in relevant
University events, group discussions during office hours).
Note for Law Students: Law students will have an opportunity to substitute certain readings for more legally
focused material and will have the option to choose a final project topic integrating legal analysis. This course
does not meet the SLS professional responsibility requirement. LAW 724 is offered for 2 units.
