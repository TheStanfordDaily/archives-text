# MOWED DOWN AT MAPLES

### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
Even with NFL luminaries An
drew Luck and Richard Sherman
in attendance, a back-and-forth af
fair didn't go Stanford's way on
Wednesday night, as the Cardinal
men's basketball team dropped a
heartbreaker at home to the Col
orado Buffaloes, 59-56.

For the second time this season,
a Chasson Randle 3-point attempt
to tie the game bounced off the rim
at the buzzer, preserving the win
for Colorado (21-9, 10-7 Pac-12).
The loss was the third in a row for
the Cardinal (18-11, 9-8), a serious
setback in the team's quest to ob
tain an at-large bid to the NCAA
tournament later this month. It is
likely that the defeat also cost the
Cardinal a first-round bye in next
week's Pac-12 tournament.
Randle scored 24 points in the
losing effort for the Cardinal, and
was really the only member of the
team who had an offensive impact
in the second half. The junior fin
ished 9-of-18 from the field and was
4-of-7 from three. He was the lone
Stanford player to reach double fig
ures in the game.
"We need more guys, it can't
just be one guy playing offensively,"
said head coach Johnny Dawkins.
"Our offense is built around a bal
anced attack, and we need guys
stepping up and making plays
there."
Senior Josh Huestis added 9
points and 13 rebounds for Stan
ford, but it wasn't enough, as the
Cardinal were repeatedly manhan
dled on the low block by Colorado
sophomore Josh Scott.
Scott finished the night with 17
points and 11 rebounds in leading
the charge for the Buffaloes, which
outrebounded Stanford 39-31 and
grabbed 13 offensive boards. Xavier

Johnson added 14 points and 5 re
bounds for Colorado, while Xavier
Talton provided the clutch shooting.
His 3-pointer with 2:10 remaining
in the second half gave Colorado a
four-point lead, one the Cardinal
would not be able to overcome.
Stanford was plagued by poor
offensive play throughout, as ice
cold shooting in the first half result

ed in a five-point halftime deficit.
The Cardinal shot just 10-of-32
from the field in the first half (31.3
percent) and a paltry l-of-9 from 3-
point range. Stanford finished the
game having made just 36.8 per
cent of its field goal attempts and
23.5 percent of its 3-point attempts.
The Cardinal were also a disap
pointing 10-of-17 from the free

throw line.
The bad statistics piled up for
Stanford in this one, as it marked
the third consecutive outing that
the Cardinal finished with more
turnovers than assists. Stanford
now has just 20 assists compared to
37 turnovers in its last three
games.
"I think our guys are playing a
little too fast," Dawkins said. "I
think we need to slow down and
have some poise, some composure.
We're not being pressured. Our
turnovers a lot of times have been
unforced, and those are the ones
that are disappointing to you."
Senior forward Dwight Powell's
recent struggles continued on
Wednesday night, as the Cardinal's
all-conference performer from a
season ago fouled out in 28 min
utes. Powell finished with just 8
points and 2 rebounds, shooting 3-
of-8 from the floor and committing
4 turnovers to just 1 assist. His
struggles over the past three
games parallel the team's play dur
ing the time period. The Toronto
native made just 8 of his 30 shots
against ASU, Arizona and Col
orado, and he had 10 turnovers to
just 3 assists during that span.
Despite all the negatives, Stan
ford battled back from an eight
point deficit early in the second
half behind some strong defensive
play. The Cardinal, trailing 46-38
with 14:13 left in the game, held
Colorado scoreless over the next
eight minutes and 11 seconds of
play. Randle scored 10 of Stan
ford's 11 points over that stretch,
and his 3-pointer with 4:53 left to
play gave the Cardinal a one-point
lead.
After an Anthony Brown layup
gave Stanford a three-point mar
gin, a frenetic sequence of three de
fensive and two offensive posses
sions turned the Cardinal lead into
a four-point deficit, capped by Tal
ton's 3-pointer with 2:10 left to play.
It was the type of stretch that has
haunted Stanford during Coach
