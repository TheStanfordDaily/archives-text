# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Card face tough slate in SoCal Stanford to visit both Pepperdine and USC 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's volleyball will travel down
south to Los Angeles this weekend to play
two top-ten teams, both of which are coming
off losses on the road. The No. 10 Cardinal
(10-7, 7-7 Pac-12), coming off of their own
loss against Long Beach State, will be play
ing their first road matches in three weeks as
they take on No. 4 Pepperdine on Friday and
No. 6 USC on March 9.
Pepperdine experienced its first loss in its
last four matches this past weekend, losing
to No. 2 BYU in Utah. Despite this loss, Pep
perdine has been playing very impressive
volleyball and is currently 9-4 overall. Stan
ford has won eight of its last 10 meetings
against Pepperdine but the Waves have a his
toric advantage against the Card 27-8 when
playing at home.
Furthermore, Pepperdine has only lost
once at home this regular season, when it
lost in live sets to UC-Santa Barbara. The
Cardinal will have to play aggressively in or
der to become the second team this season to
beat Pepperdine in Malibu. So far this sea
son, the Cardinal are 0-5 in five-set matches,
showing a lack of ability to clean up close
matches. But Stanford has not been swept
this season and have themselves swept eight
teams so far this season.
John Kosty's squad should therefore look
to gain any early lead by coming out aggres
sively and limiting its mistakes. If the Cardi
nal can gain an early lead, its defense is
strong enough that it should be able to hold
on to the advantage. It is when the Cardinal
face close sets that they enter dangerous ter
ritory and are unable to demonstrate
strength in critical points.
Stanford will have an equally tough oppo
nent on Sunday when facing No. 6 USC.
While USC has had a less consistent year
than Pepperdine and has lost three times at
home, Stanford should not underestimate
the Trojans coming into the match. USC is
also coming off a loss at BYU and will be
looking to regain its momentum upon re
turning to the Galen Center before hitting
the road again.
One of the major keys to a successful
weekend for the Cardinal will be to use their
service game as an advantage by limiting all
