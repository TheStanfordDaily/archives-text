# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Card face tough slate in SoCal Stanford to visit both Pepperdine and USC 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's volleyball will travel down
south to Los Angeles this weekend to play
two top-ten teams, both of which are coming
off losses on the road. The No. 10 Cardinal
(10-7, 7-7 Pac-12), coming off of their own
loss against Long Beach State, will be play
ing their first road matches in three weeks as
they take on No. 4 Pepperdine on Friday and
No. 6 USC on March 9.
Pepperdine experienced its first loss in its
last four matches this past weekend, losing
to No. 2 BYU in Utah. Despite this loss, Pep
perdine has been playing very impressive
volleyball and is currently 9-4 overall. Stan
ford has won eight of its last 10 meetings
against Pepperdine but the Waves have a his
toric advantage against the Card 27-8 when
playing at home.
Furthermore, Pepperdine has only lost
once at home this regular season, when it
lost in live sets to UC-Santa Barbara. The
Cardinal will have to play aggressively in or
der to become the second team this season to
beat Pepperdine in Malibu. So far this sea
son, the Cardinal are 0-5 in five-set matches,
showing a lack of ability to clean up close
matches. But Stanford has not been swept
this season and have themselves swept eight
teams so far this season.
John Kosty's squad should therefore look
to gain any early lead by coming out aggres
sively and limiting its mistakes. If the Cardi
nal can gain an early lead, its defense is
strong enough that it should be able to hold
on to the advantage. It is when the Cardinal
face close sets that they enter dangerous ter
ritory and are unable to demonstrate
strength in critical points.
Stanford will have an equally tough oppo
nent on Sunday when facing No. 6 USC.
While USC has had a less consistent year
than Pepperdine and has lost three times at
home, Stanford should not underestimate
the Trojans coming into the match. USC is
also coming off a loss at BYU and will be
looking to regain its momentum upon re
turning to the Galen Center before hitting
the road again.
One of the major keys to a successful
weekend for the Cardinal will be to use their
service game as an advantage by limiting all
service errors. Stanford has had a
very up and down service game so
far this season; when Stanford's
service game is strong it is a major
advantage but when the Cardinal
make mistakes from the service
line, it is often the area their oppo
nent capitalizes off the most. In
Stanford's loss against Long
Beach State last weekend, they
struggled behind their serves and
Long Beach State was able to use
Cardinal errors to their advan
tage. If Stanford is able to limit its
service game miscues, it will gain
an offensive edge against oppo
nents that will be hard for either
USC or Pepperdine to shut down.
Another critical component to a
victorious road trip for the Cardi
nal will be the continued leader
ship of senior outside hitter Brian
Cook, who has been leading Stan
ford's offense in kills per match in
recent weeks. Stanford will also
look to senior opposite Eric
Mochalski, who was named MPSF

Player of the Week on Feb. 24.
Overall, the Cardinal's offense
has been strong throughout the en
tire season, but Stanford has strug
gled with limiting its mistakes. The
Card have played well in losses this
season that they ultimately
dropped when they allowed their
opponents to gain critical advan
tages in the final moments. If Stan
ford is able to remain strong
throughout the whole match and
not allow either Pepperdine or USC
to gain a late-match advantage,
then Stanford can have a successful
road trip and leave Los Angeles
with much-needed momentum for
the final stretch of the season.
The closing few weeks of the
season will be very telling for the
Cardinal, who have had some very
impressive wins but more often
have had tough losses that they
could have won.
The Cardinal will play Pepper
dine in Malibu at 7 p.m. on Friday
and USC in a Sunday matchup on
March 9. The USC match will be
broadcasted on the Pac-12 Net
works.

last four matches this past weekend, losing
to No. 2 BYU in Utah. Despite this loss, Pep
perdine has been playing very impressive
volleyball and is currently 9-4 overall. Stan
ford has won eight of its last 10 meetings
against Pepperdine but the Waves have a his
toric advantage against the Card 27-8 when
playing at home.
Furthermore, Pepperdine has only lost
once at home this regular season, when it
lost in live sets to UC-Santa Barbara. The
Cardinal will have to play aggressively in or
der to become the second team this season to
beat Pepperdine in Malibu. So far this sea
son, the Cardinal are 0-5 in five-set matches,
showing a lack of ability to clean up close
matches. But Stanford has not been swept
this season and have themselves swept eight
teams so far this season.
John Kosty's squad should therefore look
to gain any early lead by coming out aggres
sively and limiting its mistakes. If the Cardi
nal can gain an early lead, its defense is
strong enough that it should be able to hold
on to the advantage. It is when the Cardinal
face close sets that they enter dangerous ter
ritory and are unable to demonstrate
strength in critical points.
Stanford will have an equally tough oppo
nent on Sunday when facing No. 6 USC.
While USC has had a less consistent year
than Pepperdine and has lost three times at
home, Stanford should not underestimate
the Trojans coming into the match. USC is
also coming off a loss at BYU and will be
looking to regain its momentum upon re
turning to the Galen Center before hitting
the road again.
One of the major keys to a successful
weekend for the Cardinal will be to use their
service game as an advantage by limiting all
service errors. Stanford has had a
very up and down service game so
far this season; when Stanford's
service game is strong it is a major
advantage but when the Cardinal
make mistakes from the service
line, it is often the area their oppo
nent capitalizes off the most. In
Stanford's loss against Long
Beach State last weekend, they
struggled behind their serves and
Long Beach State was able to use
Cardinal errors to their advan
tage. If Stanford is able to limit its
service game miscues, it will gain
an offensive edge against oppo
nents that will be hard for either
USC or Pepperdine to shut down.
Another critical component to a
victorious road trip for the Cardi
nal will be the continued leader
ship of senior outside hitter Brian
Cook, who has been leading Stan
ford's offense in kills per match in
recent weeks. Stanford will also
look to senior opposite Eric
Mochalski, who was named MPSF

Player of the Week on Feb. 24.
Overall, the Cardinal's offense
has been strong throughout the en
tire season, but Stanford has strug
gled with limiting its mistakes. The
Card have played well in losses this
season that they ultimately
dropped when they allowed their
opponents to gain critical advan
tages in the final moments. If Stan
ford is able to remain strong
throughout the whole match and
not allow either Pepperdine or USC
to gain a late-match advantage,
then Stanford can have a successful
road trip and leave Los Angeles
with much-needed momentum for
the final stretch of the season.
The closing few weeks of the
season will be very telling for the
Cardinal, who have had some very
impressive wins but more often
have had tough losses that they
could have won.
The Cardinal will play Pepper
dine in Malibu at 7 p.m. on Friday
and USC in a Sunday matchup on
March 9. The USC match will be
broadcasted on the Pac-12 Net
works.

Senior opposite Eric Mochalski (above), third on the team in kills per
set, figures to be a key facet of Stanford's offense as the Card travel
south to face top-10 conference opponents Pepperdine and USC.
