# FINAL TUNE-UP
## Card hosts last tourney before Pac-12 season 
### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The final countdown towards the start of Pac
-12 softball has already begun for the Stanford
Cardinal, as the Stanford Louisville Slugger
Classic is now all that stands between the Card
and their pre-finals-week matchup with archrival
Cal to start Pac-12 play. The Cardinal will face
four teams this weekend at Boyd and Jill Smith
Family Stadium: the BYU Cougars, the Portland
State Vikings, the North Dakota State Bison and
the UC-Davis Aggies.

Stanford will begin the tourney with a Thurs
day night matchup against BYU. The Cougars
(7-10) have had an up-and-down start to their
season so far; BYU's high point in its 2014 cam
paign was certainly its victory over then-No. 2
Tennessee as part of last weekend's San Diego
Classic. In handing the Volunteers their only
loss of the season so far, BYU jumped on UT
starter Cheyenne Tarrango, tagging her for
seven hits and three earned runs. The Cougars'
win over the Volunteers highlights the potency
of their offense: the squad has scored 97 runs in
17 games this season, representing an average

of nearly six runs per contest.
However, BYU's struggles this season have
coincided with some severe lapses in the circle.
The Cougars' pitching staff has posted an sky
high team ERA of 5.35 thus far, with its low
point coming in a doubleheader against Nevada
and then-No. 22 Minnesota on Feb. 15; in those
two contests as part of the Easton Desert Clas
sic, BYU gave up 20 runs to the Wolfpack and
13 runs to the Gophers.

After facing the Cougars on Thursday
night, the Cardinal will square off against the
Portland State Vikings and the North Dakota
State (NDSU) Bison in a Friday afternoon dou
bleheader. The Vikings (3-9) have already faced
two Pac-12 squads this season, having lost to
both Cal and Utah in previous non-conference
tournaments. Portland State has also had sig
nificant pitching problems this season, with a
team ERA of 5.94. The Vikings are led on of
fense by junior Aubrey Nitschelm, who is hit
ting .324 with a home run and 10 RBIs so far this
season.
The Bison (10-6) have had a solid start to their
2014 season, with victories over No. 23 Notre
Dame and Houston, two 2013 NCAA tourna
ment teams. NDSU has hit well as a team, post
ing a .305 batting average, while scoring more
than five runs per game. The NDSU lineup cur-

rently features four players batting
above .325, including All-Summit
League first team selection and Bay
Area product Jenina Ortega.
Finally, the Cardinal will cap off
the Stanford Louisville Classic with
a rematch on Sunday afternoon
against UC-Davis. The Cardinal
blasted the Aggies (7-16) in their
first meeting in Davis, Calif.; the
Card proceeded to mercy-rule
Davis in five innings by a 10-1 mar
gin. In that contest, junior Cassan
dra Roulund tied her career high
with 5 RBIs against the Aggies, in
cluding a bases-clearing double in

the top of the third inning of that
game that broke a scoreless draw
and gave the Card a 3-0 lead.
Davis has faced a tremendously
difficult opening stretch to its 2014
campaign. To date, the Aggies have
played eight teams that have been
ranked at some point this season,
with a single victory over Arkansas
to show for then 1 efforts. On the oth
er hand, Davis has been run-ruled
by four ranked teams, including 17-
1 and 16-2 routs at the hands of Bay
lor and Washington, respectively.
The Aggies did play a close game
against then-No. 24 Notre Dame,
falling 12-11 in an offensive slugfest
during the Mary Nutter Collegiate
Classic.
UC-Davis' pitching rotation has
struggled against elite competition
so far this year, as starters Dana

Cruse and Leah Munden have both
posted ERAs north of 4.00. In turn,
a third starter, freshman Andrea
Reynolds, has a 3.93 ERA and 2-4
record in 16 appearances. Offen
sively, the Aggies are anchored by
sophomore Kelly Zboralske, who is
first or second on her team in bat
ting average, RBIs, home runs,
slugging percentage and total
bases.
Stanford begins the Louisville
Slugger Classic at 6 p.m. on Thurs
day night against BYU at Boyd and
Jill Smith Family Stadium, followed
by Friday matchups with Portland
State and North Dakota State Uni
versity at 2:30 p.m. and 4:45 p.m.,
respectively.
