## Papa Putin: Russia's Narrative of Paternalism 
### James Bradbury 
Over the weekend, the "Russ
ian military intervention" that
I claimed last week was "un
likely" came to pass, and on Hiesday
morning Russian President
Vladimir Putin gave an hour-long
press conference at times ram
bling, almost stream-of-conscious
ness; at times frustrated and impa
tient where, instead of explaining
why Russia had invaded Crimea, he
denied that the occupying soldiers
were Russian at all.
But apart from this KGB-like
disavowal of an obvious and easily
confirmed truth, Putin's press con
ference gave a surprisingly unfil
tered insight into the Russian per
spective on the Ukrainian revolution
and the blind spots of that per
spective. This was not a press con
ference of a blustering leader at the
top of his game but of a man caught
off guard. After the intervention,
the Russian President was left to re
ly on his uniquely Putinesque wit
and geopolitical common sense to
reclaim the mantle of political rea
sonableness which, at the best of
times, has defined his international
self-image. In order to do this, he
had to smear Maidan's central mo
tives and tactics as unreasonable or
ignore them altogether.
Vladimir Putin's goal on March 4
was to build a Russian narrative of
the Ukraine crisis that is coherent
enough to be accepted, and presum
ably repeated, by those whose de
fault position is mistrust of the West.
He undoubtedly succeeded. But
that doesn't mean he was right.
From the very beginning, Putin
said he "understands the people on
Maidan who are calling for radical
change." With an amusing, but not
entirely unjustified elision of the
whole Soviet period, he acknowl
edged that "the ordinary Ukrainian
citizen, the ordinary guy, suffered
during the rule of Nicholas 11, dur
ing the reign of Kuchma, and
Yushchenko and Yanukovych." And
in a final, self-serving flourish: "Cor
ruption has reached dimensions that
are unheard of here in Russia."
In the most charitable interpre
tation of Putin's point of view, it is
only Maidan's revolutionary meth
ods which are unacceptable, and
they are unacceptable only because
they are unreasonable. Putin called
the protesters' unwillingness to ac
cept last week's transitional peace
agreement "foolish" and insinuated
(without much irony) that the pur
pose of them extra-constitutional (or
revolutionary, they amount to the
same thing) actions was to "humili
ate someone." Putin's basic claim,
and one that deserves a closer look,
is this: "Only constitutional means
should be used on the post-Soviet
space, where political structures are
still very fragile, and economies are
still weak."
Much of the area of modern
Ukraine has been under Russian
control for almost its entire history,

and Putin's rhetoric is fundamental
ly paternalistic. To Putin, Ukraine is
defined by its status as a state in
"post-Soviet space," and thus as the
unstable child of Soviet stability.
And the Ukrainian oligarchy, the
context for Yanukovych's corrup
tion, is simply a lesser, and more
broken, version of Moscow's com
paratively functional economic sys
tem: "Here in Russia we have many
problems, and many of them are
similar to those in Ukraine, but
they are not as serious as in
Ukraine."
This way of thinking has no
place for three of the most impor
tant aspects of Maidan's philosophy
and message its European out
look, its nationalism and its revolu
tionary idealism.
First, if Ukraine is a post-Soviet
state with post-Soviet problems
problems Russia understands, ac
knowledges and believes itself to be
overcoming then in Putin's view,
Maidan's insistence that Ukraine's
near-term future lies in Europe is
clearly unreasonable, especially
when, as Putin notes, "just about all
[of Ukraine's] engineering products
are exported to Russia."
Second, Ukraine is the home of
the original Russian state, and in
many ways the closest thing to an
equal partner that Moscow had in
the Soviet Union throughout the So
viet period (especially during World
War II) so a "Ukrainian national
ism," conceived in opposition to Rus
sia, is a fundamentally unreasonable
idea and must actually be unrecon
structed fascism.
Third, and perhaps most mad
deningly for Putin, Maidan dis
played a positively American thirst
for revolution for its own sake, even
after most of its demands were met
by the government in Kiev. Much
like the objectively unreasonable
revolutionaries in the Continental
Congress of the American colonies,
Maidan ultimately transcended the
concrete goals of Yanukovych's exit
and the restoration of the 2004 Con
stitution in favor of abstractions like
freedom and democracy.
In case it wasn't understood the
first time, Putin kept reiterating his
point about revolution: "You have to
understand that this kind of chaos is
the worst possible thing for coun
tries with a shaky economy and un
stable political system."
But it isn't really a point about
revolution at all. The "chaos" which
Putin sees sweeping Ukraine a
chaos which he sensationally likens
several times to the disordered
Weimar political context out of
which the Nazi party rose is real
ly nothing of the sort. What Putin
fears in Ukraine is a true â– politics in
the post-Soviet space and thus a
compelling, nearby alternative to his
own cheap imitation.
