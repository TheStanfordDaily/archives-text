## New Challenges to Campaign Finance Regulation 
### David Friedman Thomas Fu 
On Oct. 8, 2013, the Supreme
Court heard oral arguments
in the case of McCutcheon v.
Federal Election Commission.
Though perhaps not as consequen
tial as some of the other cases before
the Court this term, McCutcheon
concerns the always-controversial
issue of campaign finance. In partic
ular, it involves a challenge to the Bi
partisan Campaign Reform Act's bi
ennial caps aggregate contributions.
These caps are just one small
part of the complex web of restric
tions on campaign contributions that
Congress has erected in order to
regulate money in politics. They do
exemplify some of the myriad regu
lations of campaign finance, so here
an explanation is desirable. Under
this particular scheme, there are two
categories of restrictions: "base"
contribution limits and "aggregate"
contribution limits.
Base contribution limits restrict
the amount of money that individu
als can contribute to any particular
candidate, state or local political par
ty committee, national political party
committee or other political commit
tee during a two-year election cycle.
Aggregate contribution limits, or
caps, restrict the total amount of
money that individuals can con
tribute to these categories of politi
cal entities combined during the
course of this same cycle.
For instance, during the time pe
riod relevant to McCutcheon, an in
dividual could contribute $5,200 to
any single candidate of their choice
($2,600 for the primary and $2,600
for the general election) but only
$48,600 to all candidates combined.
Similarly, individuals could donate
$32,400 to any single national party
committee but only $74,600 to all na
tional party committees combined.

Some legal context is needed to
understand the challenge to these
aggregate caps. Since the 1976 case
Buckley v. Valeo, the Court has
drawn a constitutional distinction
between campaign contributions and
campaign expenditures. In short, the
government is generally allowed to
place limits on the amount of money
that individuals and entities can con
tribute to individual candidates and
political committees, but it cannot
place limits on the amount of money
that individuals and entities can in
dependently spend on political ac
tivities, such as (in recent years) do
nations to SuperPACs.
In the words of the Court, regula
tion of campaign spending restricts
"core First Amendment rights of po
litical expression," while campaign
contributions "lie closer to the edges
than to the core of political expres
sion." The basic intuition behind this
contrast is that campaign spending
represents direct political speech,
while the expressive value of cam
paign contributions is tempered by
the fact that these contributions are
indirect forms of expression the
contributor must rely on the candi
date to ultimately turn the contribu
tion into speech.
Still, even the regulation of cam
paign contributions is subject to
some scrutiny. All such regulations
must advance a "sufficiently impor
tant interest" and "employ means
drawn to avoid unnecessary abridg
ment of associational freedoms." The
petitioner in this case, Shaun Mc-
Cutcheon, is arguing that the bienni
al aggregate caps do not meet this
standard. McCutcheon's basic argu
ment is that these caps effectively
serve no governmental interest, and
certainly not a "sufficiently impor
tant" one.

In McCutcheon's view, while al
lowing a donor to contribute an enor
mous sum of money to a particular
candidate may unacceptably risk
corrupting the political process,
there is no similar danger involved in
donating $2,600 to twenty different
candidates, or even one hundred dif
ferent candidates. He argues that
the small amount of each contribu
tion limits the risk of corrupting any
particular candidate, and further
more that there is no reason why
candidates should take heed of the
aggregate amount of contributions
made by a contributor. In Politico, he
wrote, "Somehow, I can give the indi
vidual limit, now $2,600, to 17 candi
dates without corrupting the sys
tem. But as soon as I give that same
amount to an 18th candidate, our
democracy is suddenly at risk."
The government has mustered
two principal arguments in response.
First, it argues that the aggregate
caps are a necessary corollary to the
limits on contributions to particular
candidates and entities. This is be
cause without them, wealthy contribu
tors could contribute small amounts
to large numbers of independent com
mittees, who could in turn funnel this
money to specific candidates. Second,
the government argues that Mc-
Cutcheon ignores the realities of the
party system: There may not be a
huge risk of corruption involved in do
nating $2,600 to ten different candi
dates of the same party, but there
surely is a risk of corruption involved
in donating this same amount to eveiy
single Republican or Democratic can
didate that runs for Congress.
Much of the oral argument for this
case centered on the whether the
government's latter point has
proven true in practice. In this re
spect, the Justices seemed some
what disappointed with the lack of
hard evidence collected by the dis
trict court below. This did not stop
them, however, from posing a num
ber of hypotheticals about how re
moving aggregate limits might or
might not corrupt the political
process.
Observers paid particularly close
attention to those posed by Chief
Justice Roberts, who has served as
the swing vote in past campaign fi
nance cases. At one point in the ar
gument, he expressed concern with
the impact of these limits on small
donors, asking if an individual inter
ested in both gun control and envi
ronmental regulation must effective
ly choose between the two because
he can only donate to so many candi
dates in any given cycle. Neverthe
less, Roberts still seemed wary of
the possibility that individual dona
tion limits may be circumvented if
the aggregate caps are removed.
This could mean that a compromise
of some kind is in the works.
In the end, regardless of the out
come, the landscape of campaign fi
nance is unlikely to change much. As
Justice Scalia pointed out during the
oral argument, even if the contri
butions of wealthy individuals are
limited by the aggregate caps, they
can still spend as much as they like.
The caps, for example, did not stop
Sheldon Adelson from spending at
least $9B million during the 2012
election campaign. Nevertheless,
McCutcheon may provide crucial
clues for how the Court will ap
proach more consequential and divi
sive campaign finance cases in the
future.
