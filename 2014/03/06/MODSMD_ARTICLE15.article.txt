## Winter in Israel, Part II: Minorities and the State 
### Aly Cash, Jaih Hunter-Hill Amrita Rao 
This is the second in a series
of three articles written by
Aly Cash 'l6, Jaih Hunter-
Hill 'l5 and Amrita Rao 'l5 re
flecting on their experience trav
eling to Israel over Winter Break
on a campus leaders mission
sponsored By The David Project.
Let us re-introduce you to For
san Hussein, the Arab Israeli CEO
of the Jerusalem YMCA. In his di
alogue with us, Hussein empha
sized that Israel still has a lot of
untapped potential in its minority
population.
Arabs make up 20 percent of Is
raeli citizens but contribute a much
smaller share of Israel's GDE Over
half the families under the poverty
line are Arab, but there are large
discrepancies in government fund
ing for Arab needs, including edu
cation. According to some esti
mates, Jewish schools receive
three times as much funding as
Arab schools. Most Arab children
don't even learn Hebrew, which
makes it much harder for them to
find employment in Israel.
In an effort to bridge these di
vides in Israeli society, in recent
years a growing movement for
mixed schooling is bringing Arab
and Jewish students together to
learn in a bilingual environment.
Hussein's Yad B' Yad, or Hand in
Hand Center for Jewish-Arab Ed
ucation, leads the way in using
schools as the first step on the lad

der to a well-integrated Israeli so
ciety.
Social dynamics within Arab
communities widen the ethnic gap
by stigmatizing women's full inclu
sion into society. Amna, an Arab Is
raeli woman whose home we visit
ed, shared with us her story of
fierce dedication to social change.
She has firsthand experience of
what it means to choose between
her father's wishes and her press
ing desire to make far-reaching so
cial change for the Arab Israeli
community.
As a young woman, Amna had a
drive to set a new precedent for
women within her community. This
took her outside the borders of her
village to nearby Israeli cities
where she worked, learned He
brew and was introduced to a new
and foreign way of thinking by her
newfound Jewish Israeli friends.
Today, Amna realizes that her life
experiences greatly inform her
ability to reshape traditional
norms surrounding female autono
my as she educates women within
her community about the very
things that have made her so suc
cessful.
On a broader scale, Arab Is
raelis like Amna sit in the hot seat
of the Middle East not fully in
tegrated into Israeli society, but al
so denounced as traitors by their
fellow Arabs just for staying in
their homes and communities.
When 1948 peace efforts drew the

Green Line (Israel's border until
1967), the village of Barta'a was di
vided, with one half within the
state of Israel and the other half in
the West Bank. Some Muslim men
even had to choose between wives
and houses on different sides of the
line.
When the two halves were re
united in 1967 after the Six Day
War, the post-partition differences
in the two parts became very ap
parent. Those on the Israeli side
looked forward to rejoining the
other half of their extended fami
lies, but were met with suspicion
and disdain by the Palestinian half
of Barta'a, who had been taught
that Arabs who stayed in Israel
were traitors and enemies.
Today, Arab Israelis and Pales
tinians don't identify as the same
community. While in Barta'a, we
talked with two Palestinian men
from the West Bank working in a
fruit stand owned by an Arab Is
raeli. Palestinian workers often
earn less than half of the Israeli
minimum wage and have to wait
hours at checkpoints while travel
ing to and from work every day.
Though only a few hours away
these men had never been to Tel
Aviv because they only had work
permits for Barta'a. But when
asked if they would want Israeli
citizenship if given the opportunity,
they said they didn't need it. They
didn't feel marginalized by Israel
or even connected to it in any way

nor did they desire to have a con
nection to Israel. To them, Israel
was just a place that they worked,
with wages that, though low, were
better than those at home.

Same-sex rights are a minority
issue in Israel that has received a
lot of international attention, with
the media accusing Israel of
"pinkwashing" using the fagade
of a modern pro-gay mentality as a
public relations tool while policies
remain stubbornly homophobic. In
reality, these policies do not reflect
the social climate that the Israeli
LGBT community experiences.
While same-sex marriage cere
monies cannot be performed in Is
rael, Israel is the only country in
the Middle East or Asia to recog
nize same-sex marriages per
formed elsewhere. Tel Aviv has
emerged as "the gay capital of the
Middle East," as Out magazine
puts it, and Israeli same-sex cou
ples can have a marriage that is
recognized by the state if it is per
formed in a country that recognizes
such marriages. This policy also ap
plies to any heterosexual couple
wishing to have a non-Orthodox
marriage, even if they are Jewish.
Yet Israel's Jewish Orthodox
community (approximately 20 per
cent of the Israeli Jewish popula
tion) takes a very different position.
We had the opportunity to talk to
