# SPRINGING FORWARD
## 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
It's a busy time of the year in
sports football is over, but
March Madness is just around the
corner and Spring Training is in full
swing. On the opposite end of the
spectrum, the academic quarter is
heating up in advance of Finals
Week and tax season is looming on
the horizon. Apparently, the Stan
ford men's and women's golf pro
grams got the "busy" memo, as
there has been a flurry of activity
around both teams in the last few
weeks a period punctuated with
big team and individual wins as well
as an ever bigger announcement.
The look-back first visits the
California desert, where the Stan
ford men eked out an impressive
team victory at The Prestige at
PGA West, which concluded Feb.
19. It was certainly a unique and
exciting week for the nine Cardinal
golfers, many of whom welcomed
their families to La Quinta. There
was no shortage of drama, either,
although no one would have pre
dicted a crazy finish after just hav
ing looked at the first round scores.

The Card jumped out to a sizeable
13-stroke lead over Pac-12 foe No.
19 UCLA after the first 18 holes,
spurred by identical 6-under 65s
via junior Patrick Rodgers and
freshman Maverick McNealy.
And though head coach Conrad
Ray's squad fell back to Earth on
Tuesday in terms of its cumulative
team score, it actually pushed its
advantage to 14. Wednesday's wild
final round, however, was a little
less smooth for Stanford, which
saw conference mate No. 11 Wash
ington make a daring run up the
leaderboard. The Huskies received
clutch 7-under and 5-under per
formances from Trevor Simsby and
Gerrit Chambers, respectively, en
route to a 14-under 270 round a
score which would have tied the
Cardinal had it not been for senior
Cameron Wilson's 2-under 69. Ulti
mately, the Card held off Washing
ton by two strokes and a streaking
Bruins quintet by 10 shots.
On the individual side, Rodgers,
despite shooting even-par 71 on the
final day after being 9-under
through 36 holes, held off a streak
ing Max Rottluff of Arizona State
to win the event by one stroke. The

victory gives the two-time PING
Ail-American seven wins in his col
legiate career before he plans to
leave Stanford in May to pursue a
spot on the PGA Tour. Other top-10
finishes for the Cardinal were
turned in by Wilson, who carded a
cumulative 6-under, and freshman
Jim Liu, who came in at 4-under.
"We did a nice job of scoring on
our par-3s, which is something we
focused on in practice and prepara
tion," Ray commented on his
team's play at The Prestige. "It was
fun to see Wilson and Rodgers both
contending... but it was a full-team
contribution."
Stanford is back in action to
morrow at the Southern Highland
Collegiate Masters in Las Vegas, a
tournament Rodgers won in a play
off last year. Ray has emphasized a
few key things in advance of the
event, including preparing for the
"fast, undulating putting surfaces"
the team will face.

As successful as the men were,
their female counterparts matched
them stride for stride. The Stan
ford women's golf team too pro
duced great team and individual
performances, maintaining its hot
start to the spring season. After
winning the Peg Barnard Invita
tional, the Cardinal headed south to
the UC-Irvine Invitational, enter
ing the event as the class of the
field and the favorites. A 54-hole, 2-
day tournament, the Card cement
ed their lead after round one, out
pacing eventual second-place fin
isher Texas A&M by eight strokes.
Sophomore Mariah Stackhouse
minimized her mistakes on the first
day of play, carding only two bo
geys in 36 holes of play to put her
self in the driver's seat of the indi
vidual standings. Stackhouse and
the team would preserve their
leads over the final round, with
Stackhouse defeating Grace Na of
Peppei'dine by two shots and the
team eventually besting the afore
mentioned Aggies by thirteen.

Head coach Anne Walker's team
will look to continue its auspicious
start and excellent play at the Dar
ius Rucker Invitational, which also
begins tomorrow and will be played
on the Long Cove Course in Hilton
Head, S.C.
Stackhouse, recently named the
Pac-12's Women's Golfer of the
Month for February, is familiar
with the course as if she didn't
have enough of an advantage al
ready.
"I played Long Cove a number
of years ago for a junior tourna
ment and did well, so I'm excited to
get back," Stackhouse said of the
venue for Darius Rucker. "It's the
kind of course you have to play
smart and respect. It's fun and
challenging, and the members love
to open their course to amateur
competition. I think the biggest
challenge we'll face this week as a
team is the cold, rainy weather ex
pected the first couple of days."
