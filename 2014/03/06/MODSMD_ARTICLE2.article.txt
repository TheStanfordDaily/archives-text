# Q&A KATHRYNSTONER SENIOR FELLOW AT THE FREEMAN SPOGLI INSTITUTE
## 
### EDWARD NGAI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On Nov. 21,2013, thousands gathered at
Kiev's Maidan Nezalezhnosti demonstrat
ing against then-President Viktor
Yanukovych's suspension of policies that
brought Ukraine closer with the European
Union. For months, tensions in the former
Soviet republic have been building as two
opposing forces pull at the Ukraine, with
the European Union on one hand and Rus
sia on the other.
On Feb. 23, the deposed Yanukovych
fled Kiev for Russia.
This past weekend, Russian President
Vladimir Putin was given military authority
to intervene in Crimea, prompting swift

condemnations from the United States and
European governments. Reports suggest
that as many as 15,000 Russian troops have
been mobilized to the Ukraine.
To better understand the complex and
dynamic situation, The Daily spoke to
Kathryn Stoner, senior fellow at the FVee
man Spogli Institute (FSI) and an expert on
contemporary Russia.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What is the
nature of Russia's relationship with the
Ukraine, specifically, the Crimea region?
Kathryn Stoner (KS): Russia has a sev
eral-centuries long relationship with
Crimea Catherine the Great established
a warm water port there for Russia, Russi
a's only warm water port. Ethnic Russians

are actually the majority of the population
in Crimea, where there are also ethnic
Ukrainians and about 12 percent Crimean
Tatars.
TSD: How would you characterize the
current situation in Crimea? Is it an inva
sion?
KS: Crimea, for all intents and purpos
es, is now annexed to Russia. The govern
ment in Kiev would prefer that not be the
case and will obviously fight that, of course
it's not legal, there's absolutely nothing
in international law that says you can do
that. Crimea is a province of Ukraine, a part
of Ukraine.

TSD: There are prominent
reports in Russian media
about "armed people" in Kiev
promoting lawlessness. What's
your reaction?
KS: It's a lie. It's propagan
da, perpetuation of stereo
types from 70 years ago. Ei
ther Putin is getting wrong in
formation about what is hap
pening or is wittingly spread
ing this. It's quite possible he's
just being given wrong infor
mation ... One of the terrible
ironies here is that the only
people to have died in this are
ethnic Ukrainians, shot on by
them own government two
weeks ago.
TSD: Does the United
States have an obligation or a
right to get involved?
KS: I think we, Europe and
NATO countries more gener
ally have an obligation. This is
pretty bald aggression, mili
tary aggression, on a sover
eign state. There is no U.N.
mandate that the Russians
had to go in. They had no di
rect evidence of violence that
they can show us or anyone
else that warrants this. It's
not even like Georgia, in 2008,
when Georgians had fired a
few shots before the Russians
went in. In this case, there is
nothing that can warrant
baldly grabbing Crimea from
the Ukraine.
The post hoc justification
that Putin is giving now is that
the legitimately elected presi
dent of Ukraine, Yanukovych,
was tossed out illegitimately,
in a coup. But that raises oth
er questions, like how
Yanukovych was ousted by an
elected Parliament on a unani
mous vote. He also chose to
flee. He walked away, saying
his life was under threat. Why
did he run away?
TSD: How do you think
the U.S. has handled the situa
tion so far? What can the U.S.
really do in situations like
these?
KS: I think we're using the
very weak levers that we have
as well as we can. Not just the
U.S., but also the other G8
countries that have said they
have stopped preparing for the
upcoming meetings in Sochi.

Canada, for example, has re
called its ambassador to Rus
sia.

Fhnnily enough, we cur
rently don't have an ambassa
dor to withdraw —he's here in
Palo Alto [referring to return
ing Stanford political science
professor Michael McFaul 'B6
M.A.'B6, who is leaving his
post], I think the bigger issue
here is cutting off assets to
wealthy Russians with bank
accounts in New York and
London, for example. That will
put some pressure on Putin to

negotiate or find an off-ramp.
We're not going to war
over the Ukraine. We're just
not going to do that. But I do
think that this will have years
if not possibly decades-long
ramifications in terms of
Russian relations with the
U.S. and Europe.

condensed and edited far
clarity.

da, perpetuation of stereo
types from 70 years ago. Ei
ther Putin is getting wrong in
formation about what is hap
pening or is wittingly spread
ing this. It's quite possible he's
just being given wrong infor
mation ... One of the terrible
ironies here is that the only
people to have died in this are
ethnic Ukrainians, shot on by
them own government two
weeks ago.
TSD: Does the United
States have an obligation or a
right to get involved?
KS: I think we, Europe and
NATO countries more gener
ally have an obligation. This is
pretty bald aggression, mili
tary aggression, on a sover
eign state. There is no U.N.
mandate that the Russians
had to go in. They had no di
rect evidence of violence that
they can show us or anyone
else that warrants this. It's
not even like Georgia, in 2008,
when Georgians had fired a
few shots before the Russians
went in. In this case, there is
nothing that can warrant
baldly grabbing Crimea from
the Ukraine.
The post hoc justification
that Putin is giving now is that
the legitimately elected presi
dent of Ukraine, Yanukovych,
was tossed out illegitimately,
in a coup. But that raises oth
er questions, like how
Yanukovych was ousted by an
elected Parliament on a unani
mous vote. He also chose to
flee. He walked away, saying
his life was under threat. Why
did he run away?
TSD: How do you think
the U.S. has handled the situa
tion so far? What can the U.S.
really do in situations like
these?
KS: I think we're using the
very weak levers that we have
as well as we can. Not just the
U.S., but also the other G8
countries that have said they
have stopped preparing for the
upcoming meetings in Sochi.

Canada, for example, has re
called its ambassador to Rus
sia.

Fhnnily enough, we cur
rently don't have an ambassa
dor to withdraw —he's here in
Palo Alto [referring to return
ing Stanford political science
professor Michael McFaul 'B6
M.A.'B6, who is leaving his
post], I think the bigger issue
here is cutting off assets to
wealthy Russians with bank
accounts in New York and
London, for example. That will
put some pressure on Putin to

negotiate or find an off-ramp.
We're not going to war
over the Ukraine. We're just
not going to do that. But I do
think that this will have years
if not possibly decades-long
ramifications in terms of
Russian relations with the
U.S. and Europe.

On Nov. 21,2013, thousands gathered at
Kiev's Maidan Nezalezhnosti demonstrat
ing against then-President Viktor
Yanukovych's suspension of policies that
brought Ukraine closer with the European
Union. For months, tensions in the former
Soviet republic have been building as two
opposing forces pull at the Ukraine, with
the European Union on one hand and Rus
sia on the other.
On Feb. 23, the deposed Yanukovych
fled Kiev for Russia.
This past weekend, Russian President
Vladimir Putin was given military authority
to intervene in Crimea, prompting swift

condemnations from the United States and
European governments. Reports suggest
that as many as 15,000 Russian troops have
been mobilized to the Ukraine.
To better understand the complex and
dynamic situation, The Daily spoke to
Kathryn Stoner, senior fellow at the FVee
man Spogli Institute (FSI) and an expert on
contemporary Russia.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What is the
nature of Russia's relationship with the
Ukraine, specifically, the Crimea region?
Kathryn Stoner (KS): Russia has a sev
eral-centuries long relationship with
Crimea Catherine the Great established
a warm water port there for Russia, Russi
a's only warm water port. Ethnic Russians

are actually the majority of the population
in Crimea, where there are also ethnic
Ukrainians and about 12 percent Crimean
Tatars.
TSD: How would you characterize the
current situation in Crimea? Is it an inva
sion?
KS: Crimea, for all intents and purpos
es, is now annexed to Russia. The govern
ment in Kiev would prefer that not be the
case and will obviously fight that, of course
it's not legal, there's absolutely nothing
in international law that says you can do
that. Crimea is a province of Ukraine, a part
of Ukraine.

TSD: There are prominent
reports in Russian media
about "armed people" in Kiev
promoting lawlessness. What's
your reaction?
KS: It's a lie. It's propagan
da, perpetuation of stereo
types from 70 years ago. Ei
ther Putin is getting wrong in
formation about what is hap
pening or is wittingly spread
ing this. It's quite possible he's
