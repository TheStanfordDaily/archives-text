# Q&A KATHRYNSTONER SENIOR FELLOW AT THE FREEMAN SPOGLI INSTITUTE
## 
### EDWARD NGAI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On Nov. 21,2013, thousands gathered at
Kiev's Maidan Nezalezhnosti demonstrat
ing against then-President Viktor
Yanukovych's suspension of policies that
brought Ukraine closer with the European
Union. For months, tensions in the former
Soviet republic have been building as two
opposing forces pull at the Ukraine, with
the European Union on one hand and Rus
sia on the other.
On Feb. 23, the deposed Yanukovych
fled Kiev for Russia.
This past weekend, Russian President
Vladimir Putin was given military authority
to intervene in Crimea, prompting swift

condemnations from the United States and
European governments. Reports suggest
that as many as 15,000 Russian troops have
been mobilized to the Ukraine.
To better understand the complex and
dynamic situation, The Daily spoke to
Kathryn Stoner, senior fellow at the FVee
man Spogli Institute (FSI) and an expert on
contemporary Russia.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What is the
nature of Russia's relationship with the
Ukraine, specifically, the Crimea region?
Kathryn Stoner (KS): Russia has a sev
eral-centuries long relationship with
Crimea Catherine the Great established
a warm water port there for Russia, Russi
a's only warm water port. Ethnic Russians

are actually the majority of the population
in Crimea, where there are also ethnic
Ukrainians and about 12 percent Crimean
Tatars.
TSD: How would you characterize the
current situation in Crimea? Is it an inva
sion?
KS: Crimea, for all intents and purpos
es, is now annexed to Russia. The govern
ment in Kiev would prefer that not be the
case and will obviously fight that, of course
it's not legal, there's absolutely nothing
in international law that says you can do
that. Crimea is a province of Ukraine, a part
of Ukraine.
