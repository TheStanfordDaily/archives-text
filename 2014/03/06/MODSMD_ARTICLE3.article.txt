## Notaro shines during comedy show 
### IRENE HSU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stand-up comedian Tig Notaro
performed last night in Cubberley
Auditorium to a full audience. Her
show featured audience interaction
towards the second half and was fol
lowed by a Q&A session moderated
by Dan Klein '9l, instructor of im
provisation.
"The show was a huge success,"
said Elizabeth Quinlan 'l3, events
coordinator for the Storytelling
Project. "I think there were people
laughing out loud every 10 seconds.
It was a rare and amazing moment
to have someone so well-known to be
interacting with the audience."
The event was in part sponsored
by the Stanford Arts Institute, al
lowing free admission for all mem
bers of the audience. The show was
co-hosted by Stanford Storytelling
Project and Immersion in the Arts:
Living in Culture (ITALIC).
ITALIC, a residential-based aca
demic program centered on the
practice, history and analysis of art,
brings in guest lecturers based on a

quarterly theme. This winter, ITAL
IC capped its quarter of speakers
with Notaro to conclude its theme of
"gravity and levity."
Aaron Shkuda, assistant director
of ITALIC, noted Notaro's unique
narrative style, relating it to the fo
cus of ITALIC this quarter.
"Throughout her comedy, Tig
takes a wry approach, dancing the
line between serious subjects and
humor," said Shkuda. "It's some
thing we've been focusing on all
quarter at what times is levity a
more effective way to create art that
deal with serious issues?"
Notaro's deadpan style first drew
acclaim at her 2012 Largo show in
Los Angeles, which she began by
greeting, "Good evening. Hello, I
have cancer."
At the time, she had just received
her diagnosis for breast cancer and
was dealing with Clostridium diffi
cile. She was also recovering from a
breakup, as well as from her moth
er's death.
"With humor, the equation is
tragedy plus time equals comedy,"
she had said at the 2012 Largo show.

"What was so remarkable about
that performance was that she was
in a tragedy stage and yet she
was still making comedy," said
Hilton Obenzinger, lecturer who
teaches a course called "Stand-Up
Comedy and the 'Great American
Joke' since 1945" in fall quarter.
Last night, her deadpan deliv
ery was no different, as she
brought up her double mastectomy
by joking about her breasts con
spiring against her.
Towards the end of the event, No
taro interacted heavily with the audi
ence, an action that Quinlan de
scribed as "a combination of excellent
craft and down-to-earth openness."
"She clearly wanted to have a dia
logue with the audience, but from my
perspective, people took too much
liberty with it," said Stuart Melton
'l5, co-president of Stanford's come
dy club, Stand Up, D.
Melton, who also hosts and per
forms at open mics for Stand Up, D
at CoHo, felt that the interaction
may have thrown off her rhythm as
comedian.
"But she handled it extremely

well," he said. "It was very interest
ing to see how she dealt with the
crowd."
"Tig turned it into her own per
formance — it was brilliant," Oben
zinger said. "And part of what was so
brilliant was that a lot of it really
wasn't calculated. She clearly thrives
off audience interaction."
Near the end of her routine, No
taro was able to cajole a standing
ovation.
"Every comedy show I've done,

I've gotten a standing ovation," she
had said during the show.
The audience laughed and 15
minutes later, obliged.
"Someone else asking for a
standing ovation would just seem ar
rogant," Obenzinger said. "Tig doing
it works. She has a self-deprecating
manner, and she comes off as being
very genuine."

breakup, as well as from her moth
er's death.
"With humor, the equation is
tragedy plus time equals comedy,"
she had said at the 2012 Largo show.

"What was so remarkable about
that performance was that she was
in a tragedy stage and yet she
was still making comedy," said
Hilton Obenzinger, lecturer who
teaches a course called "Stand-Up
Comedy and the 'Great American
Joke' since 1945" in fall quarter.
Last night, her deadpan deliv
ery was no different, as she
brought up her double mastectomy
by joking about her breasts con
spiring against her.
Towards the end of the event, No
taro interacted heavily with the audi
ence, an action that Quinlan de
scribed as "a combination of excellent
craft and down-to-earth openness."
"She clearly wanted to have a dia
logue with the audience, but from my
perspective, people took too much
liberty with it," said Stuart Melton
'l5, co-president of Stanford's come
dy club, Stand Up, D.
Melton, who also hosts and per
forms at open mics for Stand Up, D
at CoHo, felt that the interaction
may have thrown off her rhythm as
comedian.
"But she handled it extremely

well," he said. "It was very interest
ing to see how she dealt with the
crowd."
"Tig turned it into her own per
formance — it was brilliant," Oben
zinger said. "And part of what was so
brilliant was that a lot of it really
wasn't calculated. She clearly thrives
off audience interaction."
Near the end of her routine, No
taro was able to cajole a standing
ovation.
"Every comedy show I've done,

I've gotten a standing ovation," she
had said during the show.
The audience laughed and 15
minutes later, obliged.
"Someone else asking for a
standing ovation would just seem ar
rogant," Obenzinger said. "Tig doing
it works. She has a self-deprecating
manner, and she comes off as being
very genuine."
