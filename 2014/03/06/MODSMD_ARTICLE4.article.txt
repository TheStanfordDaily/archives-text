# FRESH INTO THE FIRE
## A
						LOOK AT STANFORD'S HISTORIC FRESHMAN STARTING PITCHERS 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
When Stanford baseball head coach Mark Marquess
last started a freshman pitcher on Opening Day, the
Soviet Union still existed, Electronic Arts remained
months away from releasing its first version of the
Madden Football video game and none of the play
ers on Stanford baseball's current roster had been born.

Future five-time MLB All-Star Mike Mussina took
the mound on that day for Stanford as a freshman in
1 1988, a year in which Stanford would eventually win
' the national championship. From 1989 to 2013, soph-

omores, juniors and seniors manned the starting pitch
er's role on Opening Day, but never a freshman. In the
first 37 years of Marquess' reign, freshmen pitchers had never even
started any of the first three games of the season.
Consider that streak completely obliterated.
This season, Stanford has deployed four freshmen pitchers that
have started the first twelve games for the Cardinal a streak that
has covered every game so far this season and doesn't appear to be
ending anytime soon.
Freshman pitchers Cal Quantrill, Brett Hanewich, Chris Yiall and
Tyler Thorne compose a four-man rotation that has made all 12 starts,
compiling a combined 4-4 record with a 4.01 ERA in 55.2 innings
pitched. Thorne has also made four appearances out of the bullpen
and has assumed a mix of a spot starter's and a reliever's role with
Quantrill, Hanewich and Viall having made all of the weekend starts.
