# FRESH INTO THE FIRE
## A 						LOOK AT STANFORD'S HISTORIC FRESHMAN STARTING PITCHERS 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
When Stanford baseball head coach Mark Marquess
last started a freshman pitcher on Opening Day, the
Soviet Union still existed, Electronic Arts remained
months away from releasing its first version of the
Madden Football video game and none of the play
ers on Stanford baseball's current roster had been born.

Future five-time MLB All-Star Mike Mussina took
the mound on that day for Stanford as a freshman in
1 1988, a year in which Stanford would eventually win
' the national championship. From 1989 to 2013, soph-

omores, juniors and seniors manned the starting pitch
er's role on Opening Day, but never a freshman. In the
first 37 years of Marquess' reign, freshmen pitchers had never even
started any of the first three games of the season.
Consider that streak completely obliterated.
This season, Stanford has deployed four freshmen pitchers that
have started the first twelve games for the Cardinal a streak that
has covered every game so far this season and doesn't appear to be
ending anytime soon.
Freshman pitchers Cal Quantrill, Brett Hanewich, Chris Yiall and
Tyler Thorne compose a four-man rotation that has made all 12 starts,
compiling a combined 4-4 record with a 4.01 ERA in 55.2 innings
pitched. Thorne has also made four appearances out of the bullpen
and has assumed a mix of a spot starter's and a reliever's role with
Quantrill, Hanewich and Viall having made all of the weekend starts.

"Everyone that I've
talked to always said the
same thing, that 'freshman
barely play, you'll be lucky to
play as a freshman,"'
Hanewich said. "That says a
lot about our pitching staff.
We're young but we're also
really talented."
It is likely that that what
the Cardinal has done is
completely unprecedented in
college baseball. No team
other than Stanford started
freshman pitchers in each of
its first two games this sea
son much less every
game. The rarity of fresh
man pitchers breaking into
the rotation made that first
moment on the mound even
more special and memorable
for each of the freshmen.

"It was pretty exciting, a
dream come true," said
Quantrill of his first start,
which came on Opening Day
against Rice. "I spent my
whole high school career
looking forward to that mo
ment when I'd first get to
pitch. Most people go into
college as freshman and get
a chance at the 'pen if they
do a good job. Three of us got
an opportunity right out of
the gate on opening weekend
to get a chance to start. It's a
blessing, I'm very thankful
for the opportunity and
hopefully we can make it
work this year."
However, the immediate
transition between pitching
in high school and pitching in
college didn't go exactly as
expected â€”at least right
away for each of the
freshmen. The first five
starts of the season resulted
in 14 earned runs allowed in
20.2 innings pitched for a
combined 6.10 ERA.

"I had a very quick real
ization that pitching in col

lege is much more based on
hitting spots and making
sure that you control the ball
within the zone rather than
just pumping up and throw
ing as hard as you can to get
strikes," Viall said. "You can
throw extremely hard but if
you are not able to place it
low and outside, low and in
side or drop an off-speed
pitch in for a strike, then you
are not going to succeed at
the collegiate level at
least not very much."
After shaking off the ear
ly season jitters, the starting
pitchers surrendered only 11
earned runs in 32.2 innings
pitched over the most recent
seven games of the season
for a 3.03 ERA. Quantrill,
Viall and Thorne each
recorded their first colle
giate victories during that
span. Not to be outdone,
Hanewich leads the three
weekend starters with a 2.70
ERA despite not yet having
picked up his first win.
"The past three weeks
have flown by, but I can al
ready see myself developing
as a pitcher and I'm feeling a
lot more confident when I go
out there," Hanewich said.
"I'm pitching instead of try
ing to be a thrower and blow
it by people."
Each pitcher brings his
unique talents and experi
ences to the starting rota
tion. Quantrill, who hails
from Ontario, Canada,
pitched three seasons with
18-under Team Canada, in
cluding appearances in two
18-under World Champi
onships and a silver medal in
the 2012 championship.
Hanewich possesses not only
talent on the mound but also
talent with the bat as a
switch hitter, no less after
having played at third base

for much of his high school
career. The 6-foot-9 Viall
throws a fastball that can top
out at or just above 95 mph.
In addition to having earned
numerous high school
awards, Thorne also won a
bronze medal in the 2007 Lit
tle League World Series.
"Just because we have
freshmen starters doesn't
mean we're going to have a
bad year from a pitching
standpoint," Hanewich said.
"I think where we are right
now, we've struggled a little
bit but we've also learned a
lot of things about ourselves,
which is going to help us in
the long run."
The added experience for
the freshmen stands to pay
dividends for the Cardinal
not only for the rest of the
season, but also for the next
several years. Due to MLB
draft eligibility rules, colle
giate baseball players cannot
be drafted until they com
plete their junior year or
they are 21 years old. Conse
quently, Stanford could po
tentially use the same start
ing rotation for the next
three or even four years,
producing the kind of experi
enced group that tends to be
the foundation of champi
onship-contending teams.
But for now, the focus for the
freshmen remains solely on
continuing to perform well
and validating Marquess' de
cision to start them.

"I know my spot is never
going to be set; it's always
going to be earned,"
Hanewich said. "Every sin
gle time I go out there, I feel
like I have somewhere to im
prove so that I can pitch an
other day."
