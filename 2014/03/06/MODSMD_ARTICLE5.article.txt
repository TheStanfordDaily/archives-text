## GSB holds conference on new age media 
### NITISH KULKARNI DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness' Arts, Media and Entertainment
Club, along with the Graduate School of
Business, hosted their annual Future of
the Media Conference at the Knight Man
agement Center yesterday, where two
keynote speakers and several panels dis
cussed the multi-platform nature of media
world.
The conference is centered on a differ
ent theme each year, with this year's event
focusing on the 're-reinvention' of the me
dia, explained Mike Hoffman MBA'I4, co
president of the GSB Arts, Media and En
tertainment Club and co-chair of the con
ference.
"[The conference] was actually started
by one of our keynote speakers last year,
Hunter Walk, who was formerly director
of product at You Tube and now heads a
seed-stage venture capitalist fund called
Homebrew," said Jonathan Sherman-
Presser MBA 'l4, conference co-chair and
co-president of the Arts, Media and En
tertainment Club. "He founded it when he
was at the GSB, with some of his class
mates."

When selecting the panelists, the con
ference chairs focused on bringing in
speakers who were relevant to the digital
age of media.
"We were looking for people who were
on the cutting edge," Hoffman said.
"When it came to finding panelists, a lot of
them were at the forefront of
mobile or platforms."
The six chosen panels
centered on topics related to
the changing face of the
news business, ranging from
those about the future of tel
evision to those about media
in a "mobile-first world."
In one of these panels,
"Publishing Platforms in a
Post-Blog World," Josh
Quittner, editorial director
at Flipboard, talked about
the popularity of publica
tion models that allowed
writers to go directly to
their readers.
"For every good story
that is written, there are a
million people that want to
read it," he said, explaining
that the harder part of deliv
ering news was accurately
surfacing good content.
In the same panel, Ed
ward Lichty, head of corpo
rate development and strat
egy at Medium, talked about

new revenue models for
"new media" platforms, dis
cussing methods such as
brand participation, which
he argued was more effec
tive than blatant advertising.
The event also featured
an opening and closing
keynote by Chas Edwards,
co-founder of California
Sunday, Inc., and Todd

Yellin, vice president of
product innovation at Net
flix, respectively.
The conference is one of
the GSB's flagship events,
and it is the largest event
hosted by the Arts, Media,
and Entertainment Club, al
though Hoffman admitted
that the event was smaller
than those of previous years
part of his goal to move
the conference to a smaller
format.
Sherman-Presser ad
dressed the absence of
speakers from traditional
media houses at the media
related event.
"I don't necessarily think
it's a bias or trying to make a
particular point or any
thing," he said. "I think of it
more in terms of what's go
ing on that is really exciting
right now. It happens that
there is a lot of stuff going on
in technology media plat
forms, and so there is a lot of
thought about what was go
ing to happen with these
things in the future."
