## Former GSB student's degree revoked 
### â€” Andrew Vogeley 
Administrators at the Graduate School of
Business (GSB) announced Tuesday they
had rescinded their offer of degree to Math
ew Martoma, the S.A.C. Capital Advisors,
L.E (SAC) employee, who was recently con
victed of insider trading.
The move, which effectively revokes the
MBA Martoma received in 2003, is reported
by the Wall Street Journal to be the first time
the GSB has revoked a degree.
Martoma, before applying to Stanford,
was expelled from Harvard Law School in
1999 for altering his transcript.
University spokeswomen Barbara Buell
cited privacy laws in declining to comment on
Martoma's situation. She noted, however,
that the University has avenues for revoking
offers of admissions or degrees if a student
has falsified admissions materials.
The University sent Martoma a letter last
month inquiring about statements made on
his application, giving him an initial deadline
of two weeks to respond. After giving extend
ing his deadline by two weeks, Stanford re
voked his admission after receiving no re
sponse from Martoma or his legal team.
Martoma was convicted on Feb. 6 on insid
er trading charges for his role in illegal

trades that helped SAC avoid losses of $275
million.
