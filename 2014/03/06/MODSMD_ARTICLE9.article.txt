## Kinsler's comments crossed the line 
### Do-Hyoung Park 
There are two major factors
that have ensured that my
sanity has made it this far
into Volume 245 of The
Stanford Daily: fellow
night-owl and Managing Editor of
News Catherine Zaw's company and
ESPN's Sports Center playing on
endless loop into the wee hours of the
morning as I pull countless all
nighters in the office while trying (and
failing) to salvage this quarter's
grades.
Sports Center just repeats a one
hour long taping as the night rolls on,
meaning that night after night, the
soothing voices of Neil Everett and
Stan Verrett have become the stan
dard background as I struggle with
computer science. If nothing else, I
get ridiculously familial 1 with whatev
er happened in the world that night
and watch the Top Ten Plays of the
day more often than I'd like to count.
Hey, at least I'll never run out of col
umn ideas.
Thesday night (meaning Wednes
day morning, I guess), Batman Le-
Bron James and the Heat lost to the
Rockets. Okay that's great. The Flori
da Gators had their record for 3-point
ers in a game broken. Spectacular.
Ukraine's soccer team is still going to
play against the USA. Cool. Detroit
Tigers second baseman lan Kinsler is
making nasty comments at the
Rangers' front office. Oh, man.
Every time Sports Center looped
through its report about Kinsler's
veiy vocal dissatisfaction with the
front office of his former team, the
Texas Rangers, I got more and more
uncomfortable. Kinsler was a player
that I had always respected as a fan,
but seeing his comments about the
team that he had spent the first eight
years of his Major League career with
showed me a side of the guy that real
ly rubbed me the wrong way.
Kinsler reportedly spoke with ex
treme disdain to Rangers general
manager Jon Daniels, calling the GM a
"sleazeball" and saying, "I hope [the
Rangers] go 0-162.1 got friends and I
love my friends, but I hope they lose
their ass."
It was no secret that Kinsler and
the Rangers had their disagreements
during the final year or so of their re
lationship, especially in the wake of
the Michael Young trade and the ca
reer-long second baseman being
asked to switch positions to make
room for the highly-touted Jurickson
Profar in the Rangers' infield. Evi
dently it was the departure of former
team president Nolan Ryan after a
power struggle that pushed Kinsler
over the edge.
I can understand Kinsler's con
sternation, sure. But an active player
going out and making these scathing
comments is just juvenile and sinking
to a level not befitting to that of the
standards to which we hold our pro
fessional athletes.
We expect our athletes to be exam
ples and ambassadors, and for the
most part, they're good at doing that.
And we love them for it. Mariano
Rivera, Derek Jeter, David Ortiz and
others are respected as much as they
are (even by fans on both sides of the
rivalries) because they are careers
that have demonstrated class and pro
fessionalism throughout their careers.
Seattle fans and Stanford fans
love Richard Sherman because of
his ability to mix eloquent profession
alism (for the most part) off the field
with a fiery provocative aura on the
field fueled by the energy of the 12th
Man. I bring up Sherman because I
want to compare the circumstances of
the controversial comments that he
made with those of Kinsler, and why
the latter bothered me while the for
mer only served to entertain.
Sherman made his infamous
Michael Crabtree comments after he
had made a play that essentially
clinched the Seahawks the Super
Bowl after having gone one-on-one
with the 49ers wide receiver. He still
had adrenaline coursing through his
veins from one of the biggest plays of
his career to that point, and it was re
ally the tremendous energy of the mo
ment exploding out of the cornerback.
I can respect that.
However, Kinsler's comment
comes five months after his trade and
just a few days into spring training
with a new team. There's no moment
talking and it wasn't a response to a
provocative comment made that could
have incited him to speak in such a
way. The fact that he directs his anger
at his former team, saying that he
wishes that they will suffer a winless
season, exhibits a strong impulsive
ness and lack of restraint and just

makes it seem like he is lash
ing out but at a group that
didn't have much to do with
the dealings of the front office,
the main source of Kinsler's
anger. He later said that he
was joking, but come on. Who
makes a comment like that as
a jest, especially against a
team on which he knows es
sentially everybody after hav
ing spent the last year with
them?
And more importantly,
what does this say about
Kinsler's character to his
teammates and fans, both old
and new? He came up with a
hasty, unapologetic excuse af
ter inciting very public drama
with his incredibly childish
and thoughtless comments. To

his new teammates and fans in
Detroit, that just makes him
seem like a "me-first" player
that doesn't hold himself ac
countable for the decisions
that he makes. Who knows
when he'll be dissatisfied next
and make some scathing com
ments about the Tigers? What
if the trade for Kinsler will just
bring unwanted baggage to a
team that's trying to tune out
excuses as it tries to compete
for another pennant?
These events must also ru
in Kinsler's image in the eyes
of Rangers fans, for whom he
was a sparkplug and symbol in
the leadoff spot in the lineup
for so long before he left them
for the Motor City. If I, an in
dividual that feels pretty am
bivalent about the Rangers,
feel this way about Kinsler's
unprofessionalism, how must
they feel after having support
ed him as part of their team
a team that he evidently has

no problem trashing in the im
mediate wake of his departure
for these last eight sea
sons?

Bad move, lan Kinsler. I've
interviewed enough athletes
even down here at the colle
giate level to know that it's in
credibly important for ath
letes to control what they say
to the media to avoid inciting
such controversy (see:
Thomas, De' Anthony). If you
have a chip on your shoulder,
let it show on the field, not
through your comments.

It's difficult to say whether
Do-Hyoung Park is genuine
ly upset at Kinsler, or if the
vitriol flowing from this col
umn is just the sleep depri
vation talking. Elucidate to
him the countless benefits of
a good flight's sleep at
dparko27@stanford.edu and
Tweet at him. @clokyoung

Michael Crabtree comments after he
had made a play that essentially
clinched the Seahawks the Super
Bowl after having gone one-on-one
with the 49ers wide receiver. He still
had adrenaline coursing through his
veins from one of the biggest plays of
his career to that point, and it was re
ally the tremendous energy of the mo
ment exploding out of the cornerback.
I can respect that.
However, Kinsler's comment
comes five months after his trade and
just a few days into spring training
with a new team. There's no moment
talking and it wasn't a response to a
provocative comment made that could
have incited him to speak in such a
way. The fact that he directs his anger
at his former team, saying that he
wishes that they will suffer a winless
season, exhibits a strong impulsive
ness and lack of restraint and just

makes it seem like he is lash
ing out but at a group that
didn't have much to do with
the dealings of the front office,
the main source of Kinsler's
anger. He later said that he
was joking, but come on. Who
makes a comment like that as
a jest, especially against a
team on which he knows es
sentially everybody after hav
ing spent the last year with
them?
And more importantly,
what does this say about
Kinsler's character to his
teammates and fans, both old
and new? He came up with a
hasty, unapologetic excuse af
ter inciting very public drama
with his incredibly childish
and thoughtless comments. To

his new teammates and fans in
Detroit, that just makes him
seem like a "me-first" player
that doesn't hold himself ac
countable for the decisions
that he makes. Who knows
when he'll be dissatisfied next
and make some scathing com
ments about the Tigers? What
if the trade for Kinsler will just
bring unwanted baggage to a
team that's trying to tune out
excuses as it tries to compete
for another pennant?
These events must also ru
in Kinsler's image in the eyes
of Rangers fans, for whom he
was a sparkplug and symbol in
the leadoff spot in the lineup
for so long before he left them
for the Motor City. If I, an in
dividual that feels pretty am
bivalent about the Rangers,
feel this way about Kinsler's
unprofessionalism, how must
they feel after having support
ed him as part of their team
a team that he evidently has

no problem trashing in the im
mediate wake of his departure
for these last eight sea
sons?

Bad move, lan Kinsler. I've
interviewed enough athletes
even down here at the colle
giate level to know that it's in
credibly important for ath
letes to control what they say
to the media to avoid inciting
such controversy (see:
Thomas, De' Anthony). If you
have a chip on your shoulder,
let it show on the field, not
through your comments.

It's difficult to say whether
Do-Hyoung Park is genuine
ly upset at Kinsler, or if the
vitriol flowing from this col
umn is just the sleep depri
vation talking. Elucidate to
him the countless benefits of
a good flight's sleep at
dparko27@stanford.edu and
Tweet at him. @clokyoung

There are two major factors
that have ensured that my
sanity has made it this far
into Volume 245 of The
Stanford Daily: fellow
night-owl and Managing Editor of
News Catherine Zaw's company and
ESPN's Sports Center playing on
endless loop into the wee hours of the
morning as I pull countless all
nighters in the office while trying (and
failing) to salvage this quarter's
grades.
Sports Center just repeats a one
hour long taping as the night rolls on,
meaning that night after night, the
soothing voices of Neil Everett and
Stan Verrett have become the stan
dard background as I struggle with
computer science. If nothing else, I
get ridiculously familial 1 with whatev
er happened in the world that night
and watch the Top Ten Plays of the
day more often than I'd like to count.
Hey, at least I'll never run out of col
umn ideas.
Thesday night (meaning Wednes
day morning, I guess), Batman Le-
Bron James and the Heat lost to the
Rockets. Okay that's great. The Flori
da Gators had their record for 3-point
ers in a game broken. Spectacular.
Ukraine's soccer team is still going to
play against the USA. Cool. Detroit
Tigers second baseman lan Kinsler is
making nasty comments at the
Rangers' front office. Oh, man.
Every time Sports Center looped
through its report about Kinsler's
veiy vocal dissatisfaction with the
front office of his former team, the
Texas Rangers, I got more and more
uncomfortable. Kinsler was a player
that I had always respected as a fan,
but seeing his comments about the
team that he had spent the first eight
years of his Major League career with
showed me a side of the guy that real
ly rubbed me the wrong way.
Kinsler reportedly spoke with ex
treme disdain to Rangers general
manager Jon Daniels, calling the GM a
"sleazeball" and saying, "I hope [the
Rangers] go 0-162.1 got friends and I
love my friends, but I hope they lose
their ass."
It was no secret that Kinsler and
the Rangers had their disagreements
during the final year or so of their re
lationship, especially in the wake of
the Michael Young trade and the ca
reer-long second baseman being
asked to switch positions to make
room for the highly-touted Jurickson
Profar in the Rangers' infield. Evi
dently it was the departure of former
team president Nolan Ryan after a
power struggle that pushed Kinsler
over the edge.
I can understand Kinsler's con
sternation, sure. But an active player
going out and making these scathing
comments is just juvenile and sinking
to a level not befitting to that of the
standards to which we hold our pro
fessional athletes.
We expect our athletes to be exam
ples and ambassadors, and for the
most part, they're good at doing that.
And we love them for it. Mariano
Rivera, Derek Jeter, David Ortiz and
others are respected as much as they
are (even by fans on both sides of the
rivalries) because they are careers
that have demonstrated class and pro
fessionalism throughout their careers.
Seattle fans and Stanford fans
love Richard Sherman because of
his ability to mix eloquent profession
alism (for the most part) off the field
with a fiery provocative aura on the
field fueled by the energy of the 12th
Man. I bring up Sherman because I
want to compare the circumstances of
the controversial comments that he
made with those of Kinsler, and why
the latter bothered me while the for
mer only served to entertain.
