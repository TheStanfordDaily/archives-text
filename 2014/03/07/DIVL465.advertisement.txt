dents said they have used Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS). Reasons cited for using CAPS included the convenience of
an on-campus resource, the professional staff and the fact that it is
free for most students. However, students reported mixed experi
ences with CAPS only 52 percent of those students rated their
satisfaction with CAPS a four or a five on a five-point scale, with
five representing extremely satisfied and one representing ex
tremely unsatisfied.

441 wasn't satisfied with my experience at CAPS. I
thought the woman I saw was trying to give me a
cookie-cutter solution to my issue, which I saw to be
more complicated. However, I also saw the nutritionist
at Vaden and one of the psychiatrists, and both of them
were incredible. They were understanding, gave me
advice for day-to-day life and things on a broader scale
and were really interested in MY situation. They
helped me understand that I wasn't alone, but didn't
present an attitude of 'Oh, this happens to everyone,'
which was how I felt at CAPS 11
