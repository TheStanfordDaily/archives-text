# Embracing The Daily's Cardinal sin
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
The Stanford Daily are having an existen
tial crisis. Up is down. Left is right. Cal is
awesome. The word "Cardinal" is plural.
That's the decision that was handed
down earlier this week by the heads of
our sports and copy departments, the power-hun
gry Do-Hyoung Park and the rebellious Alice
Phillips, respectively. Up until Wednesday, our

sports section was filled
with elegant sentences
such as, "The Cardinal
hosts lowly Cal this Satur
day," and, "The Golden
Bears have no shot
against the Cardinal and
its vaunted defensive
front"; now, we're going
with, "The Cardinal host

lowly Cal this Saturday," and, "The Golden Bears
have no shot against the Cardinal and their vaunt
ed defensive front."
Say what you want about which sounds bet
ter, but for as long as anybody could remember,
we at The Daily have preferred the first version,
and for a simple reason. We all know that Stan
ford's official mascot is the color and not the bird,
and no matter what Brent Musburger may
scream, it's the singular "Cardinal" and not the
plural "Cardinals." That's why Stanford Athletics
and The Daily of yesteryear clung tightly to
that word's singularity.
Ever since I've been here, the rule has been
the source of by far the most common mistake by
our new sportswriters "the Cardinal sin," as
someone at the office aptly called it this week.
But it was always hard to blame those writers,
since in accordance with our beloved AP Style,
just about every major media outlet writing about
Stanford sports (except for the two outlets actual
ly housed on campus) did it that other way. Heck,
I even once fired off a snarky email to the ESPN
Pac-12 Blog asking them to correct their noun
verb agreement.
A few Daily sportswriters have been up in
arms about the change this week, but I feel like
it's my duty to whine publicly as this golden age
comes to an end. After all, I've had the conven-

tion hammered in over the
course of a book, 250 of my
own stories and hundreds more
that I've edited. This is cruel, al
most like replacing your grand
parents' spectacles with a pair
of Google Glass.

It was always cool to write
about the Cardinal as if it was a
single, looming behemoth,
ready to swing the might of its
19 Directors' Cups at anything
that stood in its path. Those
days are over, and that's the last
sentence in which I'll ever get
to use our team's name as a sin
gular noun. As I've grown to un
derstand in my time here, per
haps it's more realistic that I'll
be writing about the Cardinal as
if they were a collection of
unique, human individuals
of college students.
Is the change for the bet
ter? Probably. Does it bring The
Daily up to date with the rest of
the media world? Definitely.
Will it be easy for me to
swallow? Not at all. So for the
time being, as I begin to un
learn everything I held dear
over the last four years of my
life, I hope you accept my sin
cere apologies for every copy
error relating to "the Cardinal"
in tonight's paper.
They is all my fault.

After further review, the ruling on
the field of a style change is con
firmed. Joseph Beyda will be
charged with his third and final
timeout of the half. Tell him to
pick up his challenge flag at jbey
da@stanford.edu.

Is the change
for the better?
Probably.
