# Embracing The Daily's Cardinal sin

### Joseph Beyda 
The Stanford Daily are having an existen
tial crisis. Up is down. Left is right. Cal is
awesome. The word "Cardinal" is plural.
That's the decision that was handed
down earlier this week by the heads of
our sports and copy departments, the power-hun
gry Do-Hyoung Park and the rebellious Alice
Phillips, respectively. Up until Wednesday, our

sports section was filled

But it was always hard to blame those writers,
since in accordance with our beloved AP Style,
just about every major media outlet writing about
Stanford sports (except for the two outlets actual
ly housed on campus) did it that other way. Heck,
I even once fired off a snarky email to the ESPN
Pac-12 Blog asking them to correct their noun
verb agreement.
A few Daily sportswriters have been up in
arms about the change this week, but I feel like
it's my duty to whine publicly as this golden age
comes to an end. After all, I've had the conven-
