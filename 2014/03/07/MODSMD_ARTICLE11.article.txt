# Bats look to Way hot vs. Jayhawks
## Card seeks end to weekend woes 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Looking for its first series win of the sea
son, the Stanford baseball team (5-7) hosts
the upstart Kansas Jayhawks (11-1) for a
three-game set this weekend at Sunken Dia
mond. Stanford has dropped each of its
three series this season in a brutal early-sea
son non-conference schedule that has seen
it face No. 19 Rice, No. 18 Texas and No. 4
Vanderbilt.

Despite not ranking among the top 25
teams, the Jayhawks received votes in the
USA Today Coaches' Poll this week after
starting the season 9-0, only losing their first
game this past weekend. In contrast to the
Cardinal's tough schedule, the Jayhawks
have faced a relatively easy slate of oppo
nents â€” including two four-game series
against BYU and Houston Baptist and will
experience their first test of the season
against a traditional power this weekend
against Stanford.

Stanford enters the series after clinch
ing head coach Mark Marquess' 1,500 th ca
reer victory in an 11 -1 rout over Cal on Tues
day. The win improved Stanford to 3-0 in
midweek contests, but its 2-7 record on the
weekends has stained the start of the season
for a Cardinal team that cracked the presea
son top 25.
Freshmen Brett Hanewich, Chris Viall
and Cal Quantrill will take the mound for
Stanford this weekend as the Card continues
their streak of 12 straight games with fresh
man starting pitchers. The trio has combined
for a 2-4 record with a 4.79 ERA in 10 total
starts on the season. The freshmen have ex
perienced great success recently, though, as
Hanewich, Viall and Quantrill have allowed
only nine runs in their last six combined
starts, good for a 3.04 ERA in those outings.
The Cardinal pitching staff will face one
of its stiffest tests of the season at the plate,
as the Jayhawks rank fifth in the nation with
a .333 team batting average. Junior outfield
er and cleanup hitter Connor McKay leads
the Jayhawks with four home runs and ranks
second nationally with 19 RBIs on the year.
Junior shortstop Justin Protacio bats leadoff
for the Jayhawks and is hitting .364 on the
season. With an upperclassman-heavy lineup
(five of the six players with at least 10 starts
are upperclassmen), the Jayhawks return
veterans who played major roles in pro
pelling the team to a 34-25 record last year,
their first winning season since 2010.
The Jayhawks, much like Stanford, have
relied upon the same four pitchers to start
every game this season. However, unlike
Stanford, the Jayhawks' four starters are all
upperclassmen. Junior Drew Morovick leads
the starting rotation with a 3-0 record and a
1.56 ERA and senior Frank Duncan is not far
behind with a 2-0 record and a 2.31 ERA. The
Jayhawks have performed well this season in

Senior first baseman Danny Diekroeger (above) leads the Cardinal in on-base
percentage and will be a big factor for a Stanford offense that has been inconsistent at times.
