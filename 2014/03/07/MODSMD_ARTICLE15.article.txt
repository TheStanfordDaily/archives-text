## THEATER TAPS recalibrates Swan Lake 
### SEAN CHRISTOFFERSON 
A calming moisture levitated
in the cool air last Friday
evening as I locked up my
wet bike and headed to
wards the side entrance of
Memorial Auditorium. I
walked up a small set of stairs and
through a set of large wooden
doors into a small room packed
with people, all waiting expectant

Theater and Performance Studies
(TAPS) performance of Swan Lake
Recalibrated, as choreographed
by Alex Ketley.
Eyes darted and heads turned

muscles rippled under the pres

her brow furrowed in concert

members, some of whom were
still finding their seats.
After everyone had found a
spot, a soft hush fell over the
crowd. The lone dancer contin

form. Now, however, the audi

Our gazes focused on her, uni
fying us all through empathy
and attention. Seemingly mil
lions of miles away from the
crowded room where we had
made small talk only minutes
ago, we were joined by a larger
group of dancers, and the perform
ance began.
Abstract projections of color
ful light appeared on the suspend
ed screen. The performers synced
in and out of corporeal patterns
stirring up waves of propriocep

before. At times it was as though
