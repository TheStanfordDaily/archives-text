## THEATER TAPS recalibrates Swan Lake 
### SEAN CHRISTOFFERSON 
A calming moisture levitated
in the cool air last Friday
evening as I locked up my
wet bike and headed to
wards the side entrance of
Memorial Auditorium. I
walked up a small set of stairs and
through a set of large wooden
doors into a small room packed
with people, all waiting expectant
ly for the doors to open to the
Theater and Performance Studies
(TAPS) performance of Swan Lake
Recalibrated, as choreographed
by Alex Ketley.
Eyes darted and heads turned
as the entrance to the perform
ance space was unsealed. Those
who had not already positioned
themselves as close to the doors
as possible quickly rose and made
their way in to claim the best seat
they could find on two sets of ris
ers that hugged the edge of a
large white square within which
the dancers would soon perform.
A long, amorphous, but roughly
rectangular projection screen
hung above the stage, resembling
a small cloud or a large piece of
crumpled up paper someone had
tried to spread back out.

As audience members

streamed in, a solitary dancer
made slow, concentrated move
ments across the floor. Her leg
muscles rippled under the pres
sure of her slowly shifting weight;
her brow furrowed in concert
with a form of transcendent med
itation. She was a million miles
away from the chattering crowd
members, some of whom were
still finding their seats.
After everyone had found a
spot, a soft hush fell over the
crowd. The lone dancer contin
ued her gradual flow from form to
form. Now, however, the audi
ence joined her in her trance.
Our gazes focused on her, uni
fying us all through empathy
and attention. Seemingly mil
lions of miles away from the
crowded room where we had
made small talk only minutes
ago, we were joined by a larger
group of dancers, and the perform
ance began.
Abstract projections of color
ful light appeared on the suspend
ed screen. The performers synced
in and out of corporeal patterns
stirring up waves of propriocep
tive sensation that I'd never felt
before. At times it was as though
I was being washed, cleansed by
the flowing forms whose seeming
weightlessness belied the physical
strain that created them. At oth
ers, I was pulled out of the percep
tion of my own body by a riptide of
intense, quick and almost violent
poses. These overpowering mo
ments were a welcome destruc
tion of the self, allowing the
calmer moments to provide a
sense of serene levitation.

At just under an hour, the per
formance went by in a heartbeat.
Afterward, I laughed at myself for
wanting to get the best seat possi
ble — for even thinking I could
identify the best seat. I got the

sense that I would have felt the
same extraordinary transforma
tions with my eyes closed.
Outside, the vapor in the air
had condensed into gently falling
raindrops. My hand rose without
my willing it and wiped the tiny
specks of moisture off the seat of
my bike. I unlocked the vessel from
its mooring, slowly lifted my leg
over the frame, and between the
pedaling that pushed my bike and I
through the sea of softly descend
ing droplets, glided all the way
home.
