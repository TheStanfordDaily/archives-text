## Students perform Tennessee Williams' "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" 
### ELIZABETH FAIR 
For her senior project for Stanford Theater and
Performance Studies (TAPS), producer and ac
tress Safiya Nygaard 'l4 chose to take on "Cat
on a Hot Tin Roof," Tennessee Williams' most
famous work. The production, directed by
Michael Hunter Ph.D. 'l3 and put on by the
Stanford Theater Laboratory in conjunction with the
Department of Theater & Performance Studies, pro
vides a good, if sometimes uneven, introduction to
the classic.

"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" tells the story of the Pol
litt family, which has gathered for the birthday of the
patriarch, Big Daddy (James Everett 'l3), on his
28,000-acre Mississippi plantation. Big Daddy is dy
ing of cancer, though he and his wife have been mis
led as to the results of medical tests and thus have a
more optimistic outlook. Brick (Max Walker-Silver
man 'l5), the younger son, and his wife, Maggie (Ny

gaard), center the play, as Williams examines compli
cated family dynamics and the despair and tenacity of
living life in American society. The play explores com
plicated, rich themes through this family at a critical
point, drawing out into the open their lies, deceit,
sexual tensions, love, avarice and fear.
The play is an actors' showcase: the action takes
place in one room, focusing the audience's attention
on the characters, their relationships, and most of all,
language. While the 1950s set by Katy Ferron 'l4
complete with a large bed smack in the middle of the
space and an old television set playing Disney car
toons that feature plenty of deceit and tricks is
beautiful in its detail, "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" hinges
instead on what the director calls "an incredible light
ness of language." Williams spins poetry of the Amer
ican vernacular. Lines like "smother her in minks and
choke her with diamonds" are rich and playful: a por-

trait of ownership and despera
tion but also a zest for life in a
few key phrases.

The focus on language and
talking to conceal and reveal pro
vides an incredible opportunity
but also a great burden for the
actors, who despite some un
evenness rise to the occasion.
When the play kicked off, the ac
tors seemed occasionally over
whelmed by all that they had
been asked to juggle. Accents
sometimes slipped, and it felt as
if the actors were rushing to get
through their lines. As the play
progressed, however, the actors
appeared to relax and feel more
comfortable in their skins. They
allowed the lines to unfold slow
ly, settling into the cadences of
Williams' lines and their South
ern drawls.

As the actors lost self-con
sciousness, the characters came
to life. The audience conse
quently became more invested
in their relationships and conver
sations, and the second and third
acts were engrossing as we
watch old relationships unravel
and new ones forged.

The actors did best when

playing out confrontational mo
ments with one another; Big
Mama (Raine Hoover 'll )'s at
tempts to reclaim her old posi
tion as the ground shifts be
neath her feet are particularly
affectingly played. Moreover,
Alison Valentine 'l6 as Mae is
perfectly cast and fully inhabits
her character, while Nygaard
does a fine job with a difficult
role.
