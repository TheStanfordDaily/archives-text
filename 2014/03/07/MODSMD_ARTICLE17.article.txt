I artist," explained Pulitzer
I Prize-winning playwright
I Lynn Nottage on Thursday
I afternoon in Pigott The-
I atre. Nottage appeared at
the event, during which she dis
cussed her work with Vice Provost of
Undergraduate Education Harry
Elam, as the Department of Theater
and Performance Studies' distin
guished guest.
Nottage said that she started
writing plays when she was five
years old. She traced her interest in
playwriting back to her grandmother,
an "extraordinary ordinary woman"
and an "amazing storyteller." It was

at her grandmother's kitchen table
that Nottage discovered spoken
word's power to breathe life into
memories.
Nottage went on to study play
writing at Brown University and
graduate from the Yale School of Dra
ma. She credited various mentors as
being central to her artistic develop
ment, including Paula Vogel, who
was the first female playwright Not
tage encountered. Vogel urged her
to commit to writing as a profession:
"You have a responsibility to do this,"
Nottage recalled Vogel telling her.
Nottage committed her career to in
terpreting and amplifying the untold
stories of culturally underrepresent
ed minorities.
Her plays, including 'Tabulation
or, the Re-Education of Undine and
Intimate Apparel," represent the ex
periences of African and African-
American women. Love serves as
the backbone of her narratives. Not
tage said that she self-identifies as a
"hopeless romantic," who writes
plays about "characters who, in com
ing to love themselves, are able to
love another."
Her most recent and Pulitzer
Prize-winning play, "Ruined", takes
place in the Democratic Republic of
Congo and tells the story of female
rape victims living in a brothel. Not
tage said that this play marks the first
time she was "driven out of rage to
write." In order to learn more about
civil war in Congo, Nottage traveled
to Eastern Africa, visiting Congo, Su
dan and Somalia. Inspired by inter
views with refugee women and for
mer soldiers, the play explores the
compromises that people make to
survive during wartime.

Nottage's current project is a "social
sculpture," a blending of site-specific art and
activism, which will depict the rise and fall of
Redding, Pennsylvania, one of America's poor-

est cities. As much as Nottage's career so far
has been mesmerizing and a substantive
contribution to the American theatrical canon
her work is clearly unfinished. Through her
eloquent commentary on where we've been
and where we are going, Lynn Nottage prom
ises to remain timelessly relevant.
