## Trouble in Paradise Confronting depression and suicide on Stanford's campus 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
This article discusses mental health, de
pression and suicide and may be trigger
ing to some people.

23 percent. That's how many Stan
ford students say they have considered at
tempting suicide. Three percent say they
have followed through and actually at
tempted it.

These are unscientific numbers, for
sure. They are drawn from a voluntary,
non-exclusive, online survey conducted
by The Daily. But over 500 people re
sponded, and so if these numbers are
even close to accurate, they paint a pic
ture of the struggles simmering under the
surface of life on the Farm.
This is not a "Stanford-has-a-mental
health-problem" article. The reality is that
depression and suicide affect everyone,
particularly young adults a recent
American College Health Assessment sur
vey found that nationwide, approximately
21 percent of college students have seri
ously considered suicide, very similar to
what The Daily found at Stanford. At
Penn, at least two students have commit
ted suicide since winter break. At Yale, a
student recently wrote a harrowing ac
count of her struggles with mental illness.
What this is, is a "Stanford-doesn't
nof-have-a-mental-health-problem" arti
cle. Time and time again, online and in
person, students have expressed the out
side perspective that because of the phys
ical beauty of Stanford's campus and ac
complished nature of the people on it,
Stanford students couldn't possibly have
mental health struggles.

"We at Stanford live in such a para
dise-seeming place that we begin to be
lieve that it is indeed a paradise, that Stan
ford's (and by extension, students') base

line should indeed be perfect," wrote a
current junior in response to the survey.

"There's a culture of 'we're the best
and everyone is SOOO happy,' which can
be toxic and alienating to someone who
doesn't feel that way," wrote a current
senior.

It should be stated outright: Stanford
students do struggle with mental health.
They do struggle with depression. They
do consider and attempt suicide. And
they often don't know where to turn.

Caitlin 'l6, whose name has been
changed to protect her privacy, was hos
pitalized twice last year for her struggles
with anorexia, bulimia and depression.
The first hospitalization during
the first week of school was by
choice. Needing additional help and not
knowing where else to go, Caitlin
checked herself into Stanford Hospital,
where she stayed for three days.
However, the second hospitalization
was not voluntary. After a period of self
harm and a missed meeting with her psy
chiatrist, Caitlin said that she was taken
in a police car from Vaden Health Center
to Stanford Hospital's involuntary psychi
atry ward for a five-day stay, something
she cited as one of the most traumatic
experiences she'd ever lived though.
"I tried to explain, but eventually I
was informed that I was going to the in
voluntary unit," she said. "I don't know
how to put this without making it seem
overly dramatic, but they basically kind
of told me that if I was nice, the police
wouldn't handcuff me."

Caitlin said that her peer health ed
ucator (PHE) and the residence dean
(RD) were supportive during her initial
hospitalization. After she was released
from the hospital, the University as
signed a team of mental health profes

sionals and University officials to support
her. While Caitlin appreciated the sup
port, she said the burden of constant
check-ins with her psychologist, psychia
trist, nutritionist and residence dean
added additional stress to her recovery
process.

"It was good of them, but at the
same time it just made me more stressed
out because I felt like I had to convince
everybody that I was on top of things and
meet with like four people every week,"
Caitlin said. "Every time they'd be look
ing at me like 'Are things okay [Caitlin],
are you okay?' and I just wanted to cry,
but I just had to be like 'l'm happy, I'm
happier than I've ever been in my life'
and so on because there was so much
pressure on me."

One current Stern resident assistant
(RA) said he was surprised by the
amount of mental health issues within
his dorm. He said that during his fresh
man year, he thought that most of his
peers were having a uniformly happy ex
perience.

"Now as an RA, we're in a position
where people do come to us for help and
do let us know about their concerns, and
so you see all that's going on under the sur
face," the RA said. "There's a lot. I think
it's a pretty fair statement to say that most
freshmen are dealing with some kind of
emotional or mental struggle."
All RAs interviewed were granted
anonymity to protect the privacy of their
residents.

"Based on my experience, I wouldn't
be shocked if it was at least one person
in every freshman dorm that has thought
about [suicide]," said another current
Stern RA.
