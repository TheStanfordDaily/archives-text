## Trouble in Paradise Confronting depression and suicide on Stanford's campus 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
This article discusses mental health, de
pression and suicide and may be trigger
ing to some people.

23 percent. That's how many Stan
ford students say they have considered at
tempting suicide. Three percent say they
have followed through and actually at
tempted it.

These are unscientific numbers, for
sure. They are drawn from a voluntary,
non-exclusive, online survey conducted
by The Daily. But over 500 people re
sponded, and so if these numbers are
even close to accurate, they paint a pic
ture of the struggles simmering under the
surface of life on the Farm.
This is not a "Stanford-has-a-mental
health-problem" article. The reality is that
depression and suicide affect everyone,
particularly young adults a recent
American College Health Assessment sur
vey found that nationwide, approximately
21 percent of college students have seri
ously considered suicide, very similar to
what The Daily found at Stanford. At
Penn, at least two students have commit
ted suicide since winter break. At Yale, a
student recently wrote a harrowing ac
count of her struggles with mental illness.
What this is, is a "Stanford-doesn't
nof-have-a-mental-health-problem" arti
cle. Time and time again, online and in
person, students have expressed the out
side perspective that because of the phys
ical beauty of Stanford's campus and ac
complished nature of the people on it,
Stanford students couldn't possibly have
mental health struggles.

"We at Stanford live in such a para
dise-seeming place that we begin to be
lieve that it is indeed a paradise, that Stan
ford's (and by extension, students') base

line should indeed be perfect," wrote a
current junior in response to the survey.

"There's a culture of 'we're the best
and everyone is SOOO happy,' which can
be toxic and alienating to someone who
doesn't feel that way," wrote a current
senior.

It should be stated outright: Stanford
students do struggle with mental health.
They do struggle with depression. They
do consider and attempt suicide. And
they often don't know where to turn.

Caitlin 'l6, whose name has been
changed to protect her privacy, was hos
pitalized twice last year for her struggles
with anorexia, bulimia and depression.
The first hospitalization during
the first week of school was by
choice. Needing additional help and not
knowing where else to go, Caitlin
checked herself into Stanford Hospital,
where she stayed for three days.
However, the second hospitalization
was not voluntary. After a period of self
harm and a missed meeting with her psy
chiatrist, Caitlin said that she was taken
in a police car from Vaden Health Center
to Stanford Hospital's involuntary psychi
atry ward for a five-day stay, something
she cited as one of the most traumatic
experiences she'd ever lived though.
"I tried to explain, but eventually I
was informed that I was going to the in
voluntary unit," she said. "I don't know
how to put this without making it seem
overly dramatic, but they basically kind
of told me that if I was nice, the police
wouldn't handcuff me."

Caitlin said that her peer health ed
ucator (PHE) and the residence dean
(RD) were supportive during her initial
hospitalization. After she was released
from the hospital, the University as
signed a team of mental health profes

sionals and University officials to support
her. While Caitlin appreciated the sup
port, she said the burden of constant
check-ins with her psychologist, psychia
trist, nutritionist and residence dean
added additional stress to her recovery
process.

"It was good of them, but at the
same time it just made me more stressed
out because I felt like I had to convince
everybody that I was on top of things and
meet with like four people every week,"
Caitlin said. "Every time they'd be look
ing at me like 'Are things okay [Caitlin],
are you okay?' and I just wanted to cry,
but I just had to be like 'l'm happy, I'm
happier than I've ever been in my life'
and so on because there was so much
pressure on me."

One current Stern resident assistant
(RA) said he was surprised by the
amount of mental health issues within
his dorm. He said that during his fresh
man year, he thought that most of his
peers were having a uniformly happy ex
perience.

"Now as an RA, we're in a position
where people do come to us for help and
do let us know about their concerns, and
so you see all that's going on under the sur
face," the RA said. "There's a lot. I think
it's a pretty fair statement to say that most
freshmen are dealing with some kind of
emotional or mental struggle."
All RAs interviewed were granted
anonymity to protect the privacy of their
residents.

"Based on my experience, I wouldn't
be shocked if it was at least one person
in every freshman dorm that has thought
about [suicide]," said another current
Stern RA.
Indeed, three of five freshman dorm
staff members interviewed by The Daily
said a resident had expressed suicidal
thoughts to them already this year. They
also listed a litany of additional struggles
faced by freshmen: eating disorders,
homesickness, academic challenges, room
mate conflicts, depression and family is
sues at home.

Mental illness is a big focus of staff
training, during which future staffers learn
about, discuss and role-play potential sce
narios they may face in dorms.
"When they tell you about these
things in training, they make it seem like
it's an option you may deal with some
of these things," said a second Stern RA.
"It's not an option. You will be dealing with
everything."
RAs are also given training in the Ques
tion, Persuade, Refer (QPR) suicide preven
tion techniques. QPR training was intro
duced at Stanford in 2008 as one of the rec
ommendations of the Student Mental
Health and Well-Being Task Force Report.
Alejandro Martinez, senior associate di
rector of Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS), said that QPR was imple
mented to help the Stanford community
better respond to student crises. QPR relies
on asking people direct questions about
how they are feeling and what they are
dealing with at that moment in time, in
cluding asking whether they are consider
ing suicide.

"Sometimes we can see someone's dis
tress, but we have so much respect for peo
ple's privacy, or we think it's not our busi
ness and we don't want to intrude in
someone's lives, so we hold back," Mar
tinez explained. "So a program like [QPR]
shows us that it's probably a good idea to
sometimes cross that line and be a little
more intrusive, but potentially life-saving,
to another person."
"Most of the time when you ask people
directly about suicide, they are going to say
no," Martinez continued. "That's typical
it's not like every time you ask you're going
to get an affirmative answer. But you have
already raised the question and sometimes
people will say 'yes, I have been,' and that's
the time to pursue additional support for
that person."

Several RAs said that learning when to

seek outside help is emphasized heavily in
training.

"I think that maybe there are some
people who come in and think that by deal
ing with a mental health issue, you are try
ing to treat it that's not the case," said a
current Wilbur RA. "Even though you as an
RA want to completely serve and help your
residents, there also comes a point when
you are only trained so much."
For Stanford students, the next step is
often the hospital, CAPS or the RD, de
pending on the severity or immediacy of the
case.

According to John Giammalva, the res
idence dean for Wilbur Hall and the Cow
ell Cluster, it is not uncommon for each of
the seven residence deans to have at least
one of their students in the psychiatric
ward of the hospital.

Giammalva said that the most immedi
ate concern is always the student's safety.
Later, the residence dean will work with
CAPS, the student and the student's fami
ly to determine what and where treatment
would be most effective. Sometimes, that
involves leaving campus, which Giammalva
characterized as a difficult decision.
"No student ever wants to leave I
don't think I've ever come across a student
that really wanted to take time off," Gi
ammalva said. "But on the other hand, I
think that pretty much almost every single
student I've worked with, after they've
taken time off, has come back and said,
'yeah, I needed that.'"

Caitlin said she understood Stanford's
policy, although she thought that some
times it was over-enforced.

"It's well reasoned. You don't really
want someone who is suffering from a
mental illness to go to your school because
they're not going to be able to perform at
their prime," she explained. "That's not
good for the school or for the student, so
it was good of them."
Caitlin ultimately decided to take a
voluntary leave of absence during spring
quarter in order to receive more treat
ment, and plans to return next fall. Con
trary to the reported experiences at other
universities, however, she said she is "real
ly grateful" for the support Stanford of
fered her, particularly now that she is in
recovery.

"I feel that Stanford is a very much
more compassionate community than
many other colleges," she said.
"In my dealings with the whole
administration related to mental
health and leaving Stanford, to
me, it seems as if they cared more
about my individual case then
they would at say, Harvard and
Yale."

Despite the prevalence of
mental health issues on campus,
students reported difficulty stimu
lating conversation surrounding
the topic. Caitlin said that at the
time of her hospitalization, she
didn't know of any other students
who were going through the same
experience.

Hannah 'l4, who has been di
agnosed with depression, said that

people often don't understand
how mental health can affect stu
dents.
"Sometimes, I can't make my
self get up and go to class that
is not me being lazy, that is me
having a medical issue, and that
sounds dumb to people," Hannah
said. "[People] laugh at how much
I procrastinate or 'oh, you didn't
go to class'... they know [about
my depression], but they don't
make the connection."

Hannah, who asked to be
identified only by her first name,
said that even though students are
usually aware of mental health is
sues, they don't create safe spaces
to discuss them and are occasion
ally insensitive. She shared a re
cent experience of a classmate at
tempting to explain the complexi
ties of steel maven Andrew
Carnegie by saying that "he was
completely crazy, like he should

have been on pills or something."

"As someone who is on med
ication for mental health issues,
the idea of being equated with
someone who was a racist, clas
sist, old white man from the
1800s, the idea that that is the
perception of people who need
help for mental health issues is re
ally troubling to me," Hannah said.
Many students echoed the
idea that the topic of mental
health could benefit from in
creased discussion, either through
receiving more emphasis during
New Student Orientation and
awareness weeks or through regu
lar programming where people
could share their experiences and
thoughts.
"It's the kind of thing where
you just want to have conversa
tions about it," one Stern RA said.

"I think there's this stigma and
people don't talk about it. [You
hear], 'oh, someone went to
CAPS,' and all of a sudden you
think the person is going through a
mental crisis, but in reality, some
people just need to go to CAPS to
talk. I think that's a huge thing that
we can do at Stanford is break
down that stigma."

The current Wilbur RA said
that she thinks the way Stanford
students handle stress is un
healthy.

"It's kind of celebrated and
seen as a badge of honor how
stressed you are, how little sleep
you've had, how much coffee
you've been drinking, how many
units you're taking," she said.
"Very seldom do you see people
say, 'l'm in 14 units and I slept 10
hours and I'm loving it.'"

"That isn't celebrated and I
think we need to shift that culture
a little bit and just recognize that
stress is normal in the sense that it
will happen, but chronic stress is
not something that should be con
sidered normal," she added.

In recent years, Stanford, as
well as other universities, has ex

panded the support it offers stu
dents.
"Historically, if you had a psy
chiatric condition that impacted
your ability to be at Stanford, it
was kind of too bad for you
people were sad and concerned
but that was basically it," Martinez
said. "[Now], there is not only an
interest but a legal requirement
that we make reasonable accom
modations to people, so it's more
possible to be successful at Stan
ford even if you get challenged by
a psychiatric condition."
Martinez pointed to several
initiatives that have been intro
duced at Stanford in recent years,
such as the so-called "Happiness
class," or CAPS' new Stress-
Less@Stanford program, as well as
improvements like hiring more
staffers at CAPS and refining RA
training.

"Stanford has a very strong
commitment to move forward in
this direction," Martinez said. "It
has committed significant re
sources in the last, I would say six
years, to make sure that we are in
a better position to respond to this
increased overall commitment to
pay attention to our well-being."

The Wilbur RA said that it
would be helpful if mental health
were thought of in a positive,
proactive way instead of being
treated solely as a disease.
"[You can] ask students to re
flect on their own mental health,
just like daily check-ins... whether
it be through journaling or through
meditation or being outside," she
said. "I wish that Stanford did a
better job of supporting students
and figuring out what are those
healthy habits that I want to insti
tute now that can last forever."
Another Stern RA said that
while Stanford has a lot to offer, the
beautiful campus, brilliant admit
tees and award-winning professors
shouldn't be used to gloss over the
struggles that students face.

"There is a case to be made
for Stanford to highlight that stu
dents go through bad stuff, to
make other students know it's
okay," the RA said. "It would be
nice if Stanford made more of an
effort to highlight the fact that it's
not as pristine as they want it to be
seen."
