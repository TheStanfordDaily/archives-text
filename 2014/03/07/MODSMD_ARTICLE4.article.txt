# STUDENT LIFE
## Examining cultural stigmas Community centers approach mental health 
### MINNA XIAO DESK EDITOR 
Even as the treatment of student men
tal health and wellness continues to evolve
at Stanford, for many communities on cam
pus such dialogue goes beyond the typical
referral to Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS) or The Bridge Peer Coun
seling Center. For populations such as the
Asian-American and Native American com
munities, issues surrounding mental health
may be steeped in cultural stigmas and in

fluences, coloring the ways in which psy
chological health is addressed.
A code of silence
As a Vietnamese-American born to im
migrant parents, James Huynh 'l5 said that
he perceives a code of silence within the
Asian-American community surrounding
the issue of mental health.
"The big cultural stigma, for me at
least, is that we often sweep mental health
under the rug," he explained. "We don't
see it as something as serious as physical
health. If a family has someone who's suf
fering from depression or other mental
health illnesses, they try to keep that hid
den."
Huynh, who recently started using

CAPS after a buildup of stress became too
overwhelming, admitted his own tenden
cies to place his mental health on the back
burner, brushing off feelings of sadness and
stress with an 'l'll just deal with it, handle
it and move on' mentality.
"I didn't really recognize my own
needs," he said.
According to Huynh, his background
as a Vietnamese-American generates inter
nalized pressure to keep it together in or
der to eventually get a good job and support
his immigrant family. Because of this, he
said, he doesn't want to slow down.
When asked if his parents know that
he is using CAPS, Huynh said that it never


SAM GIRVIN/The Stanford Daily
occurred to him to tell them.
"I don't want to worry them
too much," he explained. "We like
to keep our problems to ourselves
... The East Asian concept of the
self is we do things to satisfy our
relationships with other people."
Diane Lee, a doctoral candi
date in the Graduate School of Ed
ucation who conducts research on
cultural stress and coping of Kore
ans and Korean-Americans, said
that although Asian-Americans may
go to family and friends to help

with mental health issues, seeking
formal or professional sources of
psychiatric services is where many
Asian-Americans draw the line.

"This becomes more of a prob
lem if they struggle with serious
mental health illnesses that require
medication or certain specialized
help like counseling," Lee said.
Addressing the stigma
That stigma has had a tangible
effect on campus. Asian-American
students tend to underutilize
CAPS' resources in comparison to
other populations, according to
Oliver Lin '93, a CAPS psychologist
who also teaches the course EDUC
193F: Psychological Weil-Being on

Campus: Asian American Perspec
tives.
Lin explained that the impact
of not seeking out professional
help is compounded by the mind
set that using such resources might
indicate some sort of perceived in
adequacy, weakness or flaw.
"I'm painting very broadly
here, but I think even the notion of
mental health as separate, distinct
and valid from physical health may
not be made," Lin said. "Mental
health issues are sometimes con
strued as being lazy or not disci
plined enough."
In 2007, the Asian American
Activities Center (A3C) created the
Asian American Health at Stanford

Initiative and conducted a survey
to gather information on views of
mental health among the Asian-
American community at Stanford.
Based on survey data, the A3C
launched its iLive series previ
ously known as the After Dark se
ries which seeks to foster open
dialogue about mental health with
in the context of the Asian-Ameri
can community.

The iLive series, which takes
the format of small group discus
sions led by a professional staff
member, most often a CAPS coun
selor, is specifically geared towards
addressing issues that Asian-Ameri
can students have identified as in
stigating the most stress. Some of
these include the model minority

myth, depression, body image, anx
iety and perfectionism.
Cindy Ng, associate dean of
students and director of the A3C,
noted that the iLive series serves a
dual purpose.
"It both addresses the topical
issue at hand but also allows stu
dents to connect with campus re
sources," Ng said. "Our center is a
safe space ... a more familiar set
ting for students to meet coun
selors for the first time and feel
comfortable enough with them to
pursue further one-on-one coun
seling if needed."
Within the Native American
community
Alfred Delena 'l5, a native Zu
ni who grew up on a rural reserva
tion of about 6,000 people in west
ern New Mexico, cited "historical
trauma" as one source of mental
health issues within the Native
American community.
"Our people have gone
through lot of historical trauma
from the cycles of assimilation, to
losing our culture and identity, to
being forced to accept the western
traditions," he said. "As a people,
we've had to deal with being re
moved off our lands and being
forced onto reservations, with our
constant battles with the federal
government to get either federal
recognition or gain back land we've
lost."

According to Delena, the sta

tistically high rates of unemploy
ment, violence, poverty, lack of ed
ucation among Native Americans,
as well as the greater prominence
of alcoholism on reservations, are
factors that lead to or exacerbate
underlying mental health issues
within the community.
"For me, it's definitely hard go
ing to a place like Stanford and hav
ing to carry all of that with me,"
Delena said. "I've also been
through a lot in my earlier years of
being bullied, and having to carry
all this baggage with me going into
a different context it's hard try
ing to find a balance at Stanford."
Natasha Daniels 'l6, a native
Alaskan whose family has a history
of mental health illnesses, asserted
that there is an expectation that
Native Americans should be men
tally strong given the oppression
that that community has gone
through.

Daniels has suffered from anx
iety and depression for the past six
to seven years of her life, but was
only actually diagnosed this year
with depression. She started seeing
a CAPS psychiatrist at the end of
fall quarter.

Both Delena and Daniels
stressed the importance of having
open mental health discussions
within both the Native American
community specifically and the
greater Stanford student popula
tion at large, as well as the need for
all students to be more accepting
and less wary of conversations
about mental health.
Creating safe spaces for conver
sation
To increase the accessibility of
mental health services, CAPS coun
selors hold office hours both
drop-in and by appointment at
the various community centers.
For Delena, having psycholo
gist Naomi Brown present at the
Native American Community Cen
ter (NACC) "is a real blessing." He
said that he felt uncomfortable
seeking help in the professional
context of CAPS and just wanted
someone to listen.
"Naomi is a CAPS counselor
but at the NACC, she calls herself
the 'wellness coach,'" he said. "I
prefer that kind of title because I
feel that we're more on equal plat
forms, and just having her be there
and be very empathetic is a great
comfort."

Delena credited Brown's pres
ence in the physical space of the
NACC, as opposed to Vaden, as
lessening the shame that he feels
in reaching out to people "and bur
dening them with [his] problems."
For Daniels, speaking up about
her depression during Muwekma
tah-Ruk's "Crossing the Line"
house activity this year was the first
time she opened up about her

mental health struggles in a public
setting. While Daniels said that the
responses from her peers were
generally supportive, she felt that
an overarching stigma against men
tal illness still prevails within the
Stanford community.
"Some people have a hard
time understanding that my de
pression is a biological thing, a
chemical imbalance," Daniels said.
"I've been told, 'Oh, what if you're
just suffering from something else,
like the stress of being here?' and
'Why don't you just pull yourself

out of it?'"
"I've experienced periods of
suicide ideation," she continued.
"My mental health issues are more
chronic and less temporary...
Sometimes you need professional
help or medication. Some people
don't understand that. People have
this idea that you can just pull your
self out of it. But that's not always
the case."
Daniels recalled a recent oc
currence in Muwekma in which
someone had flyered excerpts of an
article around the house that in
cluded the line "You are too
blessed to be stressed."
"I didn't agree with that,"
Daniels said. "I just want people to
know that you can be blessed and
stressed."

sources," Ng said. "Our center is a
safe space ... a more familiar set
ting for students to meet coun
selors for the first time and feel
comfortable enough with them to
pursue further one-on-one coun
seling if needed."
Within the Native American
community
Alfred Delena 'l5, a native Zu
ni who grew up on a rural reserva
tion of about 6,000 people in west
ern New Mexico, cited "historical
trauma" as one source of mental
health issues within the Native
American community.
"Our people have gone
through lot of historical trauma
from the cycles of assimilation, to
losing our culture and identity, to
being forced to accept the western
traditions," he said. "As a people,
we've had to deal with being re
moved off our lands and being
forced onto reservations, with our
constant battles with the federal
government to get either federal
recognition or gain back land we've
lost."

According to Delena, the sta

tistically high rates of unemploy
ment, violence, poverty, lack of ed
ucation among Native Americans,
as well as the greater prominence
of alcoholism on reservations, are
factors that lead to or exacerbate
underlying mental health issues
within the community.
"For me, it's definitely hard go
ing to a place like Stanford and hav
ing to carry all of that with me,"
Delena said. "I've also been
through a lot in my earlier years of
being bullied, and having to carry
all this baggage with me going into
a different context it's hard try
ing to find a balance at Stanford."
Natasha Daniels 'l6, a native
Alaskan whose family has a history
of mental health illnesses, asserted
that there is an expectation that
Native Americans should be men
tally strong given the oppression
that that community has gone
through.

Daniels has suffered from anx
iety and depression for the past six
to seven years of her life, but was
only actually diagnosed this year
with depression. She started seeing
a CAPS psychiatrist at the end of
fall quarter.

Both Delena and Daniels
stressed the importance of having
open mental health discussions
within both the Native American
community specifically and the
greater Stanford student popula
tion at large, as well as the need for
all students to be more accepting
and less wary of conversations
about mental health.
Creating safe spaces for conver
sation
To increase the accessibility of
mental health services, CAPS coun
selors hold office hours both
drop-in and by appointment at
the various community centers.
For Delena, having psycholo
gist Naomi Brown present at the
Native American Community Cen
ter (NACC) "is a real blessing." He
said that he felt uncomfortable
seeking help in the professional
context of CAPS and just wanted
someone to listen.
"Naomi is a CAPS counselor
but at the NACC, she calls herself
the 'wellness coach,'" he said. "I
prefer that kind of title because I
feel that we're more on equal plat
forms, and just having her be there
and be very empathetic is a great
comfort."

Delena credited Brown's pres
ence in the physical space of the
NACC, as opposed to Vaden, as
lessening the shame that he feels
in reaching out to people "and bur
dening them with [his] problems."
For Daniels, speaking up about
her depression during Muwekma
tah-Ruk's "Crossing the Line"
house activity this year was the first
time she opened up about her

mental health struggles in a public
setting. While Daniels said that the
responses from her peers were
generally supportive, she felt that
an overarching stigma against men
tal illness still prevails within the
Stanford community.
"Some people have a hard
time understanding that my de
pression is a biological thing, a
chemical imbalance," Daniels said.
"I've been told, 'Oh, what if you're
just suffering from something else,
like the stress of being here?' and
'Why don't you just pull yourself

out of it?'"
"I've experienced periods of
suicide ideation," she continued.
"My mental health issues are more
chronic and less temporary...
Sometimes you need professional
help or medication. Some people
don't understand that. People have
this idea that you can just pull your
self out of it. But that's not always
the case."
Daniels recalled a recent oc
currence in Muwekma in which
someone had flyered excerpts of an
article around the house that in
cluded the line "You are too
blessed to be stressed."
"I didn't agree with that,"
Daniels said. "I just want people to
know that you can be blessed and
stressed."

Being happy is
about being
sure of yourself.

Even as the treatment of student men
tal health and wellness continues to evolve
at Stanford, for many communities on cam
pus such dialogue goes beyond the typical
referral to Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS) or The Bridge Peer Coun
seling Center. For populations such as the
Asian-American and Native American com
munities, issues surrounding mental health
may be steeped in cultural stigmas and in

fluences, coloring the ways in which psy
chological health is addressed.
A code of silence
As a Vietnamese-American born to im
migrant parents, James Huynh 'l5 said that
he perceives a code of silence within the
Asian-American community surrounding
the issue of mental health.
"The big cultural stigma, for me at
least, is that we often sweep mental health
under the rug," he explained. "We don't
see it as something as serious as physical
health. If a family has someone who's suf
fering from depression or other mental
health illnesses, they try to keep that hid
den."
Huynh, who recently started using

CAPS after a buildup of stress became too
overwhelming, admitted his own tenden
cies to place his mental health on the back
burner, brushing off feelings of sadness and
stress with an 'l'll just deal with it, handle
it and move on' mentality.
"I didn't really recognize my own
needs," he said.
According to Huynh, his background
as a Vietnamese-American generates inter
nalized pressure to keep it together in or
der to eventually get a good job and support
his immigrant family. Because of this, he
said, he doesn't want to slow down.
When asked if his parents know that
he is using CAPS, Huynh said that it never


SAM GIRVIN/The Stanford Daily
occurred to him to tell them.
"I don't want to worry them
too much," he explained. "We like
to keep our problems to ourselves
... The East Asian concept of the
self is we do things to satisfy our
relationships with other people."
Diane Lee, a doctoral candi
date in the Graduate School of Ed
ucation who conducts research on
cultural stress and coping of Kore
ans and Korean-Americans, said
that although Asian-Americans may
go to family and friends to help

with mental health issues, seeking
formal or professional sources of
psychiatric services is where many
Asian-Americans draw the line.

"This becomes more of a prob
lem if they struggle with serious
mental health illnesses that require
medication or certain specialized
help like counseling," Lee said.
Addressing the stigma
That stigma has had a tangible
effect on campus. Asian-American
students tend to underutilize
CAPS' resources in comparison to
other populations, according to
Oliver Lin '93, a CAPS psychologist
who also teaches the course EDUC
193F: Psychological Weil-Being on

Campus: Asian American Perspec
tives.
Lin explained that the impact
of not seeking out professional
help is compounded by the mind
set that using such resources might
indicate some sort of perceived in
adequacy, weakness or flaw.
"I'm painting very broadly
here, but I think even the notion of
mental health as separate, distinct
and valid from physical health may
not be made," Lin said. "Mental
health issues are sometimes con
strued as being lazy or not disci
plined enough."
In 2007, the Asian American
Activities Center (A3C) created the
Asian American Health at Stanford

Initiative and conducted a survey
to gather information on views of
mental health among the Asian-
American community at Stanford.
Based on survey data, the A3C
launched its iLive series previ
ously known as the After Dark se
ries which seeks to foster open
dialogue about mental health with
in the context of the Asian-Ameri
can community.

The iLive series, which takes
the format of small group discus
sions led by a professional staff
member, most often a CAPS coun
selor, is specifically geared towards
addressing issues that Asian-Ameri
can students have identified as in
stigating the most stress. Some of
these include the model minority

myth, depression, body image, anx
iety and perfectionism.
Cindy Ng, associate dean of
students and director of the A3C,
noted that the iLive series serves a
dual purpose.
"It both addresses the topical
issue at hand but also allows stu
dents to connect with campus re
sources," Ng said. "Our center is a
safe space ... a more familiar set
ting for students to meet coun
selors for the first time and feel

currence in Muwekma in which
someone had flyered excerpts of an
article around the house that in
cluded the line "You are too
blessed to be stressed."
"I didn't agree with that,"
Daniels said. "I just want people to
know that you can be blessed and
stressed."

Being happy is

Even as the treatment of student men
tal health and wellness continues to evolve
at Stanford, for many communities on cam
pus such dialogue goes beyond the typical
referral to Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS) or The Bridge Peer Coun
seling Center. For populations such as the
Asian-American and Native American com
munities, issues surrounding mental health
may be steeped in cultural stigmas and in

fluences, coloring the ways in which psy
chological health is addressed.
A code of silence
As a Vietnamese-American born to im
migrant parents, James Huynh 'l5 said that
he perceives a code of silence within the
Asian-American community surrounding
the issue of mental health.
"The big cultural stigma, for me at
least, is that we often sweep mental health
under the rug," he explained. "We don't
see it as something as serious as physical
health. If a family has someone who's suf
fering from depression or other mental
health illnesses, they try to keep that hid
den."
Huynh, who recently started using

CAPS after a buildup of stress became too
overwhelming, admitted his own tenden
cies to place his mental health on the back
burner, brushing off feelings of sadness and
stress with an 'l'll just deal with it, handle
it and move on' mentality.
"I didn't really recognize my own
needs," he said.
According to Huynh, his background
as a Vietnamese-American generates inter
nalized pressure to keep it together in or
der to eventually get a good job and support
his immigrant family. Because of this, he
said, he doesn't want to slow down.
When asked if his parents know that
he is using CAPS, Huynh said that it never

occurred to him to tell them.
"I don't want to worry them
too much," he explained. "We like
to keep our problems to ourselves
... The East Asian concept of the
self is we do things to satisfy our
relationships with other people."
Diane Lee, a doctoral candi
date in the Graduate School of Ed
ucation who conducts research on
cultural stress and coping of Kore
ans and Korean-Americans, said
that although Asian-Americans may
go to family and friends to help

with mental health issues, seeking
formal or professional sources of
psychiatric services is where many
Asian-Americans draw the line.

"This becomes more of a prob
lem if they struggle with serious
mental health illnesses that require
medication or certain specialized
help like counseling," Lee said.
Addressing the stigma
That stigma has had a tangible
effect on campus. Asian-American
students tend to underutilize
CAPS' resources in comparison to
other populations, according to
Oliver Lin '93, a CAPS psychologist
who also teaches the course EDUC
193F: Psychological Weil-Being on

Campus: Asian American Perspec
tives.
Lin explained that the impact
of not seeking out professional
help is compounded by the mind
set that using such resources might
indicate some sort of perceived in
adequacy, weakness or flaw.
"I'm painting very broadly
here, but I think even the notion of
mental health as separate, distinct
and valid from physical health may
not be made," Lin said. "Mental
health issues are sometimes con
strued as being lazy or not disci
plined enough."
In 2007, the Asian American
Activities Center (A3C) created the
Asian American Health at Stanford

Initiative and conducted a survey
to gather information on views of
mental health among the Asian-
American community at Stanford.
Based on survey data, the A3C
launched its iLive series previ
ously known as the After Dark se
ries which seeks to foster open
dialogue about mental health with
in the context of the Asian-Ameri
can community.

The iLive series, which takes
the format of small group discus
sions led by a professional staff
member, most often a CAPS coun
selor, is specifically geared towards
addressing issues that Asian-Ameri
can students have identified as in
stigating the most stress. Some of
these include the model minority

myth, depression, body image, anx
iety and perfectionism.
Cindy Ng, associate dean of
students and director of the A3C,
noted that the iLive series serves a
dual purpose.
"It both addresses the topical
issue at hand but also allows stu
dents to connect with campus re
sources," Ng said. "Our center is a
safe space ... a more familiar set
ting for students to meet coun
selors for the first time and feel
comfortable enough with them to
pursue further one-on-one coun
seling if needed."
Within the Native American
community
Alfred Delena 'l5, a native Zu
ni who grew up on a rural reserva
tion of about 6,000 people in west
ern New Mexico, cited "historical
trauma" as one source of mental
health issues within the Native
American community.
"Our people have gone
through lot of historical trauma
from the cycles of assimilation, to
losing our culture and identity, to
being forced to accept the western
traditions," he said. "As a people,
we've had to deal with being re
moved off our lands and being
forced onto reservations, with our
constant battles with the federal
government to get either federal
recognition or gain back land we've
lost."

According to Delena, the sta

tistically high rates of unemploy
ment, violence, poverty, lack of ed
ucation among Native Americans,
as well as the greater prominence
of alcoholism on reservations, are
factors that lead to or exacerbate
underlying mental health issues
within the community.
"For me, it's definitely hard go
ing to a place like Stanford and hav
ing to carry all of that with me,"
Delena said. "I've also been
through a lot in my earlier years of
being bullied, and having to carry
all this baggage with me going into
a different context it's hard try
ing to find a balance at Stanford."
Natasha Daniels 'l6, a native
Alaskan whose family has a history
of mental health illnesses, asserted
that there is an expectation that
Native Americans should be men
tally strong given the oppression
that that community has gone
through.

Daniels has suffered from anx
iety and depression for the past six
to seven years of her life, but was
only actually diagnosed this year
with depression. She started seeing
a CAPS psychiatrist at the end of
fall quarter.

Both Delena and Daniels
stressed the importance of having
open mental health discussions
within both the Native American
community specifically and the
greater Stanford student popula
tion at large, as well as the need for
all students to be more accepting
and less wary of conversations
about mental health.
Creating safe spaces for conver
sation
To increase the accessibility of
mental health services, CAPS coun
selors hold office hours both
drop-in and by appointment at
the various community centers.
For Delena, having psycholo
gist Naomi Brown present at the
Native American Community Cen
ter (NACC) "is a real blessing." He
said that he felt uncomfortable
seeking help in the professional
context of CAPS and just wanted
someone to listen.
"Naomi is a CAPS counselor
but at the NACC, she calls herself
the 'wellness coach,'" he said. "I
prefer that kind of title because I
feel that we're more on equal plat
forms, and just having her be there
and be very empathetic is a great
comfort."

Delena credited Brown's pres
ence in the physical space of the
NACC, as opposed to Vaden, as
lessening the shame that he feels
in reaching out to people "and bur
dening them with [his] problems."
For Daniels, speaking up about
her depression during Muwekma
tah-Ruk's "Crossing the Line"
house activity this year was the first
time she opened up about her

mental health struggles in a public
setting. While Daniels said that the
responses from her peers were
generally supportive, she felt that
an overarching stigma against men
tal illness still prevails within the
Stanford community.
"Some people have a hard
time understanding that my de
pression is a biological thing, a
chemical imbalance," Daniels said.
"I've been told, 'Oh, what if you're
just suffering from something else,
like the stress of being here?' and
'Why don't you just pull yourself

out of it?'"
"I've experienced periods of
suicide ideation," she continued.
"My mental health issues are more
chronic and less temporary...
Sometimes you need professional
help or medication. Some people
don't understand that. People have
this idea that you can just pull your
self out of it. But that's not always
the case."
Daniels recalled a recent oc
currence in Muwekma in which
someone had flyered excerpts of an
article around the house that in
cluded the line "You are too
blessed to be stressed."
"I didn't agree with that,"
Daniels said. "I just want people to
know that you can be blessed and
stressed."
