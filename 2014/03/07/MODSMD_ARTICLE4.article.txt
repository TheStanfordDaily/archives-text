## Examining cultural stigmas Community centers approach mental health

Even as the treatment of student men

at Stanford, for many communities on cam

CAPS after a buildup of stress became too

his immigrant family. Because of this, he
said, he doesn't want to slow down.
When asked if his parents know that
