## Bringing resources together Comprehensive mental health website to launch 
### VANESSA OCHAVILLO DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
The Office of the Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs will soon consolidate current on
campus resources for mental health and well
being in an "attractive, student-friendly, up
dated" website, according to University ad
ministrators.

According to Associate Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Sally Dickson, who served as
co-director of the Mental Health and Well-Be
ing Task Force that recommended the web
site initiative, the website will be the first
comprehensive hub of mental health and well
being information at the University. Dickson
noted that the website became a priority after
the advisory board's members concluded that
the current system of vastly distributed servic
es was hard to navigate.
"In such a decentralized environment, it's
very hard to identify what are all the resources
around campus that address mental health and
well-being," Dickson said.
In response to increased awareness about
mental health issues, the University has also
pushed to increase the number of qualified
information sources. Ron Albucher, director
of Stanford's Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS) and director of the advisory
board, said that this "safety net" of more
trained staff in different areas of campus life
was built so that students could feel that "any
person is the right person to talk to about
mental health issues."

However, Albucher said that ensuring ac
cessibility to that network of sources remains
the priority.
"We realized that [the safety net] didn't
work as well when somebody is trying to
look on their own and they want to see
what's available on campus," he said.
The advisory board also found that stu
dents may not use that safety net effectively,
instead typically first seeking help from com
munity centers and residential staff, like res
ident assistants, peer health advisors and res
ident fellows.

"The question for us is, 'How can we
make sure that whoever is the first contact
with the student... knows where to go for
more help?'" Dickson said.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardman emphasized that the website
should offer a solution. He noted that the site
is expected to launch sometime in the fall of
the 2014-15 academic year.
"It's still surprising to me that there are
students who will say, 'I didn't even know we
had counseling or psychological services,"'
Boardman said. "Part of that is how we com

municate."
As part of its recommendation to devel
op a mental health and well-being website,
the board also suggested that its debut fea
ture effective outreach measures, with sug
gestions ranging from simply designing an
identifiable logo to linking the website to
Axess or the main Stanford website.
Given the breadth of issues that that stu
dents might face, from alcohol abuse to anx
iety, Dickson acknowledged that the board
might adhere to a "gap analysis," in which it
would identify areas that are in need of at
tention.
"Issues will change over time," Albucher
said. "There could be new challenges or new
problems that come up, and the role of the ad
visory board is to try and pick up on that early
in the process and make recommendations."
