# Feminism and the Wage Gap, Part II: Women, Society and the Workplace
## 
### Haley Sims 
In my last piece, I talked about the question of
pay disparities in the workforce, and pointed out
that countries with paid maternity leave often
have even greater pay disparities than countries
without it. Put simply, maternity leave is not a cure
all for gender issues. There are other underlying
factors that make the gender pay gap as large as it
is, most prominently family planning and organiza
tion.

But I'm not against paid maternity leave: With
paid leave, women could leave their job for a period
to care full time for their children and then, when
ready, return and go back to their job at full force.
This would prevent them from feeling guilty or os
tracized for seemingly choosing either their family
or their career. It might also play a role in whether
a mother or father will be the primary breadwinner
for a family, since a mother with children could con
tinue to be paid as if she was still working.
You may argue: "What if a man is making more
than his wife? Then obviously he should work full
time and his partner should care for their child."
Maybe so, but doing so would further feed into the
cycle of women earning less than men. If we be
lieve that if a man is earning more already, he
should work even more, then we should also be
lieve that his female counterpart would work less,
which means she will make less money. And so the
wage gap only increases. We have already estab
lished that most of this gap can be linked to quan
tifiable factors like occupational differences (i.e. a
disproportionate amount of women becoming nurs
es) and differences in the number of hours worked.
But this doesn't tell the whole story in
2000, an extensive study conducted by Cornell
economists Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn
found that when factors like work experience, edu
cation, race, occupation distribution and union cov
erage are controlled for, there still exists a 9% pay
difference. A more recent 2008 study found this
gap is more like 7%. What is this 7%?
Experts don't know and we might not be
able to know either. It is highly possible that some
discrimination against women does still exist in the
work force be it conscious or subconscious. But
I think we can safely assume that there is very little
gender-based discrimination overall, as such dis
crimination would only be a lawsuit waiting to hap-

pen for employers.
Let's say, however, for argument's sake that the
big issue is family status the decision of women
to leave their jobs to care for family members. Then
is the only way to close the pay gap for women to
stop having children? I think not. But there is clear
ly no easy solution here.

In order to close much of the wage gap, com
panies would have to be willing to work more coop
eratively with mothers, men and women might
both have to reduce their work hours to focus more
on their families, or there might need to be a shift
towards more men becoming the primary caregiver
for children.

I am a feminist I believe that men and
women should have equal opportunities and be
treated fairly in all ways that make sense. But in or
der to close this wage gap, it truly seems that by
and large what is needed is a shift in the way
women and men plan families and seek out work.
If women are subconsciously being prodded by ex
ternal factors to become homemakers when in a
vacuum they would not make that choice, then it's
not really their choice at all.

It needs to become more acceptable for moth
ers and fathers to equally split work and family du
ties. Capable companies should seek to work more
cooperatively with single parents to allow women
to dedicate as much time to their jobs as they would
like and seek promotion should they desire it as
well. And some women should rid themselves from
any fears that they might be judged harshly or un
fairly for placing importance on their job or seeking
to "climb the greasy pole," rather than focus entire
ly on a family.

Simple, right? Of course not. It's never easy to
change the way a group of people, or even a single
person, fundamentally thinks about themselves and
their actions. Do women even want this shift? Can
our economy support a different family and work
structure? Can fair cooperation exist between com
panies and struggling mothers? If the answer is no
to any of these questions as I suspect might be
the case then feminists like myself would be far
better off rallying behind another cause than the 7%
difference in wages.
