## Op-Ed A
						Golden Age of Mental Health 
### 
In the past six years, more has been
done to rectify the mental health
situation in American healthcare
than in the past six decades. Contrary
to popular belief, the historical
tragedies of mental health treatment
in America which include forced
lobotomies, long-term confinement in
prison-like state hospitals and a
plethora of quack remedies result
ed only partly from stigma, fear and
misunderstanding. The other key
causal factor was money: specifically,
the collective unwillingness of society
to fund addiction and mental illness
treatment at the same level as other
parts of the health care system.
For most of U.S. history, employ
ers did not provide adequate mental
health benefits in the insurance pack
ages they assembled for employees.
This wasn't a controversial policy:
most labor unions were quite happy
to trade "mental for dental" when
they negotiated fringe benefits. But
over time, more and more families
who were being destroyed by a loved
one's schizophrenia or alcoholism or
manic depression went through a sec
ond round of suffering when they dis
covered that their employer-based in
surance wouldn't pay for care.

These families made common
cause with other advocates to mount
a 12-year push for equal treatment,
which culminated in the 2008 Well
stone-Domenici Mental Health Parity
and Addiction Act. As a result of this
law, the more than 100 million Amer
icans who receive insurance through
large employers are now guaranteed
that their mental health-related bene

fits will be comparable to those for
the treatment of other disorders.

Also in 2008, a major effort to re
form Medicare passed, one that criti
cally included a little-noticed mental
health provision that just came into
full effect this year. Since its creation,
Medicare had covered 80% of all out
patient care except for mental health
and addiction treatment, only 50% of
which was covered. This extremely
high co-payment effectively prevent
ed many Medicare recipients from re
ceiving mental health care. Today,
however, the 50 million senior citi
zens and disabled persons who rely on
Medicare enjoy the same level of cov
erage for outpatient psychiatric care
as they do for all other types of med
ical treatment.
The 2010 Affordable Care Act is
even more transformative. The law al
lows a parent to keep their children
on family health insurance until the
age of 26, thereby fully covering the
age range in which almost all serious
mental illnesses and addictions begin.
Furthermore, the law defines insur
ance coverage for mental illness and
addiction care as "essential health
benefits." As a result, both the Medi
caid expansion and the private plans
sold on health exchanges all cover
care for psychiatric disorders at the
same level as other diseases. The De
partment of Health and Human Serv
ices estimates that over 60 million
Americans will receive improved men
tal health insurance coverage because
of the provisions of the ACA.
