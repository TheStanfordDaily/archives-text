## MEN'S BASKETBALL Tourney hopes on the line 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
With one regular season game left to
play, the 2013-14 rendition of the Stanford
men's basketball team finds itself in an un
familiar position, as it tries to secure the
program's first NCAA tournament bid since
2008.

The Cardinal (18-11, 9-8 Pac-12) have
lost three straight contests for the first
time this season, and those defeats could
not have come at a worse time. The losses
have dropped Stanford from third place in
the conference to a four-way tie for fifth,
and more importantly, severely jeopardized
the team's NCAA tournament chances.
Luckily for the Cardinal, they still have
time to make amends for their recent
struggles, and that must begin tomorrow
when the Utah Utes visit Maples Pavilion
for Senior Day.

One of the three teams tied with the
Cardinal for fifth place in the conference,
the Utes (20-9, 9-8) are trending in the op
posite direction as Stanford. Utah has won
three straight and six of its last eight, over
coming a slow 3-6 start during the first half
of the conference season. It posted its best
road victory of the season on Wednesday
night when it defeated Cal 63-59, showig
that the Cardinal needs to come prepared
if they hope to snap their current three
game losing streak.
With the Utes' strong performance
during the second half of the
conference season, Utah head
coach Larry Krystkowiak has
certainly entered into the con
versation for Pac-12 Coach of
the Year. Despite featuring just
one senior on the roster

and no academic seniors
amongst the team's top six
scorers the Utes have
surged back into the NCAA
tournament conversation with
their outstanding play down
the stretch.

Since a Jan. 12 defeat to
Washington State, Utah is 8-5
in conference play, and none of
its losses have come to any
team currently lower than
third in the conference stand
ings. The Utes have wins
against the likes of UCLA, Ari
zona State, Colorado and Cal
during that time period, and
pushed Arizona to the brink in
an overtime loss.

During its hot stretch,
Utah has been powered by all
everything Delon Wright, the
younger brother of current
Portland Trail Blazer Dorrell
Wright. The junior college
transfer is one of the most
well-rounded players in the
conference, as his averages of
16.2 points, 5.3 assists, 2.6
steals and 1.4 blocks lead the
Utes, while his 59.3 percent
shooting and 6.8 rebounds per
game each rank second on the
team.

Despite Wright's excellent
play thus far this season, the
Utes are not a one-man show.
Sophomore forward Jordan
Loveridge figures to draw the
attention of Stanford's Josh
Huestis when Utah is on of
fense. A Utah native, Loveridge
ranks second on the team in scor
ing 15.4 points per game and is
first in rebounding at 7.4 boards
per game.

Sophomore guard Bran
don Taylor is Utah's third and

final double-digit scorer at
10.8 points per game.
If the Cardinal are going
to salvage their season, Stan
ford is going to have to do a
better job of taking care of the
basketball. After 37 turnovers
in the team's past three games,
Johnny Dawkins' crew will be
searching for answers on the
offensive end of the floor
against a Utah squad that ranks
second in the conference in
scoring defense and third in the
conference in steals.
The renewed focus must
start with senior forward
Dwight Powell, Stanford's all
conference performer from a
season ago. Powell's struggles
over the past three games have
been most exemplary of the
team's problems, as he has ac
counted for 27 percent of Stan
ford's turnovers during that
stretch.

The second point of em
phasis that should help the Car
dinal get back on track will be
on the interior. Despite having
one of the largest front lines in
the conference with Powell,
Huestis and senior Stefan Nas
tic, the Cardinal have been out
rebounded by 17 total rebounds
over its past two games. That
led to too many second-chance
point opportunities for both Ari
zona and Colorado, points com
pounded with Stanford's
turnover problems that it simply
could not afford.

Stanford must also pro
duce an offensive threat be
sides junior guard Chasson
Randle, who accounted for 43
percent of Stanford's points on
Wednesday. That extra scoring
punch either needs to come
from Powell, Nastic or a mem
ber of Stanford's inconsistent
bench. No time like the pres
ent for seniors Robbie Lemons
and John Gage.
Tipoff at Maples is at 11:30
a.m., and the game will be tele
vised on Pac-12 Networks.

Senior forward Dwight Powell (above) hasn't had the season many Cardinal fans
expected, but if he can deliver on Saturday and in the Pac- 12 Tournament, Stanford
will likely book its first trip to the NCAA tourney in coach Johnny Dawkins' tenure.

expected, but if he can deliver on Saturday and in the Pac- 12 Tournament, Stanford
will likely book its first trip to the NCAA tourney in coach Johnny Dawkins' tenure.
With one regular season game left to
play, the 2013-14 rendition of the Stanford
men's basketball team finds itself in an un
familiar position, as it tries to secure the
program's first NCAA tournament bid since
2008.

The Cardinal (18-11, 9-8 Pac-12) have
lost three straight contests for the first
time this season, and those defeats could
not have come at a worse time. The losses
have dropped Stanford from third place in
the conference to a four-way tie for fifth,
and more importantly, severely jeopardized
the team's NCAA tournament chances.
Luckily for the Cardinal, they still have
time to make amends for their recent
struggles, and that must begin tomorrow
when the Utah Utes visit Maples Pavilion
for Senior Day.

One of the three teams tied with the
Cardinal for fifth place in the conference,
the Utes (20-9, 9-8) are trending in the op
posite direction as Stanford. Utah has won
three straight and six of its last eight, over
coming a slow 3-6 start during the first half
of the conference season. It posted its best
road victory of the season on Wednesday
night when it defeated Cal 63-59, showig
that the Cardinal needs to come prepared
if they hope to snap their current three
game losing streak.
With the Utes' strong performance
during the second half of the
conference season, Utah head
coach Larry Krystkowiak has
certainly entered into the con
versation for Pac-12 Coach of
the Year. Despite featuring just
one senior on the roster

and no academic seniors
amongst the team's top six
scorers the Utes have
surged back into the NCAA
tournament conversation with
their outstanding play down
the stretch.

Since a Jan. 12 defeat to
Washington State, Utah is 8-5
in conference play, and none of
its losses have come to any
team currently lower than
third in the conference stand
ings. The Utes have wins
against the likes of UCLA, Ari
zona State, Colorado and Cal
during that time period, and
pushed Arizona to the brink in
an overtime loss.

During its hot stretch,
Utah has been powered by all
everything Delon Wright, the
younger brother of current
Portland Trail Blazer Dorrell
Wright. The junior college
transfer is one of the most
well-rounded players in the
conference, as his averages of
16.2 points, 5.3 assists, 2.6
steals and 1.4 blocks lead the
Utes, while his 59.3 percent
shooting and 6.8 rebounds per
game each rank second on the
team.

Despite Wright's excellent
play thus far this season, the
Utes are not a one-man show.
Sophomore forward Jordan
Loveridge figures to draw the
attention of Stanford's Josh
Huestis when Utah is on of
fense. A Utah native, Loveridge
ranks second on the team in scor
ing 15.4 points per game and is
first in rebounding at 7.4 boards
per game.

Sophomore guard Bran
don Taylor is Utah's third and

final double-digit scorer at
10.8 points per game.
If the Cardinal are going
to salvage their season, Stan
ford is going to have to do a
better job of taking care of the
basketball. After 37 turnovers
in the team's past three games,
Johnny Dawkins' crew will be
searching for answers on the
offensive end of the floor
against a Utah squad that ranks
second in the conference in
scoring defense and third in the
conference in steals.
The renewed focus must
start with senior forward
Dwight Powell, Stanford's all
conference performer from a
season ago. Powell's struggles
over the past three games have
been most exemplary of the
team's problems, as he has ac
counted for 27 percent of Stan
ford's turnovers during that
stretch.

The second point of em
phasis that should help the Car
dinal get back on track will be
on the interior. Despite having
one of the largest front lines in
the conference with Powell,
Huestis and senior Stefan Nas
tic, the Cardinal have been out
rebounded by 17 total rebounds
over its past two games. That
led to too many second-chance
point opportunities for both Ari
zona and Colorado, points com
pounded with Stanford's
turnover problems that it simply
could not afford.

Stanford must also pro
duce an offensive threat be
sides junior guard Chasson
Randle, who accounted for 43
percent of Stanford's points on
Wednesday. That extra scoring
punch either needs to come
from Powell, Nastic or a mem
ber of Stanford's inconsistent
bench. No time like the pres
ent for seniors Robbie Lemons
and John Gage.
Tipoff at Maples is at 11:30
a.m., and the game will be tele
vised on Pac-12 Networks.
