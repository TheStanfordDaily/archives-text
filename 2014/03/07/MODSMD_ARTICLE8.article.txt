## MEN'S BASKETBALL Tourney hopes on the line 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
With one regular season game left to
play, the 2013-14 rendition of the Stanford
men's basketball team finds itself in an un
familiar position, as it tries to secure the
program's first NCAA tournament bid since
2008.

The Cardinal (18-11, 9-8 Pac-12) have
lost three straight contests for the first
time this season, and those defeats could
not have come at a worse time. The losses
have dropped Stanford from third place in
the conference to a four-way tie for fifth,
and more importantly, severely jeopardized
the team's NCAA tournament chances.
Luckily for the Cardinal, they still have
time to make amends for their recent
struggles, and that must begin tomorrow
when the Utah Utes visit Maples Pavilion
for Senior Day.

One of the three teams tied with the
Cardinal for fifth place in the conference,
the Utes (20-9, 9-8) are trending in the op
posite direction as Stanford. Utah has won
three straight and six of its last eight, over
coming a slow 3-6 start during the first half
of the conference season. It posted its best
road victory of the season on Wednesday
night when it defeated Cal 63-59, showig
that the Cardinal needs to come prepared
if they hope to snap their current three
game losing streak.
With the Utes' strong performance
