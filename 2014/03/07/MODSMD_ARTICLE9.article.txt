## Top-seeded Card begins play in Pac- 12 Tourney 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
The No. 4 Stanford women's basketball
team (28-2, 17-1 Pac-12) embarks on its post
season journey today, seeking a No. 1 seed in
the NCAA tournament and its first national
championship since 1992, as it takes on Col
orado in the quarterfinals of the Pac-12 Tour
nament.

"We've worked really hard all year to put
ourselves in the position to get a No. 1 seed
and we want to keep the most favorable route
in the NCAA tournament," said senior for
ward Chiney Ogwumike.
The Card captured their 14th consecu

look to win the double honor of the Pac-12
Tournament crown as well. With No. 9 seed
Colorado beating the 2013 Pac-12 Tourna

the tournament on Thursday, the Card will
take on the Buffs for the first time since Jan.

"We're more rested. We're very excited to go
up to Seattle ... Eighteen games is a long grind
and a lot of traveling and now we're going to
play three games for everything. We're ready
and we're going to play really well."
