# POSTSEASON PUSH
## Top-seeded Card begins play in Pac- 12 Tourney 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
The No. 4 Stanford women's basketball
team (28-2, 17-1 Pac-12) embarks on its post
season journey today, seeking a No. 1 seed in
the NCAA tournament and its first national
championship since 1992, as it takes on Col
orado in the quarterfinals of the Pac-12 Tour
nament.

"We've worked really hard all year to put
ourselves in the position to get a No. 1 seed
and we want to keep the most favorable route
in the NCAA tournament," said senior for
ward Chiney Ogwumike.
The Card captured their 14th consecu
tive Pac-12 conference title this season and
look to win the double honor of the Pac-12
Tournament crown as well. With No. 9 seed
Colorado beating the 2013 Pac-12 Tourna
ment runner-ups, UCLA, in the first round of
the tournament on Thursday, the Card will
take on the Buffs for the first time since Jan.
12.

Last season, head coach Tara VanDerveer
begged for contributions from the bench and
stronger leadership on the court from players
besides Ogwumike. This season's team has an
swered those pleas.

"I do think we have a lot more contribu
tions, a lot more depth," VanDerveer said.
"We're more rested. We're very excited to go
up to Seattle ... Eighteen games is a long grind
and a lot of traveling and now we're going to
play three games for everything. We're ready
and we're going to play really well."
In addition to the dominant play of Ogwu
mike â€”who has contributed an average of
27.0 points and 12.1 rebounds per game
junior point guard Amber Orrange has
stepped up considerably, averaging 10.1
points, 4.7 assists and 1.6 steals per game. Or
range has been the conductor of the Stanford
offense, pushing the ball in transition and
knocking down shots when needed most.
"When we play fast and have a really good
pace, we play well," Ogwumike said. "That

means that we're playing aggressive
ly because we want to set the mo
mentum for the game."
The freshmen have been in
strumental in setting the pace of the
game, both as starters and from the
bench, providing Orrange and fifth
year senior Mikaela Ruef with solid
time to rest. Lili Thompson has so
lidified her starting position as guard
and backup point guard, while class
mate Erica McCall has come in off
the bench to complement the dom
inant rebounding of Ruef and Og
wumike and to play aggressor. It was
against Colorado earlier in the sea
son that Karlie Samuelson proved
herself to be a threat from behind
the 3-point line (5-of-8 shooting
from 3) and in finishing at the bas
ket off of backdoor cuts.
"If our season was a year-long
season, we would keep progress
ing," Ogwumike said. "Our fresh
men are all maturing and affecting
our game now in great ways...
Those little things are going to be
big for us, having to play three
games in three days and into the
NCAA tournament."
Although Stanford had great
success in conference play this year,
falling only at Washington, the Pac
-12 teams have proved to be unpre
dictable in the standings and incon
sistent at times; the final conference
standings differ greatly from the pre
season polls. The biggest surprises
have been Oregon State, which rose
to the No. 3 seed in the tourna

ment, and Arizona State, which
broke the top 25 at the start of Pac
-12 play and has maintained that po
sition.

This season's unpredictability
has been due in large part to the
league's strong freshman class, in
cluding that of the Cardinal. But the
team that has benefited the most
from a new player is Washington,
which boasts Pac-12 Freshman of
the Year Kelsey Plum. Plum demon
strated how powerful a new player
can be to a team's lineup, becoming
one of the only players this year to
manage consecutive 20-point games
against the Card.
"It's hard to predict how well
freshmen are going to do in this
league; first of all, they're 18 years
old, and two, this league is really
tough and to come out and try to be
a good freshman is very difficult,"
said Pac-12 Networks analyst Tam
my Blackburn. "I thought she would
probably be shut down quicker than
she was and she just hasn't been,
and it speaks to her ability to adjust
to an elite level of play and that
bodes well for both her and for
Washington."
Another surprise in the Pac-12
this season was the inability of Col
orado to rally after losing leading
scorer and team leader Chucky Jef
fery to graduation last year. Project
ed to finish third in the Pac-12 at the
start of the season, the Buffs only
managed a No. 9 seed going into the
Pac-12 Tournament. Colorado will
have a chance to redeem its entire
season if it can force the upset over
Stanford, not an impossibility after
it gave the Card a tight game in
Boulder.

"[Colorado has] a really good
chance to go up to Seattle and do
some things because of the way
they've played the last five games,"
Blackburn said. "They're really look
ing more like the Colorado team
we've been waiting to see."
Against the Cardinal two
months ago, the Buffs trailed by as
many as 19 points in the second
half. However, they rallied late in
the game to make it a three-posses
sion game with only a minute to
play. Tight full-court pressure de
fense and double-digit scoring by
four players allowed the Buffs to
come back and give Stanford a close
game. With the continued dominant
play of former Pac-12 Freshman of
the Year Arielle Roberson, who
chipped in 19 points against the
Card, Colorado has the opportunity
to capitalize off its recent dominant
play and do some damage.
For Stanford, securing a No. 1
seed in the NCAA Tournament and
staying healthy remain the top goals
this weekend.

"We are not focusing on wins,
because when you're focusing on
wins you're putting a lot of pressure
on yourself," Ogwumike said. "I
think we're focusing on playing well
and playing hard and focusing on
every possession and just playing
well."

"It's not just the team that is
the best who wins the NCAA Tour
nament," she added, "but the team
playing the best at that time."
Tip-off against Colorado is at
noon in Seattle at Key Arena.
