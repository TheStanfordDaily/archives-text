# STUDENT LIFE
## Freshmen encouraged to socialize beyond dorm 
### VICTOR XU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The two sides of Stern Dining
start to flood with hungry students
by 12 p.m. each day. As the packed
dining hall settles down and the
freshmen find their seats, however,
a peculiar thing happens each
Stern dorm clusters together in
one group of tables, generally with
few students outside the dorm sit
ting with them.
This dining habit is just one
symptom of a major concern of stu
dents and administrators across
campus: that the freshman residen
tial structure may limit the first
year social experience to within the
dorm. As connections developed
during freshman year can often
form the basis of social circles for
the remaining three years and be
yond, organizations like the Office
of the Vice Provost for Undergrad
uate Education (VPUE) and Frosh
Council are especially interested in
investigating this problem, accord
ing to Robert Urstein, dean of
freshmen and undergraduate ad
vising.
"We kind of hear this anecdotal
ly a lot, that freshmen wish that
they would meet and get to know
more people in their class," he said.
"And the question is, how can that
happen?"

This year, administrators and
student groups have sought to facil
itate those interactions by setting
up more social events that bring
the Class of 2017 together. One
such event at the start of winter
quarter Frosh Winter Warm-
Up, which was hosted by Frosh
Council, Undergraduate Advising

and Research (UAR) and the De
partment of Athletics, Physical Ed
ucation and Recreation featured
activities from writing New Year's
resolutions to "speed-friending."
Frosh Winter Warm-Up re
placed an event held in prior years
called Mid-Year Convocation, a pro
gram in Memorial Auditorium
where upperclassmen described
their Stanford experiences. Ac
cording to organizers, Mid-Year
Convocation was considered to be
too passive, considering that a ma
jor goal for freshman events like
Frosh Formal, dorm mixers and
Light Up the Night has been to
maximize inter-dorm contact
among freshmen.

Frosh Council member Jessica
Tarn 'l7 emphasized, however, that
it isn't solely the responsibility of
administrative groups to facilitate
socializing outside of primary resi
dences and that freshmen must
take advantage of opportunities of
fered.
"I think there is room for im
provement," she said of Frosh
Council's winter events. "There's a
lot of on-the-surface conversation,
when a lot of people just want to
have an in-depth conversation. But,
I think on a more personal basis,
the best way to meet people is just
natural interactions, so we have
these events but people should re
ally take advantage of them. Just
do it in a natural way, not like you
'have' to meet these people."
Urstein echoed that sentiment,
noting that out-of-dorm relation
ships often occur organically
through mediums like clubs, activi-
ties and small classes like in
troductory seminars.
"Some of that [diversifi
cation] is going to come from
the activities you choose to
do," Urstein said. "Some of it
comes from taking risks and
branching out, even if that
means eating at the [Rin
conada] table instead of the
Otero table. Or, if you're in
Stern, it means going five
steps over to the other side
of the dining hall from the
Twain side and meeting
some of your classmates
from Larkin. I think people
are pretty welcoming to one
another, and it may be hard
and awkward to do that
sometimes, but branching
out is good."

Efforts to boost out-of
dorm connections may come
at the expense, however, of
dorm community-building,
given that freshmen dorm
staffs typically seek to ad
vance the latter by measures

like encouraging residents to
sit and dine together at the
beginning of the year.
According to Austin
Lewis 'l5, a residential assis
tant for Loro, community
building and out-of-dorm so
cializing are not necessarily
opposed but rather open to
being appropriately bal
anced.

"It's a give or take," he
said. "If for instance I had a
friend in Otero eating at
Wilbur sometime, I could
have them come over to
[Florence Moore Dining],
which makes it easier rather
than just having everyone
just go to one side and forget
the other [parts of campus],
I think it is possible but a lit
tle more difficult as a fresh
man just because you're still
trying to get your sense
here, and it's really easy to
stay in your dorm."
Tam emphasized the val
ue of finding that balance,
noting that while she has
some friends who are con
tent with remaining within
the dorm and others who are
never around, there is some
thing to be gained from both

a strong residential commu
nity and strong relationships
outside of the residence.

"The reason I really like
Stanford is because of the
people here, and I've found
that meeting people from
different dorms has given
me a lot of different opportu
nities and perspectives,"
Tam said. "I love the people
in my dorm, and I'm really
close to them, but at the
same time I like to have dif
ferent kinds of interactions
and meet different kinds of
people. The only way you
can do that is by meeting
people outside of your
dorm."
