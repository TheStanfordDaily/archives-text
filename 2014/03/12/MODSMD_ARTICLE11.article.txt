# STUDENT LIFE
## Flying TreeHouse performs for local kids 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
While the Flying Tree House
may have grown out of a simple de
sire to educate and entertain, mem
bers of Stanford's combo
teaching/theater/comedy club have
sought to do something more in
their shows to promote creativi
ty and imagination in an age of
standardized tests and common
curriculums.
The club has its roots in a 2011
class taught by both Dan Klein
MBA '75, lecturer in drama and at
the Graduate School of Business,
and Lisa Barker Ph.D.'l2, a gradu
ate student at the School of Educa
tion at the time. The class was
based on Barker's experiences with
Northwestern University's Grif
fin's Tale club.

Flying Tree House offers ele
mentary school classrooms creativ
ity workshops, in which group
members teach kids the different
components to telling a story.
Director Allie Fijolek 'l4 ex
plained that members normally
start by teaching different story
frameworks but also instruct the
students on many other topics, such
as dialogue.
"[We ask the kids] what's the
setting, who are the characters and
what do they say to one another,"
Fijolek said.
According to co-director Will
Setrakian 'l5, the workshops are

ultimately intended to get kids into
writing gimps and act out what
they wrote in front of their friends.
The Flying Tree House program
extends, however, past the work
shops. After the kids write the
scripts, the group members will
perform them at the schools after
adapting the individual scripts and
weaving them together into a cohe
sive narrative.
"We don't want to constrain the
kids' writings or our adaptations of
the stories," said co-director Chris
tian Murphy 'l4, explaining that
sometimes they might take stories
word for word and other times they
might take elements of stories and
write their own scripts from them.
So far, Flying Tree House has
delivered workshops and perform
ances at Escondido Elementary
School and East Palo Alto Charter
School, which offers a diverse expe
rience for the team members, ac
cording to Murphy.
"[The schools] are different en
vironments so I think it's helpful
for us to see that," he said. "It of
fers us different material and kids
can take something different out of
the program. As we grow we can
probably expand to more schools
but I think that our connection to
both of these schools is really en
riching and gratifying."
The club's reputation has grown
quickly among local elementary
students. According to Fijolek, sec
ond graders badger their older sib

lings who have participated in the
workshops for information about
the program.
Fijolek also noted that one of
the participants had enjoyed writ
ing for Flying Tree House so much
that he eventually wrote his own
book.

Flying Tree House members
take on a new challenge, however,
when they perform the kids' shows
for Stanford students.

Although they often laugh at
different things, according to Se
trakian, Stanford students still ap
preciate the humor in the kids'
writing.
"They [Stanford students] re
acted just as well to us and were
able to connect with what we were
doing and what the kids were writ
ing," Setrakian said. "After all, they
are kids, too."
Ultimately, it's that ability to tap
into their inner child that motivates
many of the members of Flying
Tree House, according to Oriekose
Idah 'l5, a member of the club.
"I think what I get out of it is re
alizing that there is such untapped
intelligence in children that I forgot
I had as a kid," Idah said. "Even
when I'm performing, I feel like a
kid again. I'm doing all of these
crazy things on the stage but I
know that validating their imagina
tion is such a privilege."

the program.
Fijolek also noted that one of
the participants had enjoyed writ
ing for Flying Tree House so much
that he eventually wrote his own
book.

Flying Tree House members
take on a new challenge, however,
when they perform the kids' shows
for Stanford students.

Although they often laugh at
different things, according to Se
trakian, Stanford students still ap
preciate the humor in the kids'
writing.
"They [Stanford students] re
acted just as well to us and were
able to connect with what we were
doing and what the kids were writ
ing," Setrakian said. "After all, they
are kids, too."
Ultimately, it's that ability to tap
into their inner child that motivates
many of the members of Flying
Tree House, according to Oriekose
Idah 'l5, a member of the club.
"I think what I get out of it is re
alizing that there is such untapped
intelligence in children that I forgot
I had as a kid," Idah said. "Even
when I'm performing, I feel like a
kid again. I'm doing all of these
crazy things on the stage but I
know that validating their imagina
tion is such a privilege."
