## LETTER TO THE EDITOR The 						Placebo of the Medical-Government Complex 
### 
To the Editor:
The state of medicine de
scribed in "A Golden Age of
Mental Health," by Professor
Keith Humphreys (Opinions Sec
tion, March 7,2014), is deeply trou
bling. I do not mean this to suggest
we should return to a world of lo
botomies and institutions. But the
public policy-assisted expansion of
the mental health industry cannot
be used to show progress in soci
ety's health at large.

The philosopher Ivan Illieh
played provocateur in 1975 when he
asserted that the greatest threat to
health is, in fact, modern medicine.
Today, in the U.S. alone, hospital
associated infections contribute to
almost 100,000 deaths a year. But
the relationship between medicine
and illness becomes even more
worrying when discussing mental
health.

The last decade has seen an un
precedented expansion of the men
tal health-industrial complex, in
cluding exponential increases in
bipolar disorder diagnoses and the
official inclusion of dozens of ques
tionable diagnosable disorders like
"internet gaming disorder." Every
Stanford student, it seems, either
has an Adderall prescription or
knows someone who does.

Thanks to some of the policies
described by Dr. Humphreys, I
know that a lot more people who
need help are getting it. But in
stead of celebrating the forces that
make up the "public policy revolu
tion," I suggest that government is
the least credible candidate to lead

the mental health fight. The
scourge of corporate lobbyists that
pervades Washington is well-docu
mented: In 2008, the top recipients
of pharmaceutical industry dona
tions was a veritable who's who of
top Obamacare negotiators.
What used to be called growing
pains and mood swings are now
symptoms of ADHD and dizzying
arrays of prefix-modified
menopauses. Increasing numbers
of people consume an increasing
number of drugs to cure increas
ingly complicated, unobservable
ailments. It's hard to say that soci
ety is the biggest winner. We can
say, though, that the business of
mental health has never been more
profitable.

Is this the "golden age" of men
tal health? Or have we reached a
threshold of mental health medical
ization that is doing more harm
than good? Most importantly, does
society have the power to disrupt
industry-led, government-eomplicit
forces of mental health medicaliza
tion?

We know what Ivan Illich would
say. His Medical Nemesis, some
four decades old, is in hindsight
clearly avant-garde.
"A placebo Latin for 'I will,
please' pleases not only the pa
tient, but the administering physi
cian as well."
