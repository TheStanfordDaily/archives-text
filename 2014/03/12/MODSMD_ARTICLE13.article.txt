# Smoke, Mirrors and the SAT
## 
### Jason Willick 
Last week, hundreds of educa
tion professionals gathered
in an auditorium in Austin,
Texas, to watch as David Coleman
president of the College Board
and arguably the most powerful
man in American education un
veiled sweeping changes to the
SAT exam.

Coleman's polished, hour-long
address, titled "Delivering Oppor
tunity," was not what you would ex
pect from an education policy wonk.
Citing persistent inequalities in
American education, Coleman
made soaring appeals to justice and
opportunity with all the populist
fervor of an Elizabeth Warren cam
paign rally. At one point he called
the decorated historian Robert
Caro to the podium to read a mov
ing passage about Lyndon B. John
son's initiatives to ameliorate
poverty in the rural South.
The message was clear: The
SAT as currently designed is an
elitist exam, testing "obscure" vo

cabulary words and "tricky" math
problems that are irrelevant to col
lege success, and reinforcing "priv
ilege, rather than merit." The new
exam will therefore feature more
elementary vocabulary and more
straightforward math, among oth
er changes designed to make the
SAT less like an aptitude test and
more similar to high-school course
work. The College Board's eu
phemisms don't obscure the fact
that they intend to roll out an easier
test. As one critic observed, "when
the going gets tough, well, why not
just make the going easier?"
So far, the media has gone all-in
for Coleman. A widely circulated
New York Times Magazine story
waxed grandiose about the new
SAT, suggesting that it will level
the academic playing field, propel
students out of poverty and deal a
devastating blow to the test-prep
industry that helps rich students
raise their scores.
All of this sounds well and good.
Equality of opportunity a defin
ing feature of our national identity
since de Tocqueville —is clearly
not a reality for millions of Ameri
can high school students. But when
you look past the College Board's
smoke and mirrors, it is unclear
how the new SAT is supposed to
address this.

Coleman insists that "unequal
test prep access is a problem," and
he's right. But it's not a huge prob
lem most studies show that even
the most expensive courses only
raise scores by 15 points per 800-
point section, on average. Coleman
and the College Board are
adamant that the new test will be
even more difficult to "game," but
don't provide any statistical evi
dence for this claim. If anything,
many of the changes narrowing

the scope of the vocabulary tested,
making math questions more pre
dictable and less abstract, releas
ing the essay prompt (but not the
source material) in advance
would seem to give an even
greater advantage to students
who have experienced tutors at
their disposal.

It is also doubtful that the Col
lege Board's efforts to "align" the
test material with high-school
coursework will level the playing
field in any meaningful way. After
all, the roots of educational in
equality lie with schools, teachers
and parents. Students with educat
ed parents who attend well-funded
schools with top teachers will have
no problem succeeding at a test
based strictly on high-school cur
ricula. It might even be the case
that basing questions off of class
room instruction, rather than cog
nitive ability, will further tip the
scales against students who never
had high-quality teachers or a
classroom environment conducive
to learning.
The College Board's claim that
the new SAT will be a better pre
dictor of college performance
offered, once again, without much
in the way of evidence should al
so be viewed with skepticism. The
existing SAT is already nearly as
good a predictor of a student's col
lege performance as is the entire
high-school CPA, an impressive
feat for a three-hour test. And de
spite the fashionable idea that raw
talent doesn't matter, studies show
that SAT scores are linked to indi
cators of extraordinary achieve
ment— like the likelihood a per
son will secure a patent, publish a
literary work or earn a doctorate
that are relevant to college ad
missions decisions.
Some of the initiatives Coleman
announced, such as the College
Board's partnership with Khan
Academy to make free test prep
available to all and the expansion of
the College Board's voucher pro
gram for low-income students,
should be applauded. But the Col
lege Board has irresponsibly over
sold the benefits of the changes to
the test itself.

At a time when high school
grading standards are eroding and
fewer incoming college freshmen
are prepared to handle the course
material, a demanding standard
ized testing regime is more impor
tant than ever. We need a harder
SAT, not an easier one.

would seem to give an even
greater advantage to students
who have experienced tutors at
their disposal.

It is also doubtful that the Col
lege Board's efforts to "align" the
test material with high-school
coursework will level the playing
field in any meaningful way. After
all, the roots of educational in
equality lie with schools, teachers
and parents. Students with educat
ed parents who attend well-funded
schools with top teachers will have
no problem succeeding at a test
based strictly on high-school cur
ricula. It might even be the case
that basing questions off of class
room instruction, rather than cog
nitive ability, will further tip the
scales against students who never
had high-quality teachers or a
classroom environment conducive
to learning.
The College Board's claim that
the new SAT will be a better pre
dictor of college performance
offered, once again, without much
in the way of evidence should al
so be viewed with skepticism. The
existing SAT is already nearly as
good a predictor of a student's col
lege performance as is the entire
high-school CPA, an impressive
feat for a three-hour test. And de
spite the fashionable idea that raw
talent doesn't matter, studies show
that SAT scores are linked to indi
cators of extraordinary achieve
ment— like the likelihood a per
son will secure a patent, publish a
literary work or earn a doctorate
that are relevant to college ad
missions decisions.
Some of the initiatives Coleman
announced, such as the College
Board's partnership with Khan
Academy to make free test prep
available to all and the expansion of
the College Board's voucher pro
gram for low-income students,
should be applauded. But the Col
lege Board has irresponsibly over
sold the benefits of the changes to
the test itself.

At a time when high school
grading standards are eroding and
fewer incoming college freshmen
are prepared to handle the course
material, a demanding standard
ized testing regime is more impor
tant than ever. We need a harder
SAT, not an easier one.

Last week, hundreds of educa
tion professionals gathered
in an auditorium in Austin,
Texas, to watch as David Coleman
president of the College Board
and arguably the most powerful
man in American education un
veiled sweeping changes to the
SAT exam.

Coleman's polished, hour-long
address, titled "Delivering Oppor
tunity," was not what you would ex
pect from an education policy wonk.
Citing persistent inequalities in
American education, Coleman
made soaring appeals to justice and
opportunity with all the populist
fervor of an Elizabeth Warren cam
paign rally. At one point he called
the decorated historian Robert
Caro to the podium to read a mov
ing passage about Lyndon B. John
son's initiatives to ameliorate
poverty in the rural South.
The message was clear: The
SAT as currently designed is an
elitist exam, testing "obscure" vo

cabulary words and "tricky" math
problems that are irrelevant to col
lege success, and reinforcing "priv
ilege, rather than merit." The new
exam will therefore feature more
elementary vocabulary and more
straightforward math, among oth
er changes designed to make the
SAT less like an aptitude test and
more similar to high-school course
work. The College Board's eu
phemisms don't obscure the fact
that they intend to roll out an easier
test. As one critic observed, "when
the going gets tough, well, why not
just make the going easier?"
So far, the media has gone all-in
for Coleman. A widely circulated
New York Times Magazine story
waxed grandiose about the new
SAT, suggesting that it will level
the academic playing field, propel
students out of poverty and deal a
devastating blow to the test-prep
industry that helps rich students
raise their scores.
All of this sounds well and good.
Equality of opportunity a defin
ing feature of our national identity
since de Tocqueville —is clearly
not a reality for millions of Ameri
can high school students. But when
you look past the College Board's
smoke and mirrors, it is unclear
how the new SAT is supposed to
address this.

Coleman insists that "unequal
test prep access is a problem," and
he's right. But it's not a huge prob
lem most studies show that even
the most expensive courses only
raise scores by 15 points per 800-
point section, on average. Coleman
and the College Board are
adamant that the new test will be
even more difficult to "game," but
don't provide any statistical evi
dence for this claim. If anything,
many of the changes narrowing

the scope of the vocabulary tested,
making math questions more pre
dictable and less abstract, releas
ing the essay prompt (but not the
source material) in advance
would seem to give an even
greater advantage to students
who have experienced tutors at
their disposal.
