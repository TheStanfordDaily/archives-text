# Smoke, Mirrors and the SAT

### Jason Willick 
Last week, hundreds of educa
tion professionals gathered
in an auditorium in Austin,
Texas, to watch as David Coleman
president of the College Board
and arguably the most powerful
man in American education un
veiled sweeping changes to the
SAT exam.

Coleman's polished, hour-long
address, titled "Delivering Oppor
tunity," was not what you would ex
pect from an education policy wonk.
Citing persistent inequalities in
American education, Coleman
made soaring appeals to justice and
opportunity with all the populist
fervor of an Elizabeth Warren cam
paign rally. At one point he called
the decorated historian Robert
Caro to the podium to read a mov
ing passage about Lyndon B. John
son's initiatives to ameliorate
poverty in the rural South.
The message was clear: The
SAT as currently designed is an
elitist exam, testing "obscure" vo

cabulary words and "tricky" math
problems that are irrelevant to col
lege success, and reinforcing "priv
ilege, rather than merit." The new
exam will therefore feature more
elementary vocabulary and more
straightforward math, among oth
er changes designed to make the
SAT less like an aptitude test and
more similar to high-school course
work. The College Board's eu
phemisms don't obscure the fact
that they intend to roll out an easier
test. As one critic observed, "when
the going gets tough, well, why not
just make the going easier?"
So far, the media has gone all-in
for Coleman. A widely circulated
New York Times Magazine story
waxed grandiose about the new
SAT, suggesting that it will level
the academic playing field, propel
students out of poverty and deal a
devastating blow to the test-prep
industry that helps rich students
