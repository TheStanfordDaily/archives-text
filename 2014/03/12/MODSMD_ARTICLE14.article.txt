## Winter in Israel, Part III: The Challenge of Pluralism 
### Aly Cash, Jaih Hunter-Hill Amrita Rao 
This is the third in a series
of three articles written by
Aly Cash 'l6, Jaih
Hunter-Hill 'l5 and Amrita
Rao 'l5 reflecting on their ex
perience traveling to Israel
over winter break on a campus
leaders mission sponsored by
The David Project.

In the first two parts of this se
ries, we talked about some issues
concerning Israel that are impor
tant but little discussed. We close
by exploring the issue that, al
though packaged in various ways, is
the most prominent problem con
cerning Israel today: the relation
ship between Israel and its neigh
bors.

Israel commonly receives criti
cism for its fences and closed bor
ders, which are sometimes even
compared to the Berlin Wall. How
ever, to many living in Israel these
barriers and border checkpoints
exist as a necessity for Israeli secu
rity. It is no secret that these check
points are burdensome for Arab Is
raelis and Palestinians who desire
to cross the border, but when con
sidering that there are still planned
terrorist attacks caught at these
checkpoints, it is clear that they do
hold a security purpose.

Critics cite the low number of
terrorist attacks that do take place

as proof of excessive paranoia and
repressiveness in Israeli security
measures, but in reality it actually
speaks volumes to the security sys
tem's effectiveness. Israel devel
oped this tight security system af
ter the Second Intifada, which end
ed in 2006 after thousands of casu
alties. These checkpoints are phys
ical embodiments of Israelis' last
ing fear and paranoia, and they are
the manifestation of the victimiza
tion of the Palestinian people due to
the actions of a few. We encourage
further investigation into the pur
pose and possible solutions to the
checkpoints.

Amjhed, a Jordanian doctor in
the residency program at Hadas
sah hospital in Jerusalem, lives in
the West Bank and travels through
a checkpoint on his way to and from
work every day. According to him,
the process takes about an hour
and a half. He considers it similar to
going through airport security
something that people get used to
and willingly endure for their own
safety.

Amjhed considers it an honor to
work at Hadassah, not only be
cause of its international prestige
but also because of its moral philos
ophy of non-discrimination.
When we walked into Hadassah,
the diversity of people within the

hospital â€”of both patients and
professionals was striking. We
saw an Orthodox Jewish man with
his black hat and pe'ot (sidelocks)
sharing an elevator with a Muslim
woman in hijab. Barbara Sofer,
Hadassah's director of communica
tions, told us this juxtaposition re
flected the essence of Hadassah's
principles. Hadassah refuses to tol
erate discrimination. Jewish and
non-Jewish doctors treat Jewish
and non-Jewish patients alike.

The ultimate test of this ideolo
gy came during the Second Intifa
da, when people affected by the vi
olence were flown in from all over
Israel for treatment at Hadassah.
Doctors opened ambulances to find
their children lying in the gurneys
and nurses combed through wards
for their family members. In Bar
bara's words, at that moment
everyone Jewish, Muslim or
Christian could have exerted the
right to say no, but they understood
that as medical professionals they
served people, not an ideology.

But even Hadassah could not es
cape the hatred present in the re
gion at that time. The synagogue
within the hospital has a collection
of stunning stained glass windows
by Marc Chagall depicting the 12
tribes of Israel. The violence during
the Six Day War destroyed three of

these windows. Chagall reportedly
told the hospital, "You take care of
fixing the people, I'll take care of
fixing the windows." That violence
is not alien to the Israelis and
Palestinians of today.

These places and experiences
merely sample the varied itinerary
of our trip. The people we heard
from came from all sorts of back
grounds in relation to Israel and
gave us an incredibly assorted set
of perspectives to reframe our
thinking about the country. The 33
of us also represented a wide spec
trum of views on Israel based on
our individual backgrounds, some
of us vocally pro-Palestinian and
others veteran Israel advocates.
But after hearing the truths of
these individuals, we as a group
now share a new understanding
that to be pro-Palestinian, you also
have to be pro-Israeli and vice ver
sa. Until mutual respect between
the two communities and their ad
vocates becomes the status quo,
progress towards peace and a last
ing solution will remain in a frus
trating deadlock.

What we bring back from this
trip to Stanford's campus: For
everyone else with an opinion on Is
rael, we challenge you to question
the completeness of the per
spectives that inform your
own viewpoints on Israel.
It's easy to sit in America
and hear all the media buzz
about human rights viola
tions and decide that Israel
is the bad guy. It's also easy
to go on one of the many
Jewish, pro-Israeli trips that
present a manicured view of
the country and form the op
posite viewpoint. Neither of
these situations affords you

enough knowledge to form
an informed opinion.
In order to form a fully
informed opinion, you must
go out of your way to look
beyond what you think you
know. You must practice
compassionate listening for
those with whom you're sure
you will disagree, such as
when David Project took us
to hear from the prominent
Arab-Israeli Forsan Hus
sein.

So the next time you're
sitting in Arrillaga watching
a CNN report on Kerry's ne
gotiations in Israel or walk
ing through White Plaza
past a demonstration accus

ing Israel of being an
apartheid state, make sure
you remember the people
behind the place. Be aware
of your biases and remem
ber that there are limitations
to what you can know. Don't
mistake the clarity of the one
cell you've analyzed through
the lens of your microscope
for the reality that affects
millions of real people living
across the body of Israel and
Palestine.
