# ANDREWS ASSESSMENT
## A 						Tribute to Scott McKeon 
### McKenzie Andrews 
Despite the fact that Stanford
is one of the best universities
in the nation, many of our in
troductory classes are huge and
fairly impersonal. I've been frus
trated by the heavy weight of exams
in class grading. Back in the heyday
that was high school, there were
points for class participation, proj
ects and turning in homework. Here
at college, Stanford's big quantita
tive classes weigh more heavily con
tent and test performance. Talking
to one Economics professor, I got a
bit of faculty insight on the lay of the
Stanford land.

A bit of background: Scott McK
eon is one of the best professors
I've had at Stanford. He writes ex
tensive and comprehensive lecture
notes, stays after class to answer
his students' questions, replies to
emails and generally is engaging

and understandable when teaching
econometrics.

When a friend posted an article
about his time teaching at North
western's Kellogg School of Busi
ness on my Facebook timeline with
the subhead "All Hail Scott McK
eon," more than 20 people liked it.
When Asian tourists pass Econ
1028, they take pictures of Scott
McKeon. He remembers students'
names. In a world where students
are sometimes taught by teachers
who, to put it diplomatically, focus
more on research than teaching,
McKeon is available, funny and in
vested in his students' learning.

I emailed Professor McKeon to
ask how I could improve my per
formance on exams at Stanford.
There was probably some frustra
tion between the lines. I wrote it af
ter disappointing myself on an ex

am, and generally feeling crushed
by the academic excellence that is
seemingly personified by everyone
else at the Farm. Should I apply
for extended, time? I wondered.
Should I transfer to some
where easier? Professor McKeon
responded with these words:

"This school is different. I be
lieve most professors here write ex
ams with the intention of forcing a
fairly low average, so they can get a
curve (although sometimes that's
the very thing that prevents a
curve). Writing a test that averages
above 90 percent causes huge grad
ing problems; grades are then dic
tated by minuscule differences in
student performance. Most profes
sors overcompensate by giving bru
tal exams. There's no way to say
whether that philosophy is right or
wrong but my point is that the issue
here could be the testing philoso
phy as opposed to something with
you personally. I assure you that
Stanford's culture can give you a
very warped view of your place in
the world."

He noted in closing, " ... my
sense is that you are unfortunately
just as normal as the rest of us."

Stanford is hard. It takes re
silience to be here amongst a lot of
intelligent, ambitious people: We
have people doing big things, and
our successes take different forms.
The bubble isn't an easy place to
practice failure when it seems to
contrasts so sharply with the suc
cess we drown in.

Consider Scott's wisdom: "My
recommendation is that you quit
being so hard on yourself," he told
me. "For better or for worse, nasty
exams are the culture of this school
for quantitative courses. When I
was a business school instructor,
class averages were about 85 per
cent. There is simply no question in
my mind that you would have fin
ished those exams very well ahead
of time and you would have simply
crushed the other people in the
room."

"Duck Syndrome" pressure can
cause small or serious problems.
This year, I had a conversation with
someone falling through the cracks
that inspired me to take the class to
work at The Bridge, a student-run
counseling center with a mission to
help and support others through
personal interaction.

In the last few weeks, we cov
ered suicides. According to their
numbers, our university has about
70 suicide attempts a year. From
bad midterms to bad breakups (or
weird hookups that come and go
without ever really being defined),
life isn't perfect, even at Stanford.
The Residential Dean who spoke to
the class said that at any given
time, attempted suicides have usu
ally put about one student in the
hospital.
My Dad once told me, "Suicide

is a permanent solution to a tempo
rary problem." Regardless of what
we're going through, it's important
to remember how valuable every
member of our community is and to
take time out of our busy schedules
to care for those around us. Stan
ford is a humbling place, and it's
OK when we don't always succeed
in ways that we'd like. Coming
from a professor, McKeon's words
are touching as we work to main
tain perspective at college.

McKenzie hopes everyone is taking
care of themselves as the quarter
comes to a close. Contact her at an
drews7@ Stanford, edu.

Stanford is hard. It takes re
silience to be here amongst a lot of
intelligent, ambitious people: We
have people doing big things, and
our successes take different forms.
The bubble isn't an easy place to

Consider Scott's wisdom: "My
recommendation is that you quit
being so hard on yourself," he told
me. "For better or for worse, nasty
exams are the culture of this school
for quantitative courses. When I
was a business school instructor,
class averages were about 85 per
cent. There is simply no question in
my mind that you would have fin
ished those exams very well ahead
of time and you would have simply
crushed the other people in the
room."

This year, I had a conversation with
someone falling through the cracks

In the last few weeks, we cov
ered suicides. According to their
numbers, our university has about
70 suicide attempts a year. From
bad midterms to bad breakups (or
weird hookups that come and go
without ever really being defined),
life isn't perfect, even at Stanford.
The Residential Dean who spoke to
the class said that at any given
time, attempted suicides have usu
ally put about one student in the
hospital.
My Dad once told me, "Suicide

is a permanent solution to a tempo
rary problem." Regardless of what
we're going through, it's important
to remember how valuable every
member of our community is and to
take time out of our busy schedules
to care for those around us. Stan
ford is a humbling place, and it's
OK when we don't always succeed
in ways that we'd like. Coming
from a professor, McKeon's words
are touching as we work to main
tain perspective at college.

care of themselves as the quarter

Despite the fact that Stanford
is one of the best universities
in the nation, many of our in
troductory classes are huge and
fairly impersonal. I've been frus
trated by the heavy weight of exams
in class grading. Back in the heyday
that was high school, there were
points for class participation, proj
ects and turning in homework. Here
at college, Stanford's big quantita
tive classes weigh more heavily con
tent and test performance. Talking
to one Economics professor, I got a
bit of faculty insight on the lay of the
Stanford land.

A bit of background: Scott McK
eon is one of the best professors
I've had at Stanford. He writes ex
tensive and comprehensive lecture
notes, stays after class to answer
his students' questions, replies to
emails and generally is engaging

and understandable when teaching
econometrics.

When a friend posted an article
about his time teaching at North
western's Kellogg School of Busi
ness on my Facebook timeline with
the subhead "All Hail Scott McK
eon," more than 20 people liked it.
When Asian tourists pass Econ
1028, they take pictures of Scott
McKeon. He remembers students'
names. In a world where students
are sometimes taught by teachers
who, to put it diplomatically, focus
more on research than teaching,
McKeon is available, funny and in
vested in his students' learning.

I emailed Professor McKeon to
ask how I could improve my per
formance on exams at Stanford.
There was probably some frustra
tion between the lines. I wrote it af
ter disappointing myself on an ex

am, and generally feeling crushed
by the academic excellence that is
seemingly personified by everyone
else at the Farm. Should I apply
for extended, time? I wondered.
Should I transfer to some
where easier? Professor McKeon
responded with these words:

"This school is different. I be
lieve most professors here write ex
ams with the intention of forcing a
fairly low average, so they can get a
curve (although sometimes that's
the very thing that prevents a
curve). Writing a test that averages
above 90 percent causes huge grad
ing problems; grades are then dic
tated by minuscule differences in
student performance. Most profes
sors overcompensate by giving bru
tal exams. There's no way to say
whether that philosophy is right or
wrong but my point is that the issue
here could be the testing philoso
phy as opposed to something with
you personally. I assure you that
Stanford's culture can give you a
very warped view of your place in
the world."
