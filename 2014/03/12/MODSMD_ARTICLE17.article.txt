# I Am Narcissus, and You Can Be Too
## 
### Vihan Lakshman 
I had a professor freshman year
who believed that, in the not-so
distant future, students and lit
erary scholars alike will study
tweets in the same manner that we
today carefully analyze poetry or
paintings.
As I pictured high school stu
dents trying to scan the meter and
explicate meaning in one of Justin
Bieber's heartwarming, soul-pene
trating pearls of wisdom, such as
"Goodnight ladies #muchlove," the
idea immediately seemed ridicu
lous to me.

But maybe I just wasn't able to
appreciate what my professor was
saying that day because I have a
very detached relationship with
technology. I handwrite all of my
written assignments (including this
article) because I don't like staring
at a computer screen for long peri
ods of time; heck, I even prefer to
write out lines of code on paper be
fore transferring them over (which
I realize makes absolutely no
sense). My younger brother also
loves to make fun of me because I
can see all of the apps on my iPhone
without having to slide my thumb
across the screen.

That's why I probably scoffed at
the idea that our future
Wordsworths will express them
selves in the world of 140 charac
ters. But that was before I actually
tried my hand at the whole social
media thing before I dived into
the world of the little blue bird.

I made my Twitter account in
November of my freshman year
a month after that class discussion
in an attempt to interact with lis
teners during my KZSU Radio vol

leyball and basketball broadcasts.
After a barrage of initial tweets,
however, I neglected my account. I
kept that strange egg photo place
holder instead of posting a real pro
file picture, and my Twitter activity
was reduced to posting the occa
sional "Stanford basketball up by
five at halftime" when I suddenly
remembered that I had a Twitter
during a broadcast.
Up until two months ago, I did
n't really give a second thought to
my Twitter account and I'm sure
my whopping ten followers didn't
either until one day I noticed
that the number had shot up all the
way to eleven, with the additional
subscriber being none other than
star defensive end Ben Gardner.

I had just come out of a midterm
which I was certain I had failed, but
getting the Ben Gardner Twitter
follow instantly made that day one
of the best in my life (#priorities).
Immediately, I became paranoid
about having an account worthy of
@BennyG49 and hungry to attract
more followers. Thus, I made the
conscious effort to tweet regularly.
At first, I only documented a
few important, moments that hap
pened each week. Attended a lec
ture by a former Secretary of De
fense. Tweeted it. Washed my
hands next to Bill Walton in the
Maples Pavilion bathroom. Tweet
ed it.

In two weeks, I couldn't get
enough of Twitter, even after Mr.
Gardner unfollowed me (#pleasec
omeback). Now, I was tweeting
everything that popped into my
mind because I loved the idea of be
ing able to talk about me to the en

tire world (or at least my lean and
mean ten followers). Remembered
that I had a club meeting while
brushing my teeth. Tweeted it.
Craved a large burrito. Tweeted it.
Watched curling on T.V Tweeted it.
Soon, I was devoting a large chunk
of my day to the land of 140 charac
ters, thinking constantly about
what events in my life needed to be
shared with the world and agoniz
ing over every last hashtag.
Today, Twitter and I are enjoy
ing a healthy, moderate relation
ship after I decided that it was too
much work to document every sin
gle detail of my life. I've also re
signed myself to the fact that Ben
Gardner is not coming back

(#please?). Above all, I now believe
my professor was absolutely right:
The tweet will become the literary
art form of the future because I
have seen in my experience and
in the accounts of others that
people are willing to pour their
lives out on social media. Tweets, by
default, will become the way of the
future, because who has time to
write books and poems when there
are so many moments to document
and favorite?
Do Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat
and many similar platforms pro
mote narcissism? Absolutely, but
that is not such a bad thing. Sure,
they can cause unhealthy obses
sions and limit "meaningful" pro

ductivity, but they allow people to
share their lives, talk about them
selves to a wide audience and
maybe even become the revered
poets of future generations. I, for
one, am proud to send off Bieber as
the poetic ambassador for our gen
eration.

Sure, Narcissus withered away
from not being able to take his eyes
off of his own reflection, but during
that short period of time when he
was alive and deeply, madly in love
with himself, he must have felt
pretty damn happy.
