# Bridging the Civil-Military Divide at Stanford
## 
### Kimberly Tan 
Last quarter, I was casually
chatting with a freshman stu
dent when he remarked:

"Wait, you know I'm 24, right?"
I didn't. But apparently, while I
had been studying math and Eng
lish in Silicon Valley, he had been in
the Israeli Defense Force, where he
studied for the SAT in a bomb shel
ter and only decided to apply to col
lege after his military service.
At Stanford, his story is perhaps
uncommon, but certainly not
unique. Yet for me, coming from a
community where hardly anyone
considers military service, speak
ing or thinking about the military
was something I rarely, if ever, did.
Though he served a different na
tion, his experiences nevertheless
alerted me to my own ignorance
about the U.S. military.
I'm not alone. Though polls indi
cate that the military has the high
est approval rating of any federal
institution in the United States, the
growing civil-military divide (in
short, the lack of public awareness
about the military) has led to a
weakening of ties between the civil
ian-controlled military and the
civilians themselves. This phenom
enon is partially due to the end of
the draft in 1973, which eased citi
zens' worries about being called to
serve, allowed them to become less
engaged with military affairs and
led to an overall decrease in the
military's citizen oversight.
The effects of this divide are

dangerous. According to Kristina
Lobo, director of the Haas Center
Military Service as Public Service
(MSAPS) program, the public
needs to be informed about mili
tary affairs "so we can voice our
opinions to our elected officials."
She explains that "our military was
designed to operate under civilian
control, so failing to form and voice
opinions on military affairs is ne
glecting our responsibility as citi
zens." In doing so, we allow an in
credibly powerful force to under
take risky operations without being
scrutinized, making the military al
most too easy for the government
to use.

If we aren't informed, the mili
tary becomes a hammer for the
government to use, and every issue
looks like a nail.

I attended an event by MSAPS
a few weeks ago, where four former
military officers who are current
Stanford graduate students dis
cussed their experiences both in
combat and after their return. One
officer recounted how, when stand
ing in line at Subway with one of his
friends who had lost a leg in com
bat, a lady standing next to them
pointed to his friend's leg and
asked about what had happened.
"I lost it at Fallujah," he said, re
ferring to the Battle of Fallujah in
the Iraq War.
Her response: "What's a fallu
jah?"

Her reply exemplifies the irony

of people's perception of the mili
tary— though it is the institution
supported by the public the most, it
is the one understood the least.
This became even more evident
when the panelists unanimously
agreed that it was difficult to re
turn to the U.S. after witnessing
torture, human shields and the vic
timization of women and children,
only to realize that civilians have
no idea what is happening.
"People like to thank us for our
service when they don't really
know what we did," one panelist
said. And it's true —we love to
thank troops for their service, hoist
American flags and admire soldiers
for defending our nation. But do we
know what these soldiers did and
what they fought for?
What are we really thanking
them for?

The fact is, when you think
about our citizenry today, most peo
ple have no idea what their soldiers
are doing. But to sustain civilian
control over military operations
and hold our government account
able for its policies abroad, it is crit
ical for us to be aware about what
the military is doing, regardless of
our personal opinions about the
military itself. People can die in
combat. And though our lives may
not be at stake, others' lives are,
and our personal distance from
these issues doesn't justify our ig-
norance for what happens at
the front lines.
At Stanford, with the
whirlwind of classes and in
ternships and relationships
and parties, it is undeniably
difficult to stay informed.
But students should never
theless strive to do so by
reading the news and get
ting to know a veteran
whether by interacting with
one in class, attending

events hosted by MSAPS or
the Haas Center or reaching
out to Stanford faculty or
Hoover fellows with military
backgrounds.
Part of being at Stanford
is engaging with the diversi
ty we pride ourselves so
highly for, and this diversity
stems not just from ethnic
or socio-economic differ
ences, but also from the dif
ferences of our experiences.
Listening to others' stories
is simply part of our overall
Stanford experience an
other way to broaden our
perspective by learning
from not just our instruc

tors, but from each other as
well.

"It's different t0... [hear]
from someone who was on
the ground," one panelist
concluded. "We really enjoy
the opportunity to share our
experiences."

Last quarter, I was casually
chatting with a freshman stu
dent when he remarked:

"Wait, you know I'm 24, right?"
I didn't. But apparently, while I
had been studying math and Eng
lish in Silicon Valley, he had been in
the Israeli Defense Force, where he
studied for the SAT in a bomb shel
ter and only decided to apply to col
lege after his military service.
At Stanford, his story is perhaps
uncommon, but certainly not
unique. Yet for me, coming from a
community where hardly anyone
considers military service, speak
ing or thinking about the military
was something I rarely, if ever, did.
Though he served a different na
tion, his experiences nevertheless
alerted me to my own ignorance
about the U.S. military.
I'm not alone. Though polls indi
cate that the military has the high
est approval rating of any federal
institution in the United States, the
growing civil-military divide (in
short, the lack of public awareness
about the military) has led to a
weakening of ties between the civil
ian-controlled military and the
civilians themselves. This phenom
enon is partially due to the end of
the draft in 1973, which eased citi
zens' worries about being called to
serve, allowed them to become less
engaged with military affairs and
led to an overall decrease in the
military's citizen oversight.
The effects of this divide are

dangerous. According to Kristina
Lobo, director of the Haas Center
Military Service as Public Service
(MSAPS) program, the public
needs to be informed about mili
tary affairs "so we can voice our
opinions to our elected officials."
She explains that "our military was
designed to operate under civilian
control, so failing to form and voice
opinions on military affairs is ne
glecting our responsibility as citi
zens." In doing so, we allow an in
credibly powerful force to under
take risky operations without being
scrutinized, making the military al
most too easy for the government
to use.

If we aren't informed, the mili
tary becomes a hammer for the
government to use, and every issue
looks like a nail.

I attended an event by MSAPS
a few weeks ago, where four former
military officers who are current
Stanford graduate students dis
cussed their experiences both in
combat and after their return. One
officer recounted how, when stand
ing in line at Subway with one of his
friends who had lost a leg in com
bat, a lady standing next to them
pointed to his friend's leg and
asked about what had happened.
"I lost it at Fallujah," he said, re
ferring to the Battle of Fallujah in
the Iraq War.
Her response: "What's a fallu
jah?"

Her reply exemplifies the irony

of people's perception of the mili
tary— though it is the institution
supported by the public the most, it
is the one understood the least.
This became even more evident
when the panelists unanimously
agreed that it was difficult to re
turn to the U.S. after witnessing
torture, human shields and the vic
timization of women and children,
only to realize that civilians have
no idea what is happening.
"People like to thank us for our
service when they don't really
know what we did," one panelist
said. And it's true —we love to
thank troops for their service, hoist
American flags and admire soldiers
for defending our nation. But do we
know what these soldiers did and
what they fought for?
What are we really thanking
them for?

The fact is, when you think
about our citizenry today, most peo
ple have no idea what their soldiers
are doing. But to sustain civilian
control over military operations
and hold our government account
able for its policies abroad, it is crit
ical for us to be aware about what
the military is doing, regardless of
our personal opinions about the
military itself. People can die in
combat. And though our lives may
not be at stake, others' lives are,
and our personal distance from
these issues doesn't justify our ig-
norance for what happens at
the front lines.
At Stanford, with the
whirlwind of classes and in
ternships and relationships
and parties, it is undeniably
difficult to stay informed.
But students should never
theless strive to do so by
reading the news and get
ting to know a veteran
whether by interacting with
one in class, attending

events hosted by MSAPS or
the Haas Center or reaching
out to Stanford faculty or
Hoover fellows with military
backgrounds.
