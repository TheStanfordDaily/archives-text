## Dead Houses serve as grad communities Off-campus housing provides graduate students with co-op experience 
### ILEANA NAJARRO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At first, Daniel Greene, a fourth year Ph.D.
student, couldn't believe what his friend told him
about baking bread each night and having im
promptu dance parties in the kitchen at Synergy,
one of the seven Stanford cooperative living com
munities. When Greene visited the Farm for a con
ference and stayed in Synergy, he was blown away
by the friendly community he experienced in such
a short time.

Once he knew he would be going to Stanford
for graduate school, he was set to go back to the
environment the on-campus co-ops offered that
is, until he learned they were housing options for
only undergraduates.
Like other graduate students hoping to take
part in such a community while attending Stan
ford, Greene managed to make his way into Itha
ka, an independent off-campus co-op housed in two
of the nine so-called "Dead Houses" along Embar
cadero Road in Palo Alto.
Dead Houses full of life
The story of Ithaka and how students like
Greene were able to live there starts with long
time Palo Alto resident and Grateful Dead fan,
Rob Levitsky.
For 20 years, Levitsky worked in the chip-test
ing industry in Silicon Valley. For each of the last
15 of those years he bought a new home to rent
out. By 2000, he said he owned 15 total houses in
San Francisco and Palo Alto, all named after
Grateful Dead songs.
"Every house needed a name anyway," Levit
sky said.
Though over the years he sold some and
bought others, Levitsky now owns nine such Dead
Houses in Palo Alto (Box of Rain, Dark Hollow,
Touch of Grey, Uncle John's Band, China Cat, Sun
flower, Bear's Choice, Cassidy and St. Stephen)
and four in San Francisco (Sugar Magnolia, Scar
let Begonias, Franklin's Tower and Ripple).
According to Levitsky, 95 percent of the ten
ants in the Palo Alto Dead Houses are Stanford-af
filiates either undergraduates or graduate stu
dents â€” with a majority having lived in on-cam
pus co-ops or heard about the houses from the
Stanford co-op community.
At about $9OO a month for single rooms and
$6OO for shared rooms, Levitsky offers compara
tively cheap Palo Alto housing for students that
draws high demand year-round, especially in the
summer.

At the off-campus Dead Houses, students are
encouraged to customize their rooms and build
their communities. The houses provide a cheap
alternative to local living options in Palo Alto.
