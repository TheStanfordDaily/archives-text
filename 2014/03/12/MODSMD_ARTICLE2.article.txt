## Dead Houses serve as grad communities Off-campus housing provides graduate students with co-op experience 
### ILEANA NAJARRO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At first, Daniel Greene, a fourth year Ph.D.
student, couldn't believe what his friend told him
about baking bread each night and having im
promptu dance parties in the kitchen at Synergy,
one of the seven Stanford cooperative living com
munities. When Greene visited the Farm for a con
ference and stayed in Synergy, he was blown away
by the friendly community he experienced in such
a short time.

Once he knew he would be going to Stanford
for graduate school, he was set to go back to the
environment the on-campus co-ops offered that
is, until he learned they were housing options for
only undergraduates.
Like other graduate students hoping to take
part in such a community while attending Stan
ford, Greene managed to make his way into Itha
ka, an independent off-campus co-op housed in two
of the nine so-called "Dead Houses" along Embar
cadero Road in Palo Alto.
Dead Houses full of life
The story of Ithaka and how students like
Greene were able to live there starts with long
time Palo Alto resident and Grateful Dead fan,
Rob Levitsky.
For 20 years, Levitsky worked in the chip-test
ing industry in Silicon Valley. For each of the last
15 of those years he bought a new home to rent
out. By 2000, he said he owned 15 total houses in
San Francisco and Palo Alto, all named after
Grateful Dead songs.
"Every house needed a name anyway," Levit
sky said.
Though over the years he sold some and
bought others, Levitsky now owns nine such Dead
Houses in Palo Alto (Box of Rain, Dark Hollow,
Touch of Grey, Uncle John's Band, China Cat, Sun
flower, Bear's Choice, Cassidy and St. Stephen)
and four in San Francisco (Sugar Magnolia, Scar
let Begonias, Franklin's Tower and Ripple).
According to Levitsky, 95 percent of the ten
ants in the Palo Alto Dead Houses are Stanford-af
filiates either undergraduates or graduate stu
dents â€” with a majority having lived in on-cam
pus co-ops or heard about the houses from the
Stanford co-op community.
At about $9OO a month for single rooms and
$6OO for shared rooms, Levitsky offers compara
tively cheap Palo Alto housing for students that
draws high demand year-round, especially in the
summer.

At the off-campus Dead Houses, students are
encouraged to customize their rooms and build
their communities. The houses provide a cheap
alternative to local living options in Palo Alto.
However, long-time Dead
House resident Bobby Hol
ley 'lO M.A. 'll said that
those looking to only find a
cheap housing option forget
the real value: a community
of activity and individuals
open to independence and
new lifestyles.
Except for Box of Rain,
located a few blocks away,
and Touch of Grey, which is
across the street, the Palo Al
to Dead Houses are all next
door to each other, creating
what Holley described as a
village of houses with inter
connected yards and outdoor
eating areas.

Towards the center of this
village, one can find a basket
ball court, a shack housing a
music studio complete with
instruments from around the
world, a woodshop and hand
made bike racks holding up
tenants' rides. There are also
small-scale gardens in each
overgrown yard and Levit
sky's cat, Wilson, roaming
around as he pleases.
According to Levitsky,
much of the rationale for
buying certain homes was
due to how close they stood
to each other. He said this al
lows for a sense of communi
ty among tenants who can
easily join their neighbors
for a meal or a chat outside
each day.
By around 2010, commu
nity was further instilled into
houses Uncle John's Band
and St. Stephen when ten
ants approached Levitsky
with the idea for Ithaka, a
tenant-run co-op comprised
of the two houses, which have
around 25 members in total.
Show a little Ithaka love
Holley, who lived in En
chanted Broccoli Forest
(EBF) during his last under
graduate years at Stanford,
knew he wanted to continue
living in a co-op when he pur
sued his master's degree.
Thus he became of one of
the first-year members of
Ithaka. Currently he's a
part-time member of Ithaka
with another home in Berke
ley.
Holley said that the same
things that initially drew him

to Ithaka have also kept him
from fully leaving: the sense
of ownership the two houses
offer their residents, as well
as Ithaka's "bias toward ac
tion" heuristic through which
residents are encouraged to
follow through with any idea
they have so long as it does
n't upset fellow housemates.
For instance, everyone is
free to paint their own rooms
or build shelves if they are so
inclined, without asking for
permission through struc
tured system.

Much like Stanford co
ops, responsibilities such as
cleaning, cooking and order
ing produce are divvied up

among residents. Although
there is no paid staff coordi
nating the house operations,
residents run weekly house

meetings.
"You're not quite in the
real world, but you're in a
place where people aren't go
ing to do things for you,"
Holley said. "It's up to people
to make their own mark."

For Greene, who first lived in
Box of Rain and for the last
three years has lived in Un
cle John's Band, Ithaka of
fers not just a residence but
also a home where it is easy
to find people to interact
with.

"It's a refreshing per

spective, especially com
pared to grad student life
and on-campus housing
where you come home and
the only person you see is
one or two grad student
roommates, and it's always in
the Stanford bubble,"
Greene said. "This feels very
outside the Stanford bubble
and it's very relaxing."
Whitney Wells 'l2 M.A.
'l4, who lived in Columbae
and Synergy during her un
dergraduate years and now
lives in Uncle John's Band,
also enjoys the ability to live
in a community with a mix of
backgrounds, since not all
residents are necessarily

Stanford-affiliated.
She added that while the
cost-effectiveness of Ithaka
and the Dead Houses in gen
eral is a benefit, it's the
friendly community that
makes it all stand apart from
any regular off-campus resi
dence.

"I'm paying for my little
room, but I'm also paying for
the communal space," Wells
said.

Greene recalled last fall's
"work weekend," when all
the residents got together to
clean up the houses. During
this particular weekend, a
group of returning members
decided to throw an initiation

ceremony for the incoming
Ithaka members where new
members had to clean up the
kitchen in less than half an
hour.

Naturally, the whole thing
transformed into a dance
party.

"It's something that can
only happen when you have a
sense of community," Greene
said. "It's hard for me to
imagine not living in coopera
tive housing now that I've
seen the fun and the support
that can come from sharing a
house with friends."

Rob Levitsky owns several homes that have served as communities for Stanford students who want to reside off-campus but experience the co-op life.
He has purchased nine houses in Palo Alto and four houses in San Francisco, and has named each one after a different Grateful Dead song.
