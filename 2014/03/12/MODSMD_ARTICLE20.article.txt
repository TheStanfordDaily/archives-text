## ALL-IN AT Pac-12s CARD FACE WAZZU IN OPENER 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
With the win on Saturday
against Utah, the Stanford men's
basketball team avoided ending the
regular season on a sour note and,
in the process, prevented further
doubt from creeping into its NCAA
tournament profile. The Cardinal
(19-11, 10-8 Pac-12) escaped the
Utes (20-10,9-9) with a 61-60 victo
ry on a late free throw by senior
Dwight Powell, thus ensuring that
the Cardinal would register their
second winning conference season
of the Johnny Dawkins era, and as
a result, finish in a five-way tie for
third place in the Pac-12.

The Cardinal enter the Pac-12
tournament this week in Las Vegas
as the sixth seed due to the Pac
e's multi-team tiebreak rules.
Tied with Arizona State, Cal, Col
orado and Oregon at 10-8, the Car
dinal were placed sixth thanks to
their performances against the
other four teams.

ASU's 5-3 record against the
cluster of 10-8 schools meant that it
would grab the third seed in the
conference behind first-place Ari
zona and second-place UCLA. Cal
was next, sporting a 3-1 record
against the likes of Colorado, Ore
gon and Stanford. Colorado was
seeded fifth due to its season sweep
of the Ducks and the Cardinal,
while Stanford was placed sixth
and Oregon seventh because of
Stanford's 82-80 win over the
Ducks on Jan. 12.
The rest of the seeds for the
conference tournament include
Utah being seeded eighth, Wash
ington ninth, Oregon State 10th,
Washington State 11th and USC
12th.

The tournament will commence
on Wednesday, when the bottom
eight teams open tournament play.
As the top four seeds, Arizona,
UCLA, ASU and Cal were given
byes into the quarterfinals of the
tournament.

As the sixth seed, Stanford will
begin its quest for the Pac-12 tour-

GAME NOTES: After a nail-biter against
Utah in which the Cardinal ultimately
prevailed, Stanford presumably
clinched a berth in the NCAA Tourna
ment. However, the Cardinal will first
need to weave its way through a
tough Pac-12 Tournament as the No.
6 seed, starting with a matchup on
Wednesday night against 1 lth-seeded
Washington State, a team that the
Cardinal have defeated twice by an
average margin of 22.5 points in the
teams' two meetings this season.

nament title during the final game
scheduled on Wednesday, an 8:30
p.m. tipoff against 11th seed Wash
ington State (10-20,3-15).

Given that it received the sixth
seed in the tournament, Coach
Dawkins' team probably could not
have been more pleased with the
draw.

The Cardinal will open up play
against a WSU team that they have
already defeated twice this season
by an average of 22.5 points per
game. Although the Cougars
proved they are not to be taken
lightly with an emphatic 73-55 rout
of UCLA on Saturday, they have
struggled for the majority of the
conference season, and do not
seem to match up well with Stan
ford. The Cardinal defeated WSU
