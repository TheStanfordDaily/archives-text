## ALL-IN AT Pac-12s CARD FACE WAZZU IN OPENER 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
With the win on Saturday
against Utah, the Stanford men's
basketball team avoided ending the
regular season on a sour note and,
in the process, prevented further
doubt from creeping into its NCAA
tournament profile. The Cardinal
(19-11, 10-8 Pac-12) escaped the
Utes (20-10,9-9) with a 61-60 victo
ry on a late free throw by senior
Dwight Powell, thus ensuring that
the Cardinal would register their
second winning conference season
of the Johnny Dawkins era, and as
a result, finish in a five-way tie for
third place in the Pac-12.

The Cardinal enter the Pac-12
tournament this week in Las Vegas
as the sixth seed due to the Pac
e's multi-team tiebreak rules.
Tied with Arizona State, Cal, Col
orado and Oregon at 10-8, the Car
dinal were placed sixth thanks to
their performances against the
other four teams.

ASU's 5-3 record against the
cluster of 10-8 schools meant that it
would grab the third seed in the
conference behind first-place Ari
zona and second-place UCLA. Cal
was next, sporting a 3-1 record
against the likes of Colorado, Ore
gon and Stanford. Colorado was
seeded fifth due to its season sweep
of the Ducks and the Cardinal,
while Stanford was placed sixth
and Oregon seventh because of
Stanford's 82-80 win over the
Ducks on Jan. 12.
The rest of the seeds for the
conference tournament include
Utah being seeded eighth, Wash
ington ninth, Oregon State 10th,
Washington State 11th and USC
12th.

The tournament will commence
on Wednesday, when the bottom
eight teams open tournament play.
As the top four seeds, Arizona,
UCLA, ASU and Cal were given
byes into the quarterfinals of the
tournament.

As the sixth seed, Stanford will
begin its quest for the Pac-12 tour-

GAME NOTES: After a nail-biter against
Utah in which the Cardinal ultimately
prevailed, Stanford presumably
clinched a berth in the NCAA Tourna
ment. However, the Cardinal will first
need to weave its way through a
tough Pac-12 Tournament as the No.
6 seed, starting with a matchup on
Wednesday night against 1 lth-seeded
Washington State, a team that the
Cardinal have defeated twice by an
average margin of 22.5 points in the
teams' two meetings this season.

nament title during the final game
scheduled on Wednesday, an 8:30
p.m. tipoff against 11th seed Wash
ington State (10-20,3-15).

Given that it received the sixth
seed in the tournament, Coach
Dawkins' team probably could not
have been more pleased with the
draw.

The Cardinal will open up play
against a WSU team that they have
already defeated twice this season
by an average of 22.5 points per
game. Although the Cougars
proved they are not to be taken
lightly with an emphatic 73-55 rout
of UCLA on Saturday, they have
struggled for the majority of the
conference season, and do not
seem to match up well with Stan
ford. The Cardinal defeated WSU

Senior center Stefan Nastic (above) shot 6-for-6 from the field,
scoring 14 points on Senior Day against Utah. He will look to
maintain his efficiency in the Pac- 12 Tournament opener.

80-48 at Maples Pavilion on Jan. 15
before taking care of business once
more a month later during a 69-56
triumph in Pullman, Wash.
The Cougars failed to score con
sistently in both games against
Stanford this season, a strong re
flection of the struggling offense
the team has put on the floor all
season long. WSU averages just
62.4 points per game, a number
that has dropped to 56.8 points per
game during its conference slate.
Even if the Cardinal fail to defend
particularly well against Washing
ton State, it seems unlikely that the
Cougars have the offensive
weapons to compete with Stan
ford's potent starting lineup.
That's not to say that WSU is
devoid of any scoring threats on its

roster. To the contrary, head coach
Ken Bone and company are led by
one of the best in the conference in
junior guard DaVonte Lacy. Lacy's
19.1 points-per-game scoring aver
age is the second-best in the con
ference, and he has a propensity for
scoring outbursts that have at
times given superior teams plenty
to be nervous about. His 39-point
effort against Cal on Feb. 12 helped
the Cougars push the Bears to
overtime, while a 34-point perform
ance against Colorado on Feb. 5
had the Cougars within three
points of the Buffaloes with fewer
than 10 seconds to play.
Washington State's problem is
that none of its next five leading
scorers average double figures or
shoot greater than 40 percent from
the field. The Cougars have been
simply unable to find secondary
scorers during the course of the
season. Expect that trend to con
tinue on Wednesday, when the
Cougars are confronted by a pair of

the best individual defenders in the
conference in Stanford's Josh
Huestis and Anthony Brown.
Assuming the Cardinal can get
past the Cougars, they would
match up with Arizona State in the
quarterfinals of the Pac-12 tourna
ment during the 8:30 p.m. time slot
on Thursday. Stanford prevailed
against ASU 76-70 at Maples on
Feb. 1 before dooming itself with a
poor start in a 76-64 defeat in
Tempe, Ariz., on Feb. 26.
The single largest difference
between Stanford's performances
against Arizona State on Feb. 1
and Feb. 26 was Stanford's offen
sive execution, particularly in the
turnover department. The Cardi
nal turned the ball over six more
times in the loss to ASU than they
did in the win, and the difference of
effectiveness between the two
games can easily be seen in the
varied success of Powell, a player
who relies on others to get him the
ball during the flow of the offense.

In Stanford's win, Powell was
the most dominant player on the
court, scoring 28 points and hand
ing out five assists while leading a
second-half charge that extended
the Cardinal's lead far enough to
help stave off the Sun Devils in the
end. In the loss, Powell looked out
of sorts, scoring just 11 points on 2-
of-9 shooting. If Stanford is going
to make a run during the postsea
son, it is imperative that it gets its
primary low post scoring threat in
volved, and that it does not waste
possessions like it did during a 10-
turnover performance during the
first half at Arizona State.

Aside from taking care of the
ball, Stanford can make its life
easier by crashing the boards. Ari
zona State is the worst rebounding
team in the conference, yet it
handily outrebounded the Cardi
nal in Tempe. Dawkins' crew
would be wise not only to prevent
that from happening again, but to
take advantage of the Sun Devils'

greatest weakness.
Lastly, if the Cardinal didn't
know it by now, they should keep
in mind that Tree-killing lumber
jack Jahii Carson must be
stopped. ASU's sophomore guard
is averaging 24.8 points per game
in four career contests against the
Cardinal, and was personally re
sponsible for ousting Stanford
from last year's Pac-12 tourna
ment. Just slowing him down
might be enough to help Stanford
reach the semifinals.

Should Stanford get that far, a
relatively favorable matchup
would probably await in the form
of second-seed UCLA or seventh
seeded Oregon. The Cardinal has
a combined 2-1 record against
those two schools this season.

Pac-12 Tournament play for the
Cardinal begins Wednesday in Las
Vegas at noon.
