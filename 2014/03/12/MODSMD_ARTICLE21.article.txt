# Bigger role for tight ends
## 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
For a college football team tied with UCLA
and Wisconsin for the most tight ends current
ly on NFL rosters with four, Stanford football
utilized its historically talented position very lit
tle last season. Stanford's tight ends made just
10 catches for 69 yards in 2013, and multiple
tight end sets appeared on the field much less
often than in previous years when Zach Ertz
'l3, Coby Fleener 'l2 and Levine Toilolo 'l3
manned the position.
In 2014, expect that to change.

After redshirting their first year on the
farm, freshmen Austin Hooper, Greg Taboada
and Eric Cotton join a group with junior Char
lie Hopkins, senior Eddie Plantaric and sopho
more Alex Frkovic, among others, that hopes to
earn playing time and replicate the production
of some of its Stanford tight end predecessors.

"We obviously lost a lot of guys the year be
fore with Zaeh and Levine," Hooper said. "All
the freshmen were just trying to learn the of
fense. When you have as many talented re
ceivers as we had, it was tough to say that we
needed three-tight end sets... Now, with this
position group, we have more experience over
all so hopefully we can see more tight ends in
the game this season."

Stanford's classic three-tight end set was not
used often last season, in favor of the jumbo for
mation when offensive linemen, like sopho
mores Josh Garnett and Kyle Murphy, lined up
as tight ends. While bringing extra offensive
linemen on the field has been a favored maneu
ver of the Cardinal, tight ends rarely saw the
field in that formation or in any other forma
tion, with linemen assuming the jumbo tight
end roles and wide receivers serving as the

foundation of the passing game. However, the
addition of the three talented tight ends coming
off of their redshirt seasons may signal a return
to frequent action for the position.
"You see that advantage that we had before
with all those guys that were here you see
that advantage coming back," said head coach
David Shaw. "We're not just going to put three
guys out there if they can't do what we need
them to do. We have guys that can beat man
coverage. Those three athletic tight ends can
actually beat man coverage and we're excited
about that."

Athleticism has clearly returned to the posi
tion with the 6-foot-6,242-pound Cotton, 6-foot
5, 231-pound Taboada and 6-foot-4, 254-pound
Hooper looking to assume major roles. Yet, the
three young tight ends have impressed on the
field this spring not only with their physical

FOOTBALL NOTES
prowess, but also with their mental
development.
"As a whole, we're doing a real
ly good job learning the plays,"
Taboada said. "It's getting more
gradual and we're not going in the
huddle freaking out as much so we
can actually just play and not be
thinking all the time."
The tight ends may be the last
piece of what could be a dominant
aerial attack this season for the
Cardinal. Shaw raved about the
depth of the wide receivers at
many of this spring's practices. A
tight end that can boost the inter
mediate passing game, or even sev
eral tight ends that can contribute
in this regard, would give the Car
dinal an unprecedented wealth in
the passing game. Although play
ing time is up for grabs, the tight
ends know that snaps will not be
given to them simply because of
the void at the position.
"We're just getting opportuni
ties," Hooper said. "If we execute,
we get to run it again. If not, we got

to keep it rolling. It's just under
standing the plays and executing to
perfection."
"You just realize you're not the
scout team anymore," added
Taboada on his increased practice
reps at tight end. "You're not just
hitting dummies. You're trying to
prove that you can do some stuff
and that you can play on Satur
days."

Once summer practices begin,
four-star recruit and incoming
freshman Dalton Schultz the na
tion's top high school tight end
will arrive and reinforce the posi
tion as well. Even though most
Stanford freshmen tend to take a
year to add strength and learn the
playbook before stepping on the
field, Schultz figures to at least
challenge for snaps at tight end
this summer.

"I'm excited for him to get
here," Shaw said. "He loves foot
ball, he loves it here and he's excit
ed about being here. We'll see if he
plays into a role early or if, like
most guys, he takes a year to get
strong and get ready for college
football."

tion, with linemen assuming the jumbo tight
end roles and wide receivers serving as the

foundation of the passing game. However, the
addition of the three talented tight ends coming
off of their redshirt seasons may signal a return
to frequent action for the position.
"You see that advantage that we had before
with all those guys that were here you see
that advantage coming back," said head coach
David Shaw. "We're not just going to put three
guys out there if they can't do what we need
them to do. We have guys that can beat man
coverage. Those three athletic tight ends can
actually beat man coverage and we're excited
about that."

Athleticism has clearly returned to the posi
tion with the 6-foot-6,242-pound Cotton, 6-foot
5, 231-pound Taboada and 6-foot-4, 254-pound
Hooper looking to assume major roles. Yet, the
three young tight ends have impressed on the
field this spring not only with their physical

FOOTBALL NOTES
prowess, but also with their mental
development.
"As a whole, we're doing a real
ly good job learning the plays,"
Taboada said. "It's getting more
gradual and we're not going in the
huddle freaking out as much so we
can actually just play and not be
thinking all the time."
The tight ends may be the last
piece of what could be a dominant
aerial attack this season for the
Cardinal. Shaw raved about the
depth of the wide receivers at
many of this spring's practices. A
tight end that can boost the inter
mediate passing game, or even sev
eral tight ends that can contribute
in this regard, would give the Car
dinal an unprecedented wealth in
the passing game. Although play
ing time is up for grabs, the tight
ends know that snaps will not be
given to them simply because of
the void at the position.
"We're just getting opportuni
ties," Hooper said. "If we execute,
we get to run it again. If not, we got

to keep it rolling. It's just under
standing the plays and executing to
perfection."
"You just realize you're not the
scout team anymore," added
Taboada on his increased practice
reps at tight end. "You're not just
hitting dummies. You're trying to
prove that you can do some stuff
and that you can play on Satur
days."

Once summer practices begin,
four-star recruit and incoming
freshman Dalton Schultz the na
tion's top high school tight end
will arrive and reinforce the posi
tion as well. Even though most
Stanford freshmen tend to take a
year to add strength and learn the
playbook before stepping on the
field, Schultz figures to at least
challenge for snaps at tight end
this summer.

"I'm excited for him to get
here," Shaw said. "He loves foot
ball, he loves it here and he's excit
ed about being here. We'll see if he
plays into a role early or if, like
most guys, he takes a year to get
strong and get ready for college
football."

Freshman tight end Austin Hooper (front), a San Ramon, Calif., native,
will compete for a starting job after redshirting his first season on the
Farm. Stanford aims to utiltize its tight ends more often this season.
For a college football team tied with UCLA
and Wisconsin for the most tight ends current
ly on NFL rosters with four, Stanford football
utilized its historically talented position very lit
tle last season. Stanford's tight ends made just
10 catches for 69 yards in 2013, and multiple
tight end sets appeared on the field much less
often than in previous years when Zach Ertz
'l3, Coby Fleener 'l2 and Levine Toilolo 'l3
manned the position.
In 2014, expect that to change.

After redshirting their first year on the
farm, freshmen Austin Hooper, Greg Taboada
and Eric Cotton join a group with junior Char
lie Hopkins, senior Eddie Plantaric and sopho
more Alex Frkovic, among others, that hopes to
earn playing time and replicate the production
of some of its Stanford tight end predecessors.

"We obviously lost a lot of guys the year be
fore with Zaeh and Levine," Hooper said. "All
the freshmen were just trying to learn the of
fense. When you have as many talented re
ceivers as we had, it was tough to say that we
needed three-tight end sets... Now, with this
position group, we have more experience over
all so hopefully we can see more tight ends in
the game this season."

Stanford's classic three-tight end set was not
used often last season, in favor of the jumbo for
mation when offensive linemen, like sopho
mores Josh Garnett and Kyle Murphy, lined up
as tight ends. While bringing extra offensive
linemen on the field has been a favored maneu
ver of the Cardinal, tight ends rarely saw the
field in that formation or in any other forma
tion, with linemen assuming the jumbo tight
end roles and wide receivers serving as the

foundation of the passing game. However, the
addition of the three talented tight ends coming
off of their redshirt seasons may signal a return
