# Bigger role for tight ends
## 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
For a college football team tied with UCLA
and Wisconsin for the most tight ends current
ly on NFL rosters with four, Stanford football
utilized its historically talented position very lit
tle last season. Stanford's tight ends made just
10 catches for 69 yards in 2013, and multiple
tight end sets appeared on the field much less
often than in previous years when Zach Ertz
'l3, Coby Fleener 'l2 and Levine Toilolo 'l3
manned the position.
In 2014, expect that to change.

After redshirting their first year on the
farm, freshmen Austin Hooper, Greg Taboada
and Eric Cotton join a group with junior Char
lie Hopkins, senior Eddie Plantaric and sopho
more Alex Frkovic, among others, that hopes to
earn playing time and replicate the production
of some of its Stanford tight end predecessors.

"We obviously lost a lot of guys the year be
fore with Zaeh and Levine," Hooper said. "All
the freshmen were just trying to learn the of
fense. When you have as many talented re
ceivers as we had, it was tough to say that we
needed three-tight end sets... Now, with this
position group, we have more experience over
all so hopefully we can see more tight ends in
the game this season."

Stanford's classic three-tight end set was not
used often last season, in favor of the jumbo for
mation when offensive linemen, like sopho
mores Josh Garnett and Kyle Murphy, lined up
as tight ends. While bringing extra offensive
linemen on the field has been a favored maneu
ver of the Cardinal, tight ends rarely saw the
field in that formation or in any other forma
tion, with linemen assuming the jumbo tight
end roles and wide receivers serving as the

foundation of the passing game. However, the
addition of the three talented tight ends coming
off of their redshirt seasons may signal a return
to frequent action for the position.
"You see that advantage that we had before
with all those guys that were here you see
that advantage coming back," said head coach
David Shaw. "We're not just going to put three
guys out there if they can't do what we need
them to do. We have guys that can beat man
coverage. Those three athletic tight ends can
actually beat man coverage and we're excited
about that."

Athleticism has clearly returned to the posi
tion with the 6-foot-6,242-pound Cotton, 6-foot
5, 231-pound Taboada and 6-foot-4, 254-pound
Hooper looking to assume major roles. Yet, the
three young tight ends have impressed on the
field this spring not only with their physical
