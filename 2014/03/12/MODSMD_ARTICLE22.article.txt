Whether they like it
or not, athletes are
entertainers â€” not
too different from A
musicians or ac- pj
tors. While many onlookers like to "w
think that the sports world stands
alone, its players are ultimately en
veloped by the cavernous umbrella of
the entertainment industry. Rabid
fans, inquiring media and the relative
fame that can be gained simply by be
ing an athlete starkly demonstrate this
reality.
