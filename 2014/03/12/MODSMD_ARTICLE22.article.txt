# WILSON'S WAGER
## SENIOR BANKS ON PRECISE PREPARATION DOWN THE STRETCH 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
Whether they like it
or not, athletes are
entertainers — not
too different from A
musicians or ac- pj
tors. While many onlookers like to "w
think that the sports world stands
alone, its players are ultimately en
veloped by the cavernous umbrella of
the entertainment industry. Rabid
fans, inquiring media and the relative
fame that can be gained simply by be
ing an athlete starkly demonstrate this
reality.

Some players revel in the spot
light, the attention. Others shun
the notoriety. Although there may
appear to be more of the former
than latter, there exist a select few
athletes who genuinely do not care
for such attention, don't read what
is written or said of them and have
an uncanny ability to slip and slide
away from the bright lights. Count
Stanford men's golfer Cameron
Wilson to be among that select
group.

The only senior in head coach
Conrad Ray's lineup, Wilson will
not, in all likelihood, read this piece.
Wilson claims he doesn't follow golf
media, and when once asked, had no
knowledge of any Stanford Athlet
ics articles written about him.

A simple Google search will
demonstrate how tough it is for Wil
son to avoid himself, and under
standably so. The Rowayton, Conn,
native who has been featured by
Golf Digest, USGA and Golf Week
is currently 15th in the World
Amateur Golf Ranking and has
compiled an impressive resume
that includes 15 top-10 collegiate

tournament finishes and a qualifica
tion for the 2012 U.S. Open. Despite
the success, Wilson draws confi
dence just from his precise prepa
ration, which he is always in the
process of fine-tuning.

"There's a difference between
practicing a lot and working hard,
and working hard on the stuff that
is directly correlated with you get
ting better," Wilson said. "I know
plenty of golfers who go off-track
working on stuff that isn't closely
enough related to hitting better
shots, as simple as that sounds. I've
just done a really good job lately of
focusing only on the things I need
to focus on."

Indeed, Wilson has taken "a
more numbers-based approach," fo
cusing on the technical aspects of
his game and pinpointing exactly
what is necessary to hit the ball far
ther and with more accuracy. This
process certainly falls in line with
Ray's statistical methods, and Wil
son has improved his game by leaps
and bounds as a result.

"He's really matured as a player
over the last four years, both physi
cally and technically," Ray said. "I
think he's become a real student of
the game, which is neat to see. He
loves to hear new theories about
swing mechanics, different ways to
play, and he's done a great job of

figuring out what his method for
success is... he really is a great, ef
ficient worker at the game."
Particularly at a school like
Stanford, efficiency is the name of
the game. Class and schoolwork
commitments along with practice
and competition time tend to fill, if
not completely overflow, a student
athlete's schedule.

And it's this aspect of balancing
a term deeply embedded in the
student-athlete vernacular ath
letic and academic interests that
Wilson points to as the most chal
lenging thing he's had to overcome
as a Cardinal, even tougher than a
back injury that plagued him dur
ing the summer between his sopho
more and junior seasons.
"I think the hardest thing about
playing collegiate golf here is the
time commitment is huge [for aca
demics]," Wilson said. "I'm sure
every Stanford athlete can commis
erate with this, but the people we're
competing against have way less
time commitment for their school
work, and so that can be a hurdle
sometimes ... And I think balancing
all of that [academics and athletics]
is well worth it but it's a tough thing
to figure out in the beginning."

But Wilson did have to wade his
way through the complicated
process of aligning class schedule

with practice and tournaments ear
ly on, as Ray immediately thrust
the freshman into the starting line
up. Wilson, for his part, played as
well as one could have expected
from a first-year player, recording
the fourth-best scoring average on
the squad while notching two top-10
finishes.

He has improved those numbers
every year since, a steady ascent
that culminated in his first NCAA
individual victory in September at
the Illini Invitational. This year es
pecially, though, Wilson has not just
developed his own game, but also
his leadership acumen filling the
void left by veterans Andrew Yun
and Steve Kearney.
"I've enjoyed being the lone sen
ior, which is kind of a weird
thought," Wilson said. "I feel like I
have a good amount of knowledge
to impart on the younger guys and
I've played most of these golf cours
es ... I'm not afraid to give them a
kick in the rear end if I think that's
what they need. But I hope that my
devotion to the details rubs off on
them."

Wilson's mastery of all the so
called "little things" has not gone
unnoticed to Ray, who always has
high praise for one of Stanford's
most consistent, cool, calm and col-

lected players in recent memory.

And the coach hopes that his se
nior's last postseason go-around is
finally fruitful.
"We're excited to have a good
run here at the end of the year and
I know Cameron's really motivated
to do what he can do to be a major
part of a national championship
run," Ray said.
At the end of the day, though,
hoisting a trophy in late May will
not define Cameron Wilson's mar
velous career as a Stanford golfer.
It won't make or break his overall
experience on The Farm. That's be
cause Wilson unlike a majority of
his athlete peers does not yearn
for personal recognition. Instead,
he wants to be known as a player
who took every opportunity to bet
ter himself for not only himself, but
also the greater good of the team.

"I want to be remembered as a
hard worker and a guy that ex
plored every avenue to get better,"
Wilson said. "Didn't leave any
stone unturned; trying to find more
information or new ways to prac
tice or new ways to look at my
game. I just want to be known as a
guy that explored all his options
and did some innovative things to
play my best."

unnoticed to Ray, who always has
high praise for one of Stanford's
most consistent, cool, calm and col-

lected players in recent memory.

And the coach hopes that his se
nior's last postseason go-around is
finally fruitful.
"We're excited to have a good
run here at the end of the year and
I know Cameron's really motivated
to do what he can do to be a major
part of a national championship
run," Ray said.
At the end of the day, though,
hoisting a trophy in late May will
not define Cameron Wilson's mar
velous career as a Stanford golfer.
It won't make or break his overall
experience on The Farm. That's be
cause Wilson unlike a majority of
his athlete peers does not yearn
for personal recognition. Instead,
he wants to be known as a player
who took every opportunity to bet
ter himself for not only himself, but
also the greater good of the team.

"I want to be remembered as a
hard worker and a guy that ex
plored every avenue to get better,"
Wilson said. "Didn't leave any
stone unturned; trying to find more
information or new ways to prac
tice or new ways to look at my
game. I just want to be known as a
guy that explored all his options
and did some innovative things to
play my best."

Whether they like it
or not, athletes are
entertainers — not
too different from A
musicians or ac- pj
tors. While many onlookers like to "w
think that the sports world stands
alone, its players are ultimately en
veloped by the cavernous umbrella of
the entertainment industry. Rabid
fans, inquiring media and the relative
fame that can be gained simply by be
ing an athlete starkly demonstrate this
reality.

Some players revel in the spot
light, the attention. Others shun
the notoriety. Although there may
appear to be more of the former
than latter, there exist a select few
athletes who genuinely do not care
for such attention, don't read what
is written or said of them and have
an uncanny ability to slip and slide
away from the bright lights. Count
Stanford men's golfer Cameron
Wilson to be among that select
group.

The only senior in head coach
Conrad Ray's lineup, Wilson will
not, in all likelihood, read this piece.
Wilson claims he doesn't follow golf
media, and when once asked, had no
knowledge of any Stanford Athlet
ics articles written about him.

A simple Google search will
demonstrate how tough it is for Wil
son to avoid himself, and under
standably so. The Rowayton, Conn,
native who has been featured by
Golf Digest, USGA and Golf Week
is currently 15th in the World
Amateur Golf Ranking and has
compiled an impressive resume
that includes 15 top-10 collegiate

tournament finishes and a qualifica
tion for the 2012 U.S. Open. Despite
the success, Wilson draws confi
dence just from his precise prepa
ration, which he is always in the
process of fine-tuning.

"There's a difference between
practicing a lot and working hard,
and working hard on the stuff that
is directly correlated with you get
ting better," Wilson said. "I know
plenty of golfers who go off-track
working on stuff that isn't closely
enough related to hitting better
shots, as simple as that sounds. I've
just done a really good job lately of
focusing only on the things I need
to focus on."

Indeed, Wilson has taken "a
more numbers-based approach," fo
cusing on the technical aspects of
his game and pinpointing exactly
what is necessary to hit the ball far
ther and with more accuracy. This
process certainly falls in line with
Ray's statistical methods, and Wil
son has improved his game by leaps
and bounds as a result.

"He's really matured as a player
over the last four years, both physi
cally and technically," Ray said. "I
think he's become a real student of
the game, which is neat to see. He
loves to hear new theories about
swing mechanics, different ways to
play, and he's done a great job of

figuring out what his method for
success is... he really is a great, ef
ficient worker at the game."
Particularly at a school like
Stanford, efficiency is the name of
the game. Class and schoolwork
commitments along with practice
and competition time tend to fill, if
not completely overflow, a student
athlete's schedule.

And it's this aspect of balancing
a term deeply embedded in the
student-athlete vernacular ath
letic and academic interests that
Wilson points to as the most chal
lenging thing he's had to overcome
as a Cardinal, even tougher than a
back injury that plagued him dur
ing the summer between his sopho
more and junior seasons.
"I think the hardest thing about
playing collegiate golf here is the
time commitment is huge [for aca
demics]," Wilson said. "I'm sure
every Stanford athlete can commis
erate with this, but the people we're
competing against have way less
time commitment for their school
work, and so that can be a hurdle
sometimes ... And I think balancing
all of that [academics and athletics]
is well worth it but it's a tough thing
to figure out in the beginning."

But Wilson did have to wade his
way through the complicated
process of aligning class schedule

with practice and tournaments ear
ly on, as Ray immediately thrust
the freshman into the starting line
up. Wilson, for his part, played as
well as one could have expected
from a first-year player, recording
the fourth-best scoring average on
the squad while notching two top-10
finishes.

He has improved those numbers
every year since, a steady ascent
that culminated in his first NCAA
individual victory in September at
the Illini Invitational. This year es
pecially, though, Wilson has not just
developed his own game, but also
his leadership acumen filling the
void left by veterans Andrew Yun
and Steve Kearney.
"I've enjoyed being the lone sen
ior, which is kind of a weird
thought," Wilson said. "I feel like I
have a good amount of knowledge
to impart on the younger guys and
I've played most of these golf cours
es ... I'm not afraid to give them a
kick in the rear end if I think that's
what they need. But I hope that my
devotion to the details rubs off on
them."
