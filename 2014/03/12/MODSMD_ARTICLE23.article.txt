# It's the most magical time of the year

There's something magical
about March Madness.
When else would we close
ly follow a Butler versus
Bueknell matchup? When
else would we realize that there's a
school named Florida Gulf Coast?
And when else could I convince my
mom to join the family in trying to
predict the results of 67 basketball
games?

Each and every year, March
Madness captivates us for several
weeks distracting us from work,
school and really anything produc
tive â€” with intriguing new story
lines, clutch superstars and an eter
nally strong format. There is more
than likely a correlation between
my lowest grade ever on a final and
the start of March Madness the day
before that final in winter quarter
of last year.
March Madness' fast-paced,
win-or-go-home format produces
nonstop action and provides easily
the best playoff format in all of
sports. While its championship
might not be nearly as exciting as
the Super Bowl, the process of
reaching the championship in
March Madness entails the most
action, with five victories (not
counting some teams' play-ins)
needed to reach the NCAA title
game in just a short period of time.
And of course, March Madness
allows us to dream of creating the
perfect bracket and winning War
ren Buffet's sl-billion prize. The
thrill that accompanies a bracket
turning out just like you predicted
draws millions of people to hastily
pencil in teams they may have nev
er even heard of before. Friends
and families create groups to see
who can make the most accurate
bracket. Even the President gets
involved in filling out brackets. ES
PN dedicates shows to bracket ad
vice. The word "bracketology" has
become a common phrase despite
its absence from the dictionary.
The number of people who fol
low March Madness also complete
ly blows away the number of people
who follow regular-season college
basketball. While many sports fans
closely follow their favorite college
basketball teams, others choose to
wait until March Madness to show
interest in college basketball, only
occasionally checking results
throughout the season to help them
create their brackets down the
road. The Super Bowl is similar in
this regard, but the entire NFL
playoff format is not. March Mad
ness appeals to uninformed fans
who don't know the difference be
tween Kentucky and Western Ken
tucky, and avid college basketball
fans alike.

In addition to having the perfect
format, March Madness seemingly
never runs out of impeccable story
lines. Over recent years, we've seen
the rise of the underdogs with
schools like George Mason, Butler
and VCU making unheard of runs
to the Final Four. We've also wit
nessed the crowning of many su
perstars, such as Carmelo Anthony
with Syracuse and Stephen Curry
with Davidson.

Is there anything that America
loves more in sports than under
dogs and superstars? Nothing
beats the storyline that accompa
nies an underdog facing a super
star, like North Carolina State de
feating Hakeem Olajuwon's Hous
ton, or an underdog team with a su
perstar player, like Stephen Curry
on Davidson. March Madness
brings out the greatest underdog
stories of any sport with its little
rest, single-elimination format that
allows underdogs who get hot at
the right time to roll quickly toward
the Final Four before they can lose
momentum.

This year, March Madness is as
superstar-filled as in any past
years. Doug McDermott, the likely
Wooden Award winner and only the
eighth player to ever score 3,000
points, leads his Creighton Blue
jays into the tournament. Arguably
the greatest freshman class in his
tory, with the likes of future NBA
stars Jabari Parker, Andrew Wig
gins, Joel Embiid, Aaron Gordon
and Tyler Ennis, enters with each
player's team in relatively good po
sitioning to make a run to the Final
Four.

The storylines aren't lacking in
the upcoming March Madness ei
ther. Wichita State became the first
team to finish its regular season a
