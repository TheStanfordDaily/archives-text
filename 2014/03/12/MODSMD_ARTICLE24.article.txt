# HISTORIC EARLY EXIT
## Card ousted by Trojans in semis 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
The No. 1 seeded Stanford
women's basketball team was forced
to leave Seattle a day earlier than
expected when it lost to USC in the
semifinals of the Pac-12 Women's
Basketball Tournament. The No. 5
seed, USC, had just upset No. 4 seed
Arizona State in the quarterfinals to
put itself in a good position to capi
talize off of its victory and retain mo
mentum heading into its matchup
with the Cardinal and capitalize it
did. USC beat the Cardinal 72-68 in
a game that was a battle from the
beginning, with seven lead changes
and seven tie scores throughout the
course of the game.

In a fashion reminiscent of its
quarterfinal game against Colorado
the day before, the Card struggled
to dominate after winning the open
ing tip. Their largest lead of the
game was by six with 3:13 remaining
in the first half. Stanford, however,
was not able to maintain the lead
heading into halftime after USC's
leading scorer, junior Ariya Crook,
later scored eight straight points to
tie the game up at 32.
Crook finished the game with 15
points, 13 of which were scored in
the first half. The true standout for
the Trojans, however, was Alexyz
Yaioletama, who led the Trojans in
scoring with 19 points. The game es
sentially boiled down to a battle of

the bigs as Vaioletama and Stanford
senior forward Chiney Ogwumike
fought for postion throughout the
game. The two practically matched
each other point for point and re
bound for rebound in the final min
utes of the game, as Stanford and
USC traded baskets with neither
team able to secure a comfortable
lead.
Stanford had a slow start to the
second half, opening the period
shooting just 2-of-15 in the first 10
minutes, allowing USC to build a 10-
point lead. Stanford shot just 31.9
percent throughout the game, its
lowest output in any single game this
season.

Trailing and shooting poorly
against the Trojans was not unfamil
iar territory for the Cardinal this
season, however, as they had over
come a 17-point deficit at the Galen
Center last month for the NCAA's
eighth-greatest comeback win. In
the semifinal game of the tourna
ment, in order for USC to win the
third meeting of the teams, it had to
play aggressive and high-intensity
basketball for 40 minutes. Ultimate
ly, whichever team could maintain a
high level of play for the entire con
test was the one that would prevail.
"We played hard, but like coach
said before the game, it's not just
about playing hard; we have to exe
cute," said Ogwumike. "It's unfortu
nate to not win a Pac-12 Tournament
championship, but we'll use this
game moving forward."
Ogwumike tied the Pac-12 career
scoring record with her 30-point, 21-
rebound performance, but head
coach Tara VanDerveer explained
that the National Player of the Year
candidate needed more consistent
support throughout the game from
teammates in order for the Card to

FRANK CHEN/The Stanford Daily
Freshman guard Lili Thompson (above), named to the Pac- 12's All-Freshman
team, scored 13 points and had a game-high four assists in Stanford's
72-68 loss to USC in the semifinals of the conference tournament.
have secured the win.
"Chiney battled and she was a
warrior for us. Amber [Orrange]
and Lili [Thompson] both made
some big plays for us," VanDerveer
said. "We did not shoot the ball
well. I thought we worked hard on
defense, but offensively we really
struggled. We have to have other
people steeping up, more offensive
contributors. We're not moving the
ball well."

Freshman Lili Thompson fin
ished as the second leading scorer
for the Card with 13 points and
four assists, including a pair of free
throws that put the Card up by
three with 5:06 to play, at which
point both teams started trading
points.

The momentum finally picked a
team several minutes later, howev
er, when Trojan forward Cassie
Harberts, who had only scored
three points up until that point,
netted 10 points over a span of two
minutes to give the Trojans a 67-60
lead with just 1:23 left in regula
tion.

USC, however, missed key free
throws in the final stretch of the
game to give Stanford the opportu
nity to come up with a second
come-from-behind victory over the
Trojans this season, and in re
sponse, Thompson hit a jumper
with under 30 seconds left to put
the Card within two. However, the
Cardinal could not execute in the

end, as there was visible confusion
between the coaching staff and
players as to what plays to run, in
cluding on an inbound pass. A des
peration 3-point attempt from Og
wumike with three seconds re
maining was just off the mark and
the Trojans advanced to the finals
of the Pac-12 Tournament with the
stunning victory.
Sunday's championship game
between the No. 3 seed Oregon
State and USC was the first final
game since the tournament's incep
tion 13 years ago that didn't fea
ture the Cardinal. Stanford had
won the Pac-12 Tournament in 11
of those 13 years.
Another consequence was that

with the unexpected loss last week
end, a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tour
nament is no longer a guarantee.
"We're not going to worry about
seeding; we are going to worry
about getting our team ready and
working hard, figuring out what
shots we want to take and we can
improve a lot in two weeks," said
VanDerveer.
The Cardinal will have a two
week break to prepare for the first
and second rounds of the NCAA
Tournament and will await the se
lection show on Monday to learn of
its seeding in the tournament.
