## FRESHMAN TRIO TAKES BIG ROLE IN TITLE DEFENSE 
### FIONA NOONAN STAFF WRITER 
When freshmen
Taylor David
son, Caroline
Doyle and Car
ol Zhao arrived
on the Farm for their recruiting
trip over a year ago, they knew
that Stanford and its storied
women's tennis program was the
right place for them.
Of course, the prestige of play
ing for one of the country's best
tennis programs held an allure of
its own, but beyond that, the three
student-athletes found another
reason for committing: each other.

From the start, the three fresh
men have had a strong dynamic
and have helped each other tra
verse the difficulties of being a
student-athlete at Stanford.

Given that Davidson, Doyle
and Zhao now consist of half of the
team's lineup, are each ranked in
the top-35 individually nationally
and have combined to go 22-2 in
singles dual matches this season,
Stanford could not have asked for
a better freshman class.

Davidson, Doyle and Zhao each
come from very different places
and backgrounds. Davidson hails
from Statesville, N.C., where she
would drive 50 minutes to and
from practice every day in order
to stay with her coach, who was

based in Winston-Salem.
Doyle, who is from San Fran
cisco, took a different route, play
ing in the Bay Area for years be
fore beginning to train at the US
TA Training Center in Boca Ra
ton, Fla. She stayed there for two
years, graduated high school in
just three and joined the Cardinal
along with two former opponents
in Zhao and Davidson.

Zhao, who hails from Ontario,
Canada the team's only inter
national player trained at
Canada's national tennis center
for three years before coming to
Stanford, all the while balancing
rigorous academics and dedication
