## FRESHMAN TRIO TAKES BIG ROLE IN TITLE DEFENSE 
### FIONA NOONAN STAFF WRITER 
When freshmen
Taylor David
son, Caroline
Doyle and Car
ol Zhao arrived
on the Farm for their recruiting
trip over a year ago, they knew
that Stanford and its storied
women's tennis program was the
right place for them.
Of course, the prestige of play
ing for one of the country's best
tennis programs held an allure of
its own, but beyond that, the three
student-athletes found another
reason for committing: each other.

From the start, the three fresh
men have had a strong dynamic
and have helped each other tra
verse the difficulties of being a
student-athlete at Stanford.

Given that Davidson, Doyle
and Zhao now consist of half of the
team's lineup, are each ranked in
the top-35 individually nationally
and have combined to go 22-2 in
singles dual matches this season,
Stanford could not have asked for
a better freshman class.

Davidson, Doyle and Zhao each
come from very different places
and backgrounds. Davidson hails
from Statesville, N.C., where she
would drive 50 minutes to and
from practice every day in order
to stay with her coach, who was

based in Winston-Salem.
Doyle, who is from San Fran
cisco, took a different route, play
ing in the Bay Area for years be
fore beginning to train at the US
TA Training Center in Boca Ra
ton, Fla. She stayed there for two
years, graduated high school in
just three and joined the Cardinal
along with two former opponents
in Zhao and Davidson.

Zhao, who hails from Ontario,
Canada the team's only inter
national player trained at
Canada's national tennis center
for three years before coming to
Stanford, all the while balancing
rigorous academics and dedication

to athletics, just like the other two
freshmen.
Despite their disparate routes to
Stanford, each of them became ac
customed to similarly intense and
individual tennis careers during
high school. They all travelled wide
ly, played at the highest levels of na
tional competition and relied on on
ly themselves to achieve success.
"It became a job, but it was a fun
job," Davidson said.
Yet playing for Stanford now, the
student-athletes have been intro
duced to an entirely different team
dynamic and paradigm of success.
"On the national team, we'd
travel 20-25 weeks out of the year,"
Zhao said. "[Going from] having to
do that and deal with everything
yourself to having a whole group of
girls behind you, it's a nice thing."

"It's really awesome being in an
atmosphere where you're training
with the best, but they want what's
best for you equally as much as
they want what's best for them
selves to create the best team,"
echoed Doyle.
All three of them have enjoyed
the feeling of team support from
each other and their five non-fresh
man teammates. Given the college
tennis format, strong team bonds
and relationships are critical a
team only wins a match by earning
four points, which are based off of
singles match victories or earning
the doubles point by winning two
out of three doubles matches.

Total victory is a team effort,
where no one point counts more or
less than any other, but matches re
main individual at them core, which
can be an interesting balance to
master.

"You can't be looking at the
scoreboard and thinking, 'Oh, well
if we have four matches that we're
going to win already I can just give

up and not try,'" Davidson said.
"You still play for your team, but
you're still playing for yourself at
the same time."

Such a supportive environment
has been key going into games,
where the freshmen alone can earn
three quarters of the points neces
sary for a team victory. Underlying
this support is the added motivation
to succeed for Stanford, where ex
cellence has become an expectation
for the women's tennis team.
Head coach Lele Forood main
tains the caliber by holding the
team to a very high standard, but at
the same time, the freshmen all de
scribe the team as flexible and indi
vidualized to match each player's
needs.

Before big matches like the Car
dinal's recent 7-0 annihilation of
perennial rival No. 2 Florida, the
coaches help each player with spe
cific skills she would like to polish,
the team eats dinner together and
they all stick to the same pre-match
routine to establish a routine.

Through it all, Davidson, Doyle
and Zhao also have had role models
in the five older players on the
team, especially seniors Amelia
Herring and fifth-ranked Rristie
Ahn. Even before then- first match
es of the season, the three freshmen
understood the legacy to which
they would be contributing.
"It's pretty unreal going into
this school, the reigning national
champions, and more so, the most
decorated tennis program in the
country," Doyle said. "Especially
growing up in the Bay Area, I've al
ways loved Stanford, so stepping
onto the campus for the first time
was just so amazing."

The three all share the surreal
feeling of having such a large role in
a program that has won eighteen
national championships includ
ing last year's, which maintained
the university's 37-year-long streak
of winning at least one national
championship.
There's also a sense of respect
from other schools that affects the
team and is a new feeling for the
three freshmen.

"If we play an away match,
every single time we go some
where, it's that school's biggest
match" Davidson said. "It's a cool
feeling just being one of the top
schools that people look at like
that."

Over the next three years, the
freshmen will remain an integral
part of the women's tennis pro
gram, especially as leaders. The
close relationships that they have
established this year will only help
their success in leading the team as
a whole.

Despite the team's low-key
presence on a campus so dominated
by football and basketball, the
three are ready to do what it takes
to win on them own terms, and to
fulfill the high expectations they've
set for themselves.

"For us, it's not our goal to be
the headline of everything," Zhao
said. "We need to do what we need
to do to win matches, and that's the
most important thing."

part of the women's tennis pro
gram, especially as leaders. The
close relationships that they have
established this year will only help
their success in leading the team as
a whole.

Despite the team's low-key
presence on a campus so dominated
by football and basketball, the
three are ready to do what it takes
to win on them own terms, and to
fulfill the high expectations they've
set for themselves.

"For us, it's not our goal to be
the headline of everything," Zhao
said. "We need to do what we need
to do to win matches, and that's the
most important thing."

When freshmen
Taylor David
son, Caroline
Doyle and Car
ol Zhao arrived
on the Farm for their recruiting
trip over a year ago, they knew
that Stanford and its storied
women's tennis program was the
right place for them.
Of course, the prestige of play
ing for one of the country's best
tennis programs held an allure of
its own, but beyond that, the three
student-athletes found another
reason for committing: each other.

From the start, the three fresh
men have had a strong dynamic
and have helped each other tra
verse the difficulties of being a
student-athlete at Stanford.

Given that Davidson, Doyle
and Zhao now consist of half of the
team's lineup, are each ranked in
the top-35 individually nationally
and have combined to go 22-2 in
singles dual matches this season,
Stanford could not have asked for
a better freshman class.

Davidson, Doyle and Zhao each
come from very different places
and backgrounds. Davidson hails
from Statesville, N.C., where she
would drive 50 minutes to and
from practice every day in order
to stay with her coach, who was

based in Winston-Salem.
Doyle, who is from San Fran
cisco, took a different route, play
ing in the Bay Area for years be
fore beginning to train at the US
TA Training Center in Boca Ra
ton, Fla. She stayed there for two
years, graduated high school in
just three and joined the Cardinal
along with two former opponents
in Zhao and Davidson.

Zhao, who hails from Ontario,
Canada the team's only inter
national player trained at
Canada's national tennis center
for three years before coming to
Stanford, all the while balancing
rigorous academics and dedication

to athletics, just like the other two
freshmen.
Despite their disparate routes to
Stanford, each of them became ac
customed to similarly intense and
individual tennis careers during
high school. They all travelled wide
ly, played at the highest levels of na
tional competition and relied on on
ly themselves to achieve success.
"It became a job, but it was a fun
job," Davidson said.
Yet playing for Stanford now, the
student-athletes have been intro
duced to an entirely different team
dynamic and paradigm of success.
"On the national team, we'd
travel 20-25 weeks out of the year,"
Zhao said. "[Going from] having to
do that and deal with everything
yourself to having a whole group of
girls behind you, it's a nice thing."

"It's really awesome being in an
atmosphere where you're training
with the best, but they want what's
best for you equally as much as
they want what's best for them
selves to create the best team,"
echoed Doyle.
All three of them have enjoyed
the feeling of team support from
each other and their five non-fresh
man teammates. Given the college
tennis format, strong team bonds
and relationships are critical a
team only wins a match by earning
four points, which are based off of
singles match victories or earning
the doubles point by winning two
out of three doubles matches.

Total victory is a team effort,
where no one point counts more or
less than any other, but matches re
main individual at them core, which
can be an interesting balance to
master.

"You can't be looking at the
scoreboard and thinking, 'Oh, well
if we have four matches that we're
going to win already I can just give

up and not try,'" Davidson said.
"You still play for your team, but
you're still playing for yourself at
the same time."

Such a supportive environment
has been key going into games,
where the freshmen alone can earn
three quarters of the points neces
sary for a team victory. Underlying
this support is the added motivation
to succeed for Stanford, where ex
cellence has become an expectation
for the women's tennis team.
Head coach Lele Forood main
tains the caliber by holding the
team to a very high standard, but at
the same time, the freshmen all de
scribe the team as flexible and indi
vidualized to match each player's
needs.

Before big matches like the Car
dinal's recent 7-0 annihilation of
perennial rival No. 2 Florida, the
coaches help each player with spe
cific skills she would like to polish,
the team eats dinner together and
they all stick to the same pre-match
routine to establish a routine.

Through it all, Davidson, Doyle
and Zhao also have had role models
in the five older players on the
team, especially seniors Amelia
Herring and fifth-ranked Rristie
Ahn. Even before then- first match
es of the season, the three freshmen
understood the legacy to which
they would be contributing.
"It's pretty unreal going into
this school, the reigning national
champions, and more so, the most
decorated tennis program in the
country," Doyle said. "Especially
growing up in the Bay Area, I've al
ways loved Stanford, so stepping
onto the campus for the first time
was just so amazing."

The three all share the surreal
feeling of having such a large role in
a program that has won eighteen
national championships includ
ing last year's, which maintained
the university's 37-year-long streak
of winning at least one national
championship.
There's also a sense of respect
from other schools that affects the
team and is a new feeling for the
three freshmen.

"If we play an away match,
every single time we go some
where, it's that school's biggest
match" Davidson said. "It's a cool
feeling just being one of the top
schools that people look at like
that."

Over the next three years, the
freshmen will remain an integral
part of the women's tennis pro
gram, especially as leaders. The
close relationships that they have
established this year will only help
their success in leading the team as
