## Quantrill's gem caps Card's first series win 
### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
It was all smiles for Stanford's
baseball team on Sunday after
noon, as freshman Cal Quantrill's
dominant 126-pitch shutout the
Cardinal's first since Mark Appel
'l3 went the distance on Mai*. 28,
2013 capped off the team's first
series win of the season.
"It was a great job and he got
stronger as the game went on,"
said head coach Mark Marquess.
"He was stronger in the last three
or four innings than in the first five
or six."

Although Kansas en
tered the three-game set ranked in
the top-10 nationally in multiple
major offensive statistical cate
gories (including batting average,
slugging percentage and total
scoring), Stanford's pitching domi
nated Jayhawk hitters throughout
the series, allowing just four
earned runs over 31 combined in
nings (1.16 ERA). The Cardinal
starters were particularly effec
tive, as they did not allow an
earned run over 19 innings
pitched.

While Stanford was just a sacri
fice fly away from taking Friday's
game in extra innings twice, it bat
tled back from the 4-2 13-inning
loss to take the next two games in
the set, 5-4 and 1-0, to head into
their two-week break on a high

note.
Friday's extra-inning marathon
started out as a pitchers' duel, with
neither team getting a run across
the plate until the eighth inning.
Freshman Brett Hanewich got the
start to open the series and had his
best outing of the year under the
lights.

Hanewich was dominant early,
retiring the first 10 hitters he
faced by throwing strikes and get
ting into advantageous counts. He
lowered his ERA to 1.93 after ty
ing his longest outing of the season
by going 5.1 innings, allowing no
runs and just three hits.
Sophomore Marcus Brakeman
replaced the freshman starter in
the sixth inning with runners on
second and third and only one out,
but was able to get out of the jam
to hold the Jayhawks scoreless
through six.
Kansas was also threatening in
the seventh with runners on first
and second and one out, when a fly
ball hit by sophomore Jacob Boy
lan to left looked like it would give
them the lead. But senior left field
er Brett Michael Doran ranged
back and made an over-the-shoul
der catch, starting a garden-vari
ety 7-6-4 double play to once again
spare the Card.
In the eighth, Kansas rallied
with two outs after a walk surren
dered by Brakeman was followed
up with an opposite-field RBI
triple. An error scored both Jay
hawk players, giving Kansas a 2-0
lead.

The Cardinal were down 2-1 in
the bottom of the ninth and looked
like they were in business after a

leadoff double from freshman Alex
Dunlap. A perfectly placed bunt by
freshman Tommy Edman ad
vanced Dunlap to third, and Mar
quess then sent up senior Brant
Whiting in a big pinch-hit opportu
nity. Whiting delivered with a
game-tying single on a two-strike
count to send the game into extras.
"With two strikes, I just had to
battle. I got a good pitch to hit, and
put it in play," Whiting said. "It's a
different mindset... but I'm always
prepared [to pinch hit] —we all
have to be because we're all trying
to help the team win."
But from then on, the story for
Stanford was simply one of missed
opportunities. The Cardinal loaded
the bases in both the 11th and 12th
innings, first with one out and then
with no outs. Yet both times, they
weren't able to score the winning
run from third. Stanford left 13
runners on base in the game, eight
of them in scoring position.

Stanford's five defensive er
rors, nine walks allowed and a hit
by pitch all unforced errors in
areas the players could control
also set the team back in game one,
a seemingly ongoing trend this
season. 49 percent (32 of 65) of op
posing hitters that have scored
against the Cardinal this season
have reached base via a defensive
error, walk or hit by pitch.

Kansas took a two-run lead in
the top of the 13th and then shut
out the Card in the bottom half to
take the series-opening win.

Kansas miscues a combination of
walks and a hit by pitch allowed by
their starter in addition to multiple
defensive errors. They scored one in
the first, one in the second and three
in the third to hand freshman
starter Chris Viall a 5-0 lead.
The freshman was forced from
the game after 4.2 innings when an
error by sophomore shortstop Drew
Jackson opened the floodgates and
led to three unearned Kansas runs.
Viall was able to get out of multiple

jams not allowing an earned run
despite surrendering four hits
and four walks.
While Kansas later narrowed
the gap to 5-4 and threatened in the
ninth against freshman Tyler
Thorne, who was called in for the
save opportunity, a 6-3 double play
with one out in the top of the ninth
secured the Cardinal victory.

The series finale was also a
pitchers' duel, as both starters
pitched complete games and a sin
gle run was enough to provide the
margin of victory. It came in the bot
tom of the fourth, when senior first
baseman Danny Diekroeger, who
leads the team with 12 runs scored
and a .500 on-base percentage, led

off with a single and was eventually
singled home by Dunlap with two
outs.

Quantrill provided the Cardinal
with their best start of the season,
throwing a complete-game shutout
in which he allowed just four hits
and struck out seven. A lot of his re
cent success has been a product of
effectively mixing his pitches, espe
cially his breaking ball early in
counts.

"The slider for me is a first-year
pitch, so it's taken some time to get
used to how and when to use it,"
Quantrill said. "[Pitching coach
Rusty Filter] has done a great job of
working it in early... to put [oppos
ing hitters] in counts where they

weren't ready for the heater, which
worked well."

For Quantrill, the first Stanford
freshman to start an Opening Day
game since 1988, this season has
been a progression, even after just
five starts.

"It's college baseball it was a
little different. Maybe the adrena
line, maybe I was getting a bit
worked up, but I'm good," he said.
"I've got those [first couple of
starts] behind me, and now I feel
like we're ready to get on a roll here
and start turning around the sea
son."

faced by throwing strikes and get
ting into advantageous counts. He
lowered his ERA to 1.93 after ty
ing his longest outing of the season
by going 5.1 innings, allowing no
runs and just three hits.
Sophomore Marcus Brakeman
replaced the freshman starter in
the sixth inning with runners on
second and third and only one out,
but was able to get out of the jam
to hold the Jayhawks scoreless
through six.
Kansas was also threatening in
the seventh with runners on first
and second and one out, when a fly
ball hit by sophomore Jacob Boy
lan to left looked like it would give
them the lead. But senior left field
er Brett Michael Doran ranged
back and made an over-the-shoul
der catch, starting a garden-vari
ety 7-6-4 double play to once again
spare the Card.
In the eighth, Kansas rallied
with two outs after a walk surren
dered by Brakeman was followed
up with an opposite-field RBI
triple. An error scored both Jay
hawk players, giving Kansas a 2-0
lead.

The Cardinal were down 2-1 in
the bottom of the ninth and looked
like they were in business after a

leadoff double from freshman Alex
Dunlap. A perfectly placed bunt by
freshman Tommy Edman ad
vanced Dunlap to third, and Mar
quess then sent up senior Brant
Whiting in a big pinch-hit opportu
nity. Whiting delivered with a
game-tying single on a two-strike
count to send the game into extras.
"With two strikes, I just had to
battle. I got a good pitch to hit, and
put it in play," Whiting said. "It's a
different mindset... but I'm always
prepared [to pinch hit] —we all
have to be because we're all trying
to help the team win."
But from then on, the story for
Stanford was simply one of missed
opportunities. The Cardinal loaded
the bases in both the 11th and 12th
innings, first with one out and then
with no outs. Yet both times, they
weren't able to score the winning
run from third. Stanford left 13
runners on base in the game, eight
of them in scoring position.

Stanford's five defensive er
rors, nine walks allowed and a hit
by pitch all unforced errors in
areas the players could control
also set the team back in game one,
a seemingly ongoing trend this
season. 49 percent (32 of 65) of op
posing hitters that have scored
against the Cardinal this season
have reached base via a defensive
error, walk or hit by pitch.

Kansas took a two-run lead in
the top of the 13th and then shut
out the Card in the bottom half to
take the series-opening win.

Kansas miscues a combination of
walks and a hit by pitch allowed by
their starter in addition to multiple
defensive errors. They scored one in
the first, one in the second and three
in the third to hand freshman
starter Chris Viall a 5-0 lead.
The freshman was forced from
the game after 4.2 innings when an
error by sophomore shortstop Drew
Jackson opened the floodgates and
led to three unearned Kansas runs.
Viall was able to get out of multiple

jams not allowing an earned run
despite surrendering four hits
and four walks.
While Kansas later narrowed
the gap to 5-4 and threatened in the
ninth against freshman Tyler
Thorne, who was called in for the
save opportunity, a 6-3 double play
with one out in the top of the ninth
secured the Cardinal victory.

The series finale was also a
pitchers' duel, as both starters
pitched complete games and a sin
gle run was enough to provide the
margin of victory. It came in the bot
tom of the fourth, when senior first
baseman Danny Diekroeger, who
leads the team with 12 runs scored
and a .500 on-base percentage, led

off with a single and was eventually
singled home by Dunlap with two
outs.

Quantrill provided the Cardinal
with their best start of the season,
throwing a complete-game shutout
in which he allowed just four hits
and struck out seven. A lot of his re
cent success has been a product of
effectively mixing his pitches, espe
cially his breaking ball early in
counts.

"The slider for me is a first-year
pitch, so it's taken some time to get
used to how and when to use it,"
Quantrill said. "[Pitching coach
Rusty Filter] has done a great job of
working it in early... to put [oppos
ing hitters] in counts where they

weren't ready for the heater, which
worked well."

For Quantrill, the first Stanford
freshman to start an Opening Day
game since 1988, this season has
been a progression, even after just
five starts.

"It's college baseball it was a
little different. Maybe the adrena
line, maybe I was getting a bit
worked up, but I'm good," he said.
"I've got those [first couple of

like we're ready to get on a roll here
and start turning around the sea
son."

Pitcher Cal Qucmtrill (above), who earlier this season became the first Stanford freshman to start an Opening Day game since 1988, threw a 4-hit,
126-pitch shutout against Kansas on Sunday at Sunken Diamond. The Cardinal's 1-0 win secured the team's first series win this year.
It was all smiles for Stanford's
baseball team on Sunday after
noon, as freshman Cal Quantrill's
dominant 126-pitch shutout the
Cardinal's first since Mark Appel
'l3 went the distance on Mai*. 28,
2013 capped off the team's first
series win of the season.
"It was a great job and he got
stronger as the game went on,"
said head coach Mark Marquess.
"He was stronger in the last three
or four innings than in the first five
or six."

Although Kansas en
tered the three-game set ranked in
the top-10 nationally in multiple
major offensive statistical cate
gories (including batting average,
slugging percentage and total
scoring), Stanford's pitching domi
nated Jayhawk hitters throughout
the series, allowing just four
earned runs over 31 combined in
nings (1.16 ERA). The Cardinal
starters were particularly effec
tive, as they did not allow an
earned run over 19 innings
pitched.

While Stanford was just a sacri
fice fly away from taking Friday's
game in extra innings twice, it bat
tled back from the 4-2 13-inning
loss to take the next two games in
the set, 5-4 and 1-0, to head into
their two-week break on a high

note.
Friday's extra-inning marathon
started out as a pitchers' duel, with
neither team getting a run across
the plate until the eighth inning.
Freshman Brett Hanewich got the
start to open the series and had his
best outing of the year under the
lights.
