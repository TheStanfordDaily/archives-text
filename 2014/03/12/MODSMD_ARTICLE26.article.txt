## Quantrill's gem caps Card's first series win 
### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
It was all smiles for Stanford's
baseball team on Sunday after
noon, as freshman Cal Quantrill's
dominant 126-pitch shutout the
Cardinal's first since Mark Appel
'l3 went the distance on Mai*. 28,
2013 capped off the team's first
series win of the season.
"It was a great job and he got
stronger as the game went on,"
said head coach Mark Marquess.
"He was stronger in the last three
or four innings than in the first five
or six."

Although Kansas en
tered the three-game set ranked in
the top-10 nationally in multiple
major offensive statistical cate
gories (including batting average,
slugging percentage and total
scoring), Stanford's pitching domi
nated Jayhawk hitters throughout
the series, allowing just four
earned runs over 31 combined in
nings (1.16 ERA). The Cardinal
starters were particularly effec
tive, as they did not allow an
earned run over 19 innings
pitched.

While Stanford was just a sacri
fice fly away from taking Friday's
game in extra innings twice, it bat
tled back from the 4-2 13-inning
loss to take the next two games in
the set, 5-4 and 1-0, to head into
their two-week break on a high

note.
Friday's extra-inning marathon
started out as a pitchers' duel, with
neither team getting a run across
the plate until the eighth inning.
Freshman Brett Hanewich got the
start to open the series and had his
best outing of the year under the
lights.

Hanewich was dominant early,
retiring the first 10 hitters he
faced by throwing strikes and get
ting into advantageous counts. He
lowered his ERA to 1.93 after ty
ing his longest outing of the season
by going 5.1 innings, allowing no
runs and just three hits.
Sophomore Marcus Brakeman
replaced the freshman starter in
the sixth inning with runners on
second and third and only one out,
but was able to get out of the jam
to hold the Jayhawks scoreless
through six.
Kansas was also threatening in
the seventh with runners on first
and second and one out, when a fly
ball hit by sophomore Jacob Boy
lan to left looked like it would give
them the lead. But senior left field
er Brett Michael Doran ranged
back and made an over-the-shoul
der catch, starting a garden-vari
ety 7-6-4 double play to once again
spare the Card.
In the eighth, Kansas rallied
with two outs after a walk surren
dered by Brakeman was followed
up with an opposite-field RBI
triple. An error scored both Jay
hawk players, giving Kansas a 2-0
lead.

The Cardinal were down 2-1 in
the bottom of the ninth and looked
like they were in business after a

leadoff double from freshman Alex
Dunlap. A perfectly placed bunt by
freshman Tommy Edman ad
vanced Dunlap to third, and Mar
quess then sent up senior Brant
Whiting in a big pinch-hit opportu
nity. Whiting delivered with a
game-tying single on a two-strike
count to send the game into extras.
"With two strikes, I just had to
battle. I got a good pitch to hit, and
put it in play," Whiting said. "It's a
different mindset... but I'm always
prepared [to pinch hit] â€”we all
have to be because we're all trying
to help the team win."
But from then on, the story for
Stanford was simply one of missed
opportunities. The Cardinal loaded
the bases in both the 11th and 12th
innings, first with one out and then
with no outs. Yet both times, they
weren't able to score the winning
run from third. Stanford left 13
runners on base in the game, eight
of them in scoring position.

Stanford's five defensive er
rors, nine walks allowed and a hit
by pitch all unforced errors in
areas the players could control
also set the team back in game one,
a seemingly ongoing trend this
season. 49 percent (32 of 65) of op
posing hitters that have scored
against the Cardinal this season
have reached base via a defensive
error, walk or hit by pitch.

Kansas took a two-run lead in
the top of the 13th and then shut
out the Card in the bottom half to
take the series-opening win.
