Despite another individual conference champi
onship from junior David Nolan, the Stanford men's
swimming and diving squad finished in second at
the Pac-12 Championships for the second consecu
tive season, with the Cardinal's 661 points not
enough to surpass a solid showing that resulted in
786 points for Cal, which claimed its second confer
ence title in as many years.

Nolan's time of 1:41.49 in the 200-yard individual
medley (IM), arguably his best event, broke both a
meet record and a Pac-12 conference record both
of which had previously been held by Austin Staab
