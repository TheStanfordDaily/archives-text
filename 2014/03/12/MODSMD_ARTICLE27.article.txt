# Runner-up finish at Pac-12s
## 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
Despite another individual conference champi
onship from junior David Nolan, the Stanford men's
swimming and diving squad finished in second at
the Pac-12 Championships for the second consecu
tive season, with the Cardinal's 661 points not
enough to surpass a solid showing that resulted in
786 points for Cal, which claimed its second confer
ence title in as many years.

Nolan's time of 1:41.49 in the 200-yard individual
medley (IM), arguably his best event, broke both a
meet record and a Pac-12 conference record both
of which had previously been held by Austin Staab

Junior David Nolan (above) secured his third consecutive conference title in the 200-yard individual medley at the Pac- 12
Championships this past weekend. His time of 1:41 .49, a Pac- 12 record, was only two-tenths of a second off his personal best.
'll. He finished nearly two seconds
faster than any of the other swim
mers in the event, including four
Stanford teammates that had also
qualified for the "A" final after
strong showings in the heats.
Nolan's victory was never in doubt,
as he jumped out to an early lead
and distanced himself from the
pack with stellar backstroke and
freestyle legs.
The victory marked a third con
secutive Pac-12 title in the 200 IM
for Nolan, as he became only the
third athlete in conference history
to do so. However, he was disap
pointed in his other two individual
events the 100-yard backstroke
and the 200-yard backstroke as
he failed to take home multiple in
dividual titles at the conference
championship for a third straight
season.

Nolan got off to a strong start in
the 100 back and led after the first
50 yards before slowing down con
siderably in the second half of the
sprint, ultimately being out
touched by less than one-tenth of a
second by Cal freshman Ryan
Murphy. Although Nolan had set a
Pac-12 Championship record in the
200 last season, Murphy also stole
the show in that event, setting a
new meet record as both he and
Cal sophomore Jacob Pebley fin
ished ahead of Nolan, who trailed
from the start and couldn't over
come that initial gap with a strong

push in the final 50 yards.
Although the Cardinal failed to
register any victories in the finals
of any of the relay events, they had
strong performances in which they
notched NCAA "A" cut times in all
but the 200-yard freestyle relay
heading into the upcoming NCAA
Championships. While their per
formance in the finals of the 400-
yard freestyle relay was mediocre,
as they finished in sixth place

slower than even the NCAA "B"
standard the Cardinal notched
an "A" standard time in a morning
time trial in which it swam 2:52.79
to propel itself into the NCAAs.
Outside of Nolan's performance
in the 200 IM, Stanford's swim
mers as individuals did not have
any eye-popping performances.
The only other swimmer to regis
ter a top-three finish in a final was
freshman Max Williamson, who
finished third in the 400 IM while
notching an NCAA "B" standard
time.

Freshman Connor Black and
senior Mason Shaw also picked up
likely NCAA Championship bids,
with Black's time trial of 46.52 in
the 100 butterfly and Shaw's 53.31
in the 100 breaststroke both sur
passing their performances in the
finals of those events and putting
them within the range of a NCAA
"B" cut.

The qualified Cardinal swim
mers will continue to work towards
the NCAA Championships, which
will be held in Austin, Tex. from
Mar. 27 to Mar. 29.
