# SOCAL SWINGING
## Stanford rolls past Waves, Trojans 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 10 Stanford men's vol
leyball team (12-7, 9-7 MPSF)
made a statement this weekend in
Southern California, knocking off
two top-10 opponents in impres
sive performances. The Cardinal
defeated No. 4 Pepperdine in four
sets in Malibu on FViday and then
went on to sweep No. 6 USC on
Sunday for the team's first win in

the Galen Center since 2010. With
the two wins, Stanford has re
turned to the middle of the MPSF
standings heading into the final
month of conference play.

With an efficient offensive per
formance in which Stanford hit
.377 as a team, the Cardinal were
able to knock off the Pepperdine
Waves (10-5,10-5) in four sets, 25-
21, 15-25, 28-26, 25-21. Stanford

started the match off aggressively,
knowing it had to try to gain an
early advantage in order to beat a
team that had previously lost just
one game at home this season. In
that successful first set, the Cardi
nal hit .615, including 19 kills and
just three errors.
While the Cardinal struggled
in the second set, losing by 10,
they were able to regain the offen
sive power they had in the first set
to pull through the remainder of
the match and clinch the win. Al
though the Cardinal were losing
early in the third set, they
bounced back to tie the set up at
15 and never looked back.
Senior outside hitter Steven
Irvin led the Cardinal offense with
17 kills and three blocks. Fellow
seniors Brian Cook and Eric
Mochalski also contributed dou
ble-digit kills, with Cook at 16 and
Mochalski at 13.

On Sunday, Stanford swept
USC (11-7, 10-7) by continuing to
dominate with its offense, this
time in a historic manner (25-15,
25-14, 25-22). The team hit a sea
son-high .527 in the match, a mark
that ties the second-highest hit
ting percentage in program histo
ry in the rally-scoring era.
In the first set, the Cardinal
gained an early lead and separat
ed themselves with multiple runs,
the longest being a seven-point
streak. Again in the second set,
Stanford scored the first four
points and never let the Trojans
take the lead. In the final set, the
teams traded points for most of
the set until the Cardinal took a
20-18 lead and powered through to
win the game by four.

Mochalski led the Cardinal
with 18 kills and a .667 hitting per
centage. Irvin and sophomore set
ter James Shaw also added eight
kills for the night. Meanwhile,
Stanford's defense was equally im
pressive, holding USC to a .258
hitting percentage. The Cardinal
outblocked the Trojans 7-2 and al
so held USC to the lowest amount
of points it has scored in a 25-point
set all season with just 14 in the
second set.

Stanford will face both Pepper
dine and USC again in two weeks,
this time with home-court advan
tage. But first, the Cardinal will
host a doubleheader against No. 8
Hawaii on Friday and Saturday,
with both matches set for 7 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion.
