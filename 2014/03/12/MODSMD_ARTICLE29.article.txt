## Football fills coaching vacancy with veteran 
### JOSEPH BEYDA FOOTBALL EDITOR 
On Monday afternoon, Stan
ford football officially announced
that veteran Texas defensive
backs coach Duane Akina had
been hired for the same position
on the Farm.

After spending the first two
week session of spring practice
with nobody at the position, the
Cardinal's secondary will now
benefit from a 35-year coaching
veteran who has developed 28
NFL defensive backs and three
Thorpe Award winners.
Although Lance Anderson took
over for the departed Derek Ma
son, now the head coach at Van
derbilt, as Stanford's defensive co
ordinator, Akina will replace Ma
son's expertise in the secondary.
Mason originally came to the
Farm in 2010 as a defensive backs
coach.

Akina's hire was first reported
on Sunday afternoon by
247 sports.corn's Bobby Burton.
After coaching the Longhorns for

13 years under Mack Brown, who
retired at the end of last season,
Akina was not included in the new
staff being built by incoming
Texas head coach Charlie Strong.
Brown Tweeted his support on
Sunday night: "Congrats Duane.
Thx for all you did @ UT making
it DBU."

After Akina was let go, rumors
first emerged in mid-February
that he was on Stanford's shortlist,
and 247 sports.com reported on
Feb. 24 that he had been offered
the position.

The eventual hire couldn't
come a moment too soon for a Car
dinal secondary that is undergoing
anticipated if not entirely ex
pected turnover this season.
Besides Mason, Stanford will have
to replace star free safety Ed
Reynolds, who declared for the
NFL Draft in January. Although
Reynolds was one of the nation's
top safety prospects, his statistical
production took a slight downturn
last year after a breakout 2012
campaign, so some hoped that he
would return for a fifth and final

season to bolster his draft stock.
Stanford also lost two key de
fensive backs whose eligibility had
run out: fifth-year senior nickel
back Usua Amanam, the defensive
MVP of the 2013 Rose Bowl, and
senior safety Devon Carrington,
Reynolds' primary backup.
The Cardinal does return three
of its starters in the secondary
from last season: rising senior
strong safety Jordan Richards,
rising senior corner Wayne Lyons
and rising junior corner Alex
Carter. But the unit's lack of
proven depth recently prompted
the addition of two offensive play
ers, receiver Kodi Whitfield and
quarterback Dallas Lloyd, to the
position group. Akina will be
tasked with developing those play
ers quickly if Stanford is to main
tain its success in the secondary, a
hallmark of the Mason era and a
historical outlier for a Cardinal
program that has typically domi
nated up front.
