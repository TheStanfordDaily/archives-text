# Student comedians inspire laughter
## 'Stand-up comedy is an art.' 
### IRENE HSU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The format for tonight's show is simple,
says Stu Melton 'l5. The co-president of
Stanford's comedy club Stand Up, D and
tonight's co-host faces a full Roble theater.
The audience is relaxed and ready for laughs.
"I'll start with a joke," he says. "Til contin
ue with some more jokes. And then I'll finish
on a joke."
As lecturer Hilton Obenzinger Ph.D. '97
said, "The first duty of a stand-up comic is to
make people laugh."
Obenzinger teaches the class "Stand-Up
Comedy and the 'Great American Joke' Since
1945" in autumn quarter.
"If you can laugh at something, you're
bringing it close, making it real. You can't be
in awe or afraid of something if you can laugh
at it," he said.
Obenzinger cited comedian Tig Notaros'
visit to Stanford last week. One of the first
jokes she told was about breast cancer.
"People were very conflicted," Obenzinger
said. The joke grew, as did the audience's
comfort, allowing them to laugh along with
Notaro.

But laughter, which makes comedy so suc
cessful, can also be its downfall.

"People don't think that laughter says
something serious about the world," Oben
zinger said. "The idea of saying comedy is an
art art is supposed to be exalted and high,
but comedy is low."
Anthony So 'l4, Stand Up, D's co-presi
dent, has performed stand-up comedy in New
York City and Los Angeles and has three full
years of experience with stand-up comedy. He
and Melton co-host Stand Up, D's weekly
open mics on Fridays at 7 p.m. at the CoHo.
While both recognized that aspiring comics
will not "make [or] break" at open mics, they
also noted that audience reaction level is
more passive.
"Open mics are only half for entertain
ment and half for people to practice this cre
ative endeavor," So said. "And there's a lack of
understanding that comedy is an art. It's a
form of expression."
All the world's a stage
Laughter is spontaneous and yet the
interviewed Stand Up, D comics all empha
sized practice. Complaints from Alex Cheng
'l7, Melton and So revolved around the inabil
ity to practice enough "not enough per
formance space," "only get to practice twice a
