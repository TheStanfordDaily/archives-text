# Student comedians inspire laughter
## 'Stand-up comedy is an art.' 
### IRENE HSU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The format for tonight's show is simple,
says Stu Melton 'l5. The co-president of
Stanford's comedy club Stand Up, D and
tonight's co-host faces a full Roble theater.
The audience is relaxed and ready for laughs.
"I'll start with a joke," he says. "Til contin
ue with some more jokes. And then I'll finish
on a joke."
As lecturer Hilton Obenzinger Ph.D. '97
said, "The first duty of a stand-up comic is to
make people laugh."
Obenzinger teaches the class "Stand-Up
Comedy and the 'Great American Joke' Since
1945" in autumn quarter.
"If you can laugh at something, you're
bringing it close, making it real. You can't be
in awe or afraid of something if you can laugh
at it," he said.
Obenzinger cited comedian Tig Notaros'
visit to Stanford last week. One of the first
jokes she told was about breast cancer.
"People were very conflicted," Obenzinger
said. The joke grew, as did the audience's
comfort, allowing them to laugh along with
Notaro.

But laughter, which makes comedy so suc
cessful, can also be its downfall.

"People don't think that laughter says
something serious about the world," Oben
zinger said. "The idea of saying comedy is an
art art is supposed to be exalted and high,
but comedy is low."
Anthony So 'l4, Stand Up, D's co-presi
dent, has performed stand-up comedy in New
York City and Los Angeles and has three full
years of experience with stand-up comedy. He
and Melton co-host Stand Up, D's weekly
open mics on Fridays at 7 p.m. at the CoHo.
While both recognized that aspiring comics
will not "make [or] break" at open mics, they
also noted that audience reaction level is
more passive.
"Open mics are only half for entertain
ment and half for people to practice this cre
ative endeavor," So said. "And there's a lack of
understanding that comedy is an art. It's a
form of expression."
All the world's a stage

On Saturday, Stanford's comedy club, Stand Up, D, hosted an open mic night in Roble
theater. The event allowed comics around campus to practice through live performance.
week" and advice on be
coming a better comic "be
dedicated," "keep doing it"
revolved around practic
ing enough.
During one of Cheng's
routines, Peter Lindener, al
so known as the Saxophone
Man, told him, "You've done
this joke before."
Lindener was right.
Cheng has done the joke
around 15 times and proba
bly will perform it countless
times to come.

"For me, joke-writing is
not just about being funny,"
said Cheng. "It's more about
repetition, changing it a little
until it works."

It is only through this
repetition that something
akin to a "voice" or a "style"
develops, according to
Melton and So, as the comic
understands what works for
him or her.

Melton describes his style
as deadpan, while So de
scribes his as "controlled
chaos."

When asked about true
personalities of Stand Up,
D's co-presidents, Cheng
confirmed, "It's true. As peo
ple, Stu is very much laid
back, and Anthony is aggres
sive. As comics, they're even
more like that."

So is stand-up comedy
acting, in the sense that the
comic adopts a character on
stage?

"That's right," Oben
zinger said. "The persona
you see on stage is either in
vented, or an exaggeration of
the comics' personality. Ex
cept in stand-up, you make
up the script. You develop en
tire routines based on the
character you bring."

Timing the punch
Comedy is not a sponta
neous combustion of jokes
onstage. There is no way to
quantify the work that builds
up to each show, routine,
joke. The basic structure is
setup, punchline and tagline
but the joke itself takes
form anywhere. It can sprout
from a commercial or a mis
understanding. It can take
root in an eavesdropped con
versation or a disastrous
event. From there, it grows
through a process akin to
creative writing.

Melton has accumulated
eight notebooks from his
stand-up comedy experi
ences over the past two
years. He also carries around
a smaller notebook to jot
down ideas. From there, he
picks out half the ideas to de
velop into jokes, then contin
ues to weed out ones that he
refines and later performs.
On the other hand, Cheng
said that some of his best
writing comes right before
the show.

"Something I learned
from TAPS 103 [Beginning
Improvising] is that the first
thing you think of is usually
the best," he said. "For come
dy, that concept is liberating."
But writing itself is only
part of the process. There
must be a rhythm to the way
the joke is delivered Jerry
Seinfeld once described it as
"songwriting."

"The audience knows
what's coming, but I'm hold
ing the punchline back, hold
ing it back, holding it back
and then I release it," Cheng
said. "If I get it right, the au
dience laughs."

Content and delivery
Getting it right, as it
turns out, is difficult depend
ing on the content.
Obenzinger cited comedians
such as Lenny Bruce and
Dick Gregory who worked
with tricky and controversial
material such as vulgarity,
sex and race.
Both are considered suc
cessful social critics through

their satirical comedy. The
responses to each, however,
differed drastically. A black
comedian, Gregory's first
time using comedy for social
criticism in front of a white
audience won over Hugh
Hefner, who then helped
launch Gregory's success as
a comedian. Bruce, on the
other hand, died before his
charges for obscenity in his
satirical comedy could be
overturned.

While comedy can be a
powerful way to make social
commentary, it walks a fine
line. As it turns out, when
Lindener told Cheng that he
had "already told the joke
before," he was criticizing
Cheng's content, rather than
his repetition.
The joke was controver
sial. It touched on race in a
way that could easily be mis
taken for racism, when in
fact it was meant as satire.
"He seemed interested in
how far he could push the au
dience, like he might be
cloaking hate speech in his
rhetoric. I felt I needed to
speak up," Lindener said.
Far from being unsup
portive, Lindener explained,
"I want to leave him chal
lenged to put his message so
skillfully across that he
proves his intentions are
good."

The comedian walks the
fine line for controversial
content in the delivery of the
joke.
"Comedy is about estab
lishing contact rather than
superiority," Obenzinger
said. "You have to be willing
to make fun of yourself for
the audience to laugh. And
there are two types of laugh
ter— laughing with some
one and laughing at some
one. The artistry of stand-up
comedy is to get those differ
ent moods together."

The audience response
To be fair, Cheng's lack of
success that night may have
been beyond his control.
While a joke may trigger
laughter one night, it can
backfire the next it is up
to the audience, after all, to
share or withdraw laughter.
The time Lindener inter
rupted him, Cheng was the
only comic amid poets and
musicians, catering to a cafe
full of people working on a
Wednesday night.
Weeks later, Cheng again
performed the exact same
routine during last Saturday
night's comedy show. This
time, however, he was per
forming to a theater full of
college students waiting for a
joke. The second audience
easily accepted and laughed
at his jokes, whereas the first
was reluctant to acknowl
edge the humor.
The success of a joke,
then, can only be gauged by
performing in front of many
audiences.

For comics in Stand Up,
D, an audience is only avail
able every so often at CoHo's
open mics. And even then,
the saying "better than noth
ing" doesn't always hold
the audience is generally
passive.
"Comics learn from the
audience," Melton said. "We
listen to what they're laugh
ing to, what they're smiling
at, and that's how we change
our jokes. But if we're not
getting any feedback, this
process doesn't work. The
only thing worse than this is
a hostile audience."

Even benign interaction,
however, such as during No
taro's appearance on cam
pus, can throw off the pace of
the routine. Notaro's show
on March 5 featured unusu
ally heavy audience interac
tion toward the second half
of her routine there was a
noticeable slowdown in pace.

"The audience interac
tion caused a slowdown in
momentum," Melton told me
after the show. "She seemed
to have trouble finding a
good finisher."

If audience interaction
can throw off a seasoned
comic like Notaro, imagine
its effect on amateur comics.

At the same time, per
haps something is better
than nothing. Melton, So and
Obenzinger all acknowledge
the benefit of practicing on
an indifferent audience.
"The audience isn't listen
ing? That's a great place to
practice," Obenzinger said.
"You learn to win their atten
tions. It's not just given to
you."

On their end, whether
through announcements ear
lier in the night to cue the au
dience for comedy or
through music to prepare the
mood, Melton and So have
been trying to "spread
awareness of comedy."
"We make an effort to get
people to come every week
and give us an attentive
crowd where it's easy to
laugh," Melton said.
At a certain point, So and
Melton both agree that no
matter how hard a comic
works, the comic will never
appeal to everyone.
"Comedy is about saying
your own thing and getting
your time to say it —if
somebody doesn't connect
with what you're saying,
then maybe it's just not their
thing," Melton said.

Comedy at Stanford
While open mic reception
on campus can be lackluster,
the University makes up for
it in other ways, according to
Stand Up, D members.
"There's a lot of support
within the faculty that I don't
think you'd be able to find at
a different school," So said.
Though So's academic in
terests range from art studio
practice to computer science,
he said that his studies some
how always take him back to
comedy. For example, his fi
nal art project is a stand-up
comedy album interspersed
with readings of literature
and poetry as an experiment
in different styles of reading
and performing. He has also
animated his routines.
Even Stanford's culture
of research excellence has
impacted the campus come
dy scene. For instance, this
year, through Stanford's
Levinthal Tutorial, So
worked with creative writer
Allison Davis to weave his
routines into a more cohesive
story. He plans to apply for a
grant in order to research
stand-up comedy in San
Francisco this summer.
Melton, too, has done

some research in comedy,
particularly on the reaction
of written comedy such as
puns. This summer, he is ap
plying for a grant through
the University to perform in
New York City.
Even Cheng, who is one
of the more inexperienced
members of Stand Up, D,
said that he hopes to gain ex
perience in comedy this sum
mer through NPR's "Wait
Wait Don't Tell Me!," a ra
dio show whose political bent
he found fitting for him,
among other internships.
"The great thing about
comedy is that you have to
bear the responsibility,"
Cheng said. "If something
goes wrong, there's no one to
throw you a bone it's all
on you. If something goes
right, you know you've been
successful with what you've
worked on."

For Cheng, So, Melton
and Obenzinger, it is that
kind of gumption that ele
vates stand-up comedy into
not just entertainment, but a
form of expression.
"Stand-up comedy is an
art. Anyone who says it isn't
an art is a fool. They don't
know art," Obenzinger said.
He paused, as though de
liberating his sass.
"And you can quote me on
that."

a smaller notebook to jot
down ideas. From there, he
picks out half the ideas to de
velop into jokes, then contin
ues to weed out ones that he
refines and later performs.
On the other hand, Cheng
said that some of his best
writing comes right before
the show.

"Something I learned
from TAPS 103 [Beginning
Improvising] is that the first
thing you think of is usually
the best," he said. "For come
dy, that concept is liberating."
But writing itself is only
part of the process. There
must be a rhythm to the way
the joke is delivered Jerry
Seinfeld once described it as
"songwriting."

"The audience knows
what's coming, but I'm hold
ing the punchline back, hold
ing it back, holding it back
and then I release it," Cheng
said. "If I get it right, the au
dience laughs."

Content and delivery
Getting it right, as it
turns out, is difficult depend
ing on the content.
Obenzinger cited comedians
such as Lenny Bruce and
Dick Gregory who worked
with tricky and controversial
material such as vulgarity,
sex and race.
Both are considered suc
cessful social critics through

their satirical comedy. The
responses to each, however,
differed drastically. A black
comedian, Gregory's first
time using comedy for social
criticism in front of a white
audience won over Hugh
Hefner, who then helped
launch Gregory's success as
a comedian. Bruce, on the
other hand, died before his
charges for obscenity in his
satirical comedy could be
overturned.

While comedy can be a
powerful way to make social
commentary, it walks a fine
line. As it turns out, when
Lindener told Cheng that he
had "already told the joke
before," he was criticizing
Cheng's content, rather than
his repetition.
The joke was controver
sial. It touched on race in a
way that could easily be mis
taken for racism, when in
fact it was meant as satire.
"He seemed interested in
how far he could push the au
dience, like he might be
cloaking hate speech in his
rhetoric. I felt I needed to
speak up," Lindener said.
Far from being unsup
portive, Lindener explained,
"I want to leave him chal
lenged to put his message so
skillfully across that he
proves his intentions are
good."

The comedian walks the
fine line for controversial
content in the delivery of the
joke.
"Comedy is about estab
lishing contact rather than
superiority," Obenzinger
said. "You have to be willing
to make fun of yourself for
the audience to laugh. And
there are two types of laugh
ter— laughing with some
one and laughing at some
one. The artistry of stand-up
comedy is to get those differ
ent moods together."

The audience response
To be fair, Cheng's lack of
success that night may have
been beyond his control.
While a joke may trigger
laughter one night, it can
backfire the next it is up
to the audience, after all, to
share or withdraw laughter.
The time Lindener inter
rupted him, Cheng was the
only comic amid poets and
musicians, catering to a cafe
full of people working on a
Wednesday night.
Weeks later, Cheng again
performed the exact same
routine during last Saturday
night's comedy show. This
time, however, he was per
forming to a theater full of
college students waiting for a
joke. The second audience
easily accepted and laughed
at his jokes, whereas the first
was reluctant to acknowl
edge the humor.
The success of a joke,
then, can only be gauged by
performing in front of many
audiences.

For comics in Stand Up,
D, an audience is only avail
able every so often at CoHo's
open mics. And even then,
the saying "better than noth
ing" doesn't always hold
the audience is generally
passive.
"Comics learn from the
audience," Melton said. "We
listen to what they're laugh
ing to, what they're smiling
at, and that's how we change
our jokes. But if we're not
getting any feedback, this
process doesn't work. The
only thing worse than this is
a hostile audience."

Even benign interaction,
however, such as during No
taro's appearance on cam
pus, can throw off the pace of
the routine. Notaro's show
on March 5 featured unusu
ally heavy audience interac
tion toward the second half
of her routine there was a
noticeable slowdown in pace.

"The audience interac
tion caused a slowdown in
momentum," Melton told me
after the show. "She seemed
to have trouble finding a
good finisher."

If audience interaction
can throw off a seasoned
comic like Notaro, imagine
its effect on amateur comics.

At the same time, per
haps something is better
than nothing. Melton, So and
Obenzinger all acknowledge
the benefit of practicing on
an indifferent audience.
"The audience isn't listen
ing? That's a great place to
practice," Obenzinger said.
"You learn to win their atten
tions. It's not just given to
you."

On their end, whether
through announcements ear
lier in the night to cue the au
dience for comedy or
through music to prepare the
mood, Melton and So have
been trying to "spread
awareness of comedy."
"We make an effort to get
people to come every week
and give us an attentive
crowd where it's easy to
laugh," Melton said.
At a certain point, So and
Melton both agree that no
matter how hard a comic
works, the comic will never
appeal to everyone.
"Comedy is about saying
your own thing and getting
your time to say it —if
somebody doesn't connect
with what you're saying,
then maybe it's just not their
thing," Melton said.

Comedy at Stanford
While open mic reception
on campus can be lackluster,
the University makes up for
it in other ways, according to
Stand Up, D members.
"There's a lot of support
within the faculty that I don't
think you'd be able to find at
a different school," So said.
Though So's academic in
terests range from art studio
practice to computer science,
he said that his studies some
how always take him back to
comedy. For example, his fi
nal art project is a stand-up
comedy album interspersed
with readings of literature
and poetry as an experiment
in different styles of reading
and performing. He has also
animated his routines.
Even Stanford's culture
of research excellence has
impacted the campus come
dy scene. For instance, this
year, through Stanford's
Levinthal Tutorial, So
worked with creative writer
Allison Davis to weave his
routines into a more cohesive
story. He plans to apply for a
grant in order to research
stand-up comedy in San
Francisco this summer.
Melton, too, has done

some research in comedy,
particularly on the reaction
of written comedy such as
puns. This summer, he is ap
plying for a grant through
the University to perform in
New York City.
Even Cheng, who is one
of the more inexperienced
members of Stand Up, D,
said that he hopes to gain ex
perience in comedy this sum
mer through NPR's "Wait
Wait Don't Tell Me!," a ra
dio show whose political bent
he found fitting for him,
among other internships.
"The great thing about
comedy is that you have to
bear the responsibility,"
Cheng said. "If something
goes wrong, there's no one to
throw you a bone it's all
on you. If something goes
right, you know you've been
successful with what you've
worked on."

For Cheng, So, Melton
and Obenzinger, it is that
kind of gumption that ele
vates stand-up comedy into
not just entertainment, but a
form of expression.
"Stand-up comedy is an
art. Anyone who says it isn't
an art is a fool. They don't
know art," Obenzinger said.
He paused, as though de
liberating his sass.
"And you can quote me on
that."

The format for tonight's show is simple,
says Stu Melton 'l5. The co-president of
Stanford's comedy club Stand Up, D and
tonight's co-host faces a full Roble theater.
The audience is relaxed and ready for laughs.
"I'll start with a joke," he says. "Til contin
ue with some more jokes. And then I'll finish
on a joke."
As lecturer Hilton Obenzinger Ph.D. '97
said, "The first duty of a stand-up comic is to
make people laugh."
Obenzinger teaches the class "Stand-Up
Comedy and the 'Great American Joke' Since
1945" in autumn quarter.
"If you can laugh at something, you're
bringing it close, making it real. You can't be
in awe or afraid of something if you can laugh
at it," he said.
Obenzinger cited comedian Tig Notaros'
visit to Stanford last week. One of the first
jokes she told was about breast cancer.
"People were very conflicted," Obenzinger
said. The joke grew, as did the audience's
comfort, allowing them to laugh along with
Notaro.

But laughter, which makes comedy so suc
cessful, can also be its downfall.

"People don't think that laughter says
something serious about the world," Oben
zinger said. "The idea of saying comedy is an
art art is supposed to be exalted and high,
but comedy is low."
Anthony So 'l4, Stand Up, D's co-presi
dent, has performed stand-up comedy in New
York City and Los Angeles and has three full
years of experience with stand-up comedy. He
and Melton co-host Stand Up, D's weekly
open mics on Fridays at 7 p.m. at the CoHo.
While both recognized that aspiring comics
will not "make [or] break" at open mics, they
also noted that audience reaction level is
more passive.
"Open mics are only half for entertain
ment and half for people to practice this cre
ative endeavor," So said. "And there's a lack of
understanding that comedy is an art. It's a
form of expression."
All the world's a stage

On Saturday, Stanford's comedy club, Stand Up, D, hosted an open mic night in Roble
theater. The event allowed comics around campus to practice through live performance.
week" and advice on be
coming a better comic "be
dedicated," "keep doing it"
revolved around practic
ing enough.
During one of Cheng's
routines, Peter Lindener, al
so known as the Saxophone
Man, told him, "You've done
this joke before."
Lindener was right.
Cheng has done the joke
around 15 times and proba
bly will perform it countless
times to come.

"For me, joke-writing is
not just about being funny,"
said Cheng. "It's more about
repetition, changing it a little
until it works."

It is only through this
repetition that something
akin to a "voice" or a "style"
develops, according to
Melton and So, as the comic
understands what works for
him or her.

Melton describes his style
as deadpan, while So de
scribes his as "controlled
chaos."

When asked about true
personalities of Stand Up,
D's co-presidents, Cheng
confirmed, "It's true. As peo
ple, Stu is very much laid
back, and Anthony is aggres
sive. As comics, they're even
more like that."

So is stand-up comedy
acting, in the sense that the
comic adopts a character on
stage?

"That's right," Oben
zinger said. "The persona
you see on stage is either in
vented, or an exaggeration of
the comics' personality. Ex
cept in stand-up, you make
up the script. You develop en
tire routines based on the
character you bring."

Timing the punch
Comedy is not a sponta
neous combustion of jokes
onstage. There is no way to
quantify the work that builds
up to each show, routine,
joke. The basic structure is
setup, punchline and tagline
but the joke itself takes
form anywhere. It can sprout
from a commercial or a mis
understanding. It can take
root in an eavesdropped con
versation or a disastrous
event. From there, it grows
through a process akin to
creative writing.

Melton has accumulated
eight notebooks from his
stand-up comedy experi
ences over the past two
years. He also carries around
a smaller notebook to jot
down ideas. From there, he
picks out half the ideas to de
velop into jokes, then contin
ues to weed out ones that he
refines and later performs.
On the other hand, Cheng
said that some of his best
writing comes right before
the show.

"Something I learned
from TAPS 103 [Beginning
Improvising] is that the first
thing you think of is usually
the best," he said. "For come
dy, that concept is liberating."
But writing itself is only
part of the process. There
must be a rhythm to the way
the joke is delivered Jerry
Seinfeld once described it as
"songwriting."

"The audience knows
what's coming, but I'm hold
ing the punchline back, hold
ing it back, holding it back
and then I release it," Cheng
said. "If I get it right, the au
dience laughs."

Content and delivery
Getting it right, as it
turns out, is difficult depend
ing on the content.
Obenzinger cited comedians
such as Lenny Bruce and
Dick Gregory who worked
with tricky and controversial
material such as vulgarity,
sex and race.
Both are considered suc
cessful social critics through

their satirical comedy. The
responses to each, however,
differed drastically. A black
comedian, Gregory's first
time using comedy for social
criticism in front of a white
audience won over Hugh
Hefner, who then helped
launch Gregory's success as
a comedian. Bruce, on the
other hand, died before his
charges for obscenity in his
satirical comedy could be
overturned.

While comedy can be a
powerful way to make social
commentary, it walks a fine
line. As it turns out, when
Lindener told Cheng that he
had "already told the joke
before," he was criticizing
Cheng's content, rather than
his repetition.
The joke was controver
sial. It touched on race in a
way that could easily be mis
taken for racism, when in
fact it was meant as satire.
"He seemed interested in
how far he could push the au
dience, like he might be

Far from being unsup

"I want to leave him chal

The comedian walks the
fine line for controversial
content in the delivery of the
joke.

can throw off a seasoned
comic like Notaro, imagine
its effect on amateur comics.

At the same time, per
haps something is better
than nothing. Melton, So and
Obenzinger all acknowledge
the benefit of practicing on
an indifferent audience.
"The audience isn't listen
ing? That's a great place to
practice," Obenzinger said.
"You learn to win their atten
tions. It's not just given to
you."

On their end, whether
through announcements ear
lier in the night to cue the au
dience for comedy or
through music to prepare the
mood, Melton and So have
been trying to "spread
awareness of comedy."
"We make an effort to get
people to come every week
and give us an attentive
crowd where it's easy to
laugh," Melton said.
At a certain point, So and
Melton both agree that no
matter how hard a comic
works, the comic will never
appeal to everyone.
"Comedy is about saying
your own thing and getting
your time to say it —if
somebody doesn't connect
with what you're saying,
then maybe it's just not their
thing," Melton said.

Comedy at Stanford
While open mic reception
on campus can be lackluster,
the University makes up for
it in other ways, according to
Stand Up, D members.
"There's a lot of support
within the faculty that I don't
think you'd be able to find at
a different school," So said.
Though So's academic in
terests range from art studio
practice to computer science,
he said that his studies some
how always take him back to
comedy. For example, his fi
nal art project is a stand-up
comedy album interspersed
with readings of literature
and poetry as an experiment
in different styles of reading
and performing. He has also
animated his routines.
Even Stanford's culture
of research excellence has
impacted the campus come
dy scene. For instance, this
year, through Stanford's
Levinthal Tutorial, So
worked with creative writer
Allison Davis to weave his
routines into a more cohesive
story. He plans to apply for a
grant in order to research
stand-up comedy in San
Francisco this summer.
Melton, too, has done

some research in comedy,
particularly on the reaction
of written comedy such as
puns. This summer, he is ap
plying for a grant through
the University to perform in
New York City.
Even Cheng, who is one
of the more inexperienced
members of Stand Up, D,
said that he hopes to gain ex
perience in comedy this sum
mer through NPR's "Wait
Wait Don't Tell Me!," a ra
dio show whose political bent
he found fitting for him,
among other internships.
"The great thing about
comedy is that you have to
bear the responsibility,"
Cheng said. "If something
goes wrong, there's no one to
throw you a bone it's all
on you. If something goes
right, you know you've been
successful with what you've
worked on."

For Cheng, So, Melton
and Obenzinger, it is that
kind of gumption that ele
vates stand-up comedy into
not just entertainment, but a
form of expression.
"Stand-up comedy is an
art. Anyone who says it isn't
an art is a fool. They don't
know art," Obenzinger said.
He paused, as though de
liberating his sass.
"And you can quote me on
that."

The format for tonight's show is simple,
says Stu Melton 'l5. The co-president of
Stanford's comedy club Stand Up, D and
tonight's co-host faces a full Roble theater.
The audience is relaxed and ready for laughs.
"I'll start with a joke," he says. "Til contin
ue with some more jokes. And then I'll finish
on a joke."
As lecturer Hilton Obenzinger Ph.D. '97
said, "The first duty of a stand-up comic is to
make people laugh."
Obenzinger teaches the class "Stand-Up
Comedy and the 'Great American Joke' Since
1945" in autumn quarter.
"If you can laugh at something, you're
bringing it close, making it real. You can't be
in awe or afraid of something if you can laugh
at it," he said.
Obenzinger cited comedian Tig Notaros'
visit to Stanford last week. One of the first
jokes she told was about breast cancer.
"People were very conflicted," Obenzinger
said. The joke grew, as did the audience's
comfort, allowing them to laugh along with
Notaro.

But laughter, which makes comedy so suc
cessful, can also be its downfall.

"People don't think that laughter says
something serious about the world," Oben
zinger said. "The idea of saying comedy is an
art art is supposed to be exalted and high,
but comedy is low."
Anthony So 'l4, Stand Up, D's co-presi
dent, has performed stand-up comedy in New
York City and Los Angeles and has three full
years of experience with stand-up comedy. He
and Melton co-host Stand Up, D's weekly
open mics on Fridays at 7 p.m. at the CoHo.
While both recognized that aspiring comics
will not "make [or] break" at open mics, they
also noted that audience reaction level is
more passive.
"Open mics are only half for entertain
ment and half for people to practice this cre
ative endeavor," So said. "And there's a lack of
understanding that comedy is an art. It's a
form of expression."
All the world's a stage

On Saturday, Stanford's comedy club, Stand Up, D, hosted an open mic night in Roble
theater. The event allowed comics around campus to practice through live performance.
week" and advice on be
coming a better comic "be
dedicated," "keep doing it"
revolved around practic
ing enough.
During one of Cheng's
routines, Peter Lindener, al
so known as the Saxophone
Man, told him, "You've done
this joke before."
Lindener was right.
Cheng has done the joke
around 15 times and proba
bly will perform it countless
times to come.

"For me, joke-writing is
not just about being funny,"
said Cheng. "It's more about
repetition, changing it a little
until it works."

It is only through this
repetition that something
akin to a "voice" or a "style"
develops, according to
Melton and So, as the comic
understands what works for
him or her.

Melton describes his style
as deadpan, while So de
scribes his as "controlled
chaos."

When asked about true
personalities of Stand Up,
D's co-presidents, Cheng
confirmed, "It's true. As peo
ple, Stu is very much laid
back, and Anthony is aggres
sive. As comics, they're even
more like that."

So is stand-up comedy
acting, in the sense that the
comic adopts a character on
stage?

"That's right," Oben
zinger said. "The persona
you see on stage is either in
vented, or an exaggeration of
the comics' personality. Ex
cept in stand-up, you make
up the script. You develop en
tire routines based on the
character you bring."

Timing the punch
Comedy is not a sponta
neous combustion of jokes
onstage. There is no way to
quantify the work that builds
up to each show, routine,
joke. The basic structure is
setup, punchline and tagline
but the joke itself takes
form anywhere. It can sprout
from a commercial or a mis
understanding. It can take
root in an eavesdropped con
versation or a disastrous
event. From there, it grows
through a process akin to
creative writing.

Melton has accumulated
eight notebooks from his
stand-up comedy experi
ences over the past two
years. He also carries around
a smaller notebook to jot
down ideas. From there, he
picks out half the ideas to de
velop into jokes, then contin
ues to weed out ones that he
refines and later performs.
On the other hand, Cheng
said that some of his best
writing comes right before
the show.

"Something I learned
from TAPS 103 [Beginning
Improvising] is that the first
thing you think of is usually
the best," he said. "For come
dy, that concept is liberating."
But writing itself is only
part of the process. There
must be a rhythm to the way
the joke is delivered Jerry
Seinfeld once described it as
"songwriting."

"The audience knows
what's coming, but I'm hold
ing the punchline back, hold
ing it back, holding it back
and then I release it," Cheng
said. "If I get it right, the au
dience laughs."

Content and delivery
Getting it right, as it
turns out, is difficult depend
ing on the content.
Obenzinger cited comedians
such as Lenny Bruce and
Dick Gregory who worked
with tricky and controversial
material such as vulgarity,
sex and race.
Both are considered suc
cessful social critics through

their satirical comedy. The
responses to each, however,
differed drastically. A black
comedian, Gregory's first
time using comedy for social
criticism in front of a white
audience won over Hugh
Hefner, who then helped
launch Gregory's success as
a comedian. Bruce, on the
other hand, died before his
charges for obscenity in his
satirical comedy could be
overturned.

While comedy can be a
powerful way to make social
commentary, it walks a fine
line. As it turns out, when
Lindener told Cheng that he
had "already told the joke
before," he was criticizing
Cheng's content, rather than
his repetition.
The joke was controver
sial. It touched on race in a
way that could easily be mis
taken for racism, when in
fact it was meant as satire.
"He seemed interested in
how far he could push the au
dience, like he might be
cloaking hate speech in his
rhetoric. I felt I needed to
speak up," Lindener said.
Far from being unsup
portive, Lindener explained,
"I want to leave him chal
lenged to put his message so
skillfully across that he
proves his intentions are
good."

The comedian walks the
fine line for controversial
content in the delivery of the
joke.
"Comedy is about estab
lishing contact rather than
superiority," Obenzinger
said. "You have to be willing
to make fun of yourself for
the audience to laugh. And
there are two types of laugh
ter— laughing with some
one and laughing at some
one. The artistry of stand-up
comedy is to get those differ
ent moods together."

The audience response
To be fair, Cheng's lack of
success that night may have
been beyond his control.
While a joke may trigger
laughter one night, it can
backfire the next it is up
to the audience, after all, to
share or withdraw laughter.
The time Lindener inter
rupted him, Cheng was the
only comic amid poets and
musicians, catering to a cafe
full of people working on a
Wednesday night.
Weeks later, Cheng again
performed the exact same
routine during last Saturday
night's comedy show. This
time, however, he was per
forming to a theater full of
college students waiting for a
joke. The second audience
easily accepted and laughed
at his jokes, whereas the first
was reluctant to acknowl
edge the humor.
The success of a joke,
then, can only be gauged by
performing in front of many
audiences.

For comics in Stand Up,
D, an audience is only avail
able every so often at CoHo's
open mics. And even then,
the saying "better than noth
ing" doesn't always hold
the audience is generally
passive.
"Comics learn from the
audience," Melton said. "We
listen to what they're laugh
ing to, what they're smiling
at, and that's how we change
our jokes. But if we're not
getting any feedback, this
process doesn't work. The
only thing worse than this is
a hostile audience."

Even benign interaction,
however, such as during No
taro's appearance on cam
pus, can throw off the pace of
the routine. Notaro's show
on March 5 featured unusu
ally heavy audience interac
tion toward the second half
of her routine there was a
noticeable slowdown in pace.

"The audience interac
tion caused a slowdown in
momentum," Melton told me
after the show. "She seemed
to have trouble finding a
good finisher."

If audience interaction
can throw off a seasoned
comic like Notaro, imagine
its effect on amateur comics.

At the same time, per
haps something is better
than nothing. Melton, So and
Obenzinger all acknowledge
the benefit of practicing on
an indifferent audience.
"The audience isn't listen

something serious about the world," Oben
zinger said. "The idea of saying comedy is an
art art is supposed to be exalted and high,
but comedy is low."
Anthony So 'l4, Stand Up, D's co-presi
dent, has performed stand-up comedy in New
York City and Los Angeles and has three full
years of experience with stand-up comedy. He
and Melton co-host Stand Up, D's weekly
open mics on Fridays at 7 p.m. at the CoHo.
While both recognized that aspiring comics
will not "make [or] break" at open mics, they
also noted that audience reaction level is
more passive.
"Open mics are only half for entertain
ment and half for people to practice this cre
ative endeavor," So said. "And there's a lack of
understanding that comedy is an art. It's a
form of expression."
All the world's a stage

On Saturday, Stanford's comedy club, Stand Up, D, hosted an open mic night in Roble
theater. The event allowed comics around campus to practice through live performance.
week" and advice on be
coming a better comic "be
dedicated," "keep doing it"
revolved around practic
ing enough.
During one of Cheng's
routines, Peter Lindener, al
so known as the Saxophone
Man, told him, "You've done
this joke before."
Lindener was right.
Cheng has done the joke
around 15 times and proba
bly will perform it countless
times to come.

"For me, joke-writing is
not just about being funny,"
said Cheng. "It's more about
repetition, changing it a little
until it works."

It is only through this
repetition that something
akin to a "voice" or a "style"
develops, according to
Melton and So, as the comic
understands what works for
him or her.

Melton describes his style
as deadpan, while So de
scribes his as "controlled
chaos."

When asked about true
personalities of Stand Up,
D's co-presidents, Cheng
confirmed, "It's true. As peo
ple, Stu is very much laid
back, and Anthony is aggres
sive. As comics, they're even
more like that."

So is stand-up comedy
acting, in the sense that the
comic adopts a character on
stage?

"That's right," Oben
zinger said. "The persona
you see on stage is either in
vented, or an exaggeration of
the comics' personality. Ex
cept in stand-up, you make
up the script. You develop en
tire routines based on the
character you bring."

Timing the punch
Comedy is not a sponta
neous combustion of jokes
onstage. There is no way to
quantify the work that builds
up to each show, routine,
joke. The basic structure is
setup, punchline and tagline
but the joke itself takes
form anywhere. It can sprout
from a commercial or a mis
understanding. It can take
root in an eavesdropped con
versation or a disastrous
event. From there, it grows
through a process akin to
creative writing.

Melton has accumulated
eight notebooks from his
stand-up comedy experi
ences over the past two
years. He also carries around
a smaller notebook to jot
down ideas. From there, he
picks out half the ideas to de
velop into jokes, then contin
ues to weed out ones that he
refines and later performs.
On the other hand, Cheng
said that some of his best
writing comes right before
the show.

"Something I learned
from TAPS 103 [Beginning
Improvising] is that the first
thing you think of is usually
the best," he said. "For come
dy, that concept is liberating."
But writing itself is only
part of the process. There
must be a rhythm to the way
the joke is delivered Jerry
Seinfeld once described it as
"songwriting."

"The audience knows
what's coming, but I'm hold
ing the punchline back, hold
ing it back, holding it back
and then I release it," Cheng
said. "If I get it right, the au
dience laughs."

Content and delivery
Getting it right, as it
turns out, is difficult depend
ing on the content.
Obenzinger cited comedians
such as Lenny Bruce and
Dick Gregory who worked
with tricky and controversial
material such as vulgarity,
sex and race.
Both are considered suc
cessful social critics through

their satirical comedy. The
responses to each, however,
differed drastically. A black
comedian, Gregory's first
time using comedy for social
criticism in front of a white
audience won over Hugh
Hefner, who then helped
launch Gregory's success as
a comedian. Bruce, on the
other hand, died before his
charges for obscenity in his
satirical comedy could be
overturned.

While comedy can be a
powerful way to make social
commentary, it walks a fine
line. As it turns out, when
Lindener told Cheng that he
had "already told the joke
before," he was criticizing
Cheng's content, rather than
his repetition.
The joke was controver
sial. It touched on race in a
way that could easily be mis
taken for racism, when in
fact it was meant as satire.
"He seemed interested in
how far he could push the au
dience, like he might be
cloaking hate speech in his
rhetoric. I felt I needed to
speak up," Lindener said.
Far from being unsup
portive, Lindener explained,
"I want to leave him chal
lenged to put his message so
skillfully across that he
proves his intentions are
good."

The comedian walks the
fine line for controversial
content in the delivery of the
joke.
"Comedy is about estab
lishing contact rather than
superiority," Obenzinger
said. "You have to be willing
to make fun of yourself for
the audience to laugh. And
there are two types of laugh
ter— laughing with some
one and laughing at some
one. The artistry of stand-up
comedy is to get those differ
ent moods together."

The audience response
To be fair, Cheng's lack of
success that night may have
been beyond his control.
While a joke may trigger
laughter one night, it can
backfire the next it is up
to the audience, after all, to
share or withdraw laughter.
The time Lindener inter
rupted him, Cheng was the
only comic amid poets and
musicians, catering to a cafe
full of people working on a
Wednesday night.
Weeks later, Cheng again
performed the exact same
routine during last Saturday
night's comedy show. This
time, however, he was per
forming to a theater full of
college students waiting for a
joke. The second audience
easily accepted and laughed
at his jokes, whereas the first
was reluctant to acknowl
edge the humor.
The success of a joke,
then, can only be gauged by
performing in front of many
audiences.

For comics in Stand Up,
D, an audience is only avail
able every so often at CoHo's
open mics. And even then,
the saying "better than noth
ing" doesn't always hold
the audience is generally
passive.
"Comics learn from the
audience," Melton said. "We
listen to what they're laugh
ing to, what they're smiling
at, and that's how we change
our jokes. But if we're not
getting any feedback, this
process doesn't work. The
only thing worse than this is
a hostile audience."

Even benign interaction,
however, such as during No
taro's appearance on cam
pus, can throw off the pace of
the routine. Notaro's show
on March 5 featured unusu
ally heavy audience interac
tion toward the second half
of her routine there was a
noticeable slowdown in pace.

"The audience interac
tion caused a slowdown in
momentum," Melton told me
after the show. "She seemed
to have trouble finding a
good finisher."

If audience interaction
can throw off a seasoned
comic like Notaro, imagine
its effect on amateur comics.

At the same time, per
haps something is better
than nothing. Melton, So and
Obenzinger all acknowledge
the benefit of practicing on
an indifferent audience.
"The audience isn't listen
ing? That's a great place to
practice," Obenzinger said.
"You learn to win their atten
tions. It's not just given to
you."

On their end, whether
through announcements ear
lier in the night to cue the au
dience for comedy or
through music to prepare the
mood, Melton and So have
been trying to "spread
awareness of comedy."
"We make an effort to get
people to come every week
and give us an attentive
crowd where it's easy to
laugh," Melton said.
At a certain point, So and
Melton both agree that no
matter how hard a comic
works, the comic will never
appeal to everyone.
"Comedy is about saying
your own thing and getting
your time to say it —if
somebody doesn't connect
with what you're saying,
then maybe it's just not their
thing," Melton said.

Comedy at Stanford
While open mic reception
on campus can be lackluster,
the University makes up for
it in other ways, according to
Stand Up, D members.
"There's a lot of support
within the faculty that I don't
think you'd be able to find at
a different school," So said.
Though So's academic in
terests range from art studio
practice to computer science,
he said that his studies some
how always take him back to
comedy. For example, his fi
nal art project is a stand-up
comedy album interspersed
with readings of literature
and poetry as an experiment
in different styles of reading
and performing. He has also
animated his routines.
Even Stanford's culture
of research excellence has
impacted the campus come
dy scene. For instance, this
year, through Stanford's
Levinthal Tutorial, So
worked with creative writer
Allison Davis to weave his
routines into a more cohesive
story. He plans to apply for a
grant in order to research
stand-up comedy in San
Francisco this summer.
Melton, too, has done

some research in comedy,
particularly on the reaction
of written comedy such as
puns. This summer, he is ap
plying for a grant through
the University to perform in
New York City.
Even Cheng, who is one
of the more inexperienced
members of Stand Up, D,
said that he hopes to gain ex
perience in comedy this sum
mer through NPR's "Wait
Wait Don't Tell Me!," a ra
dio show whose political bent
he found fitting for him,
among other internships.
"The great thing about
comedy is that you have to
bear the responsibility,"
Cheng said. "If something
goes wrong, there's no one to
throw you a bone it's all
on you. If something goes
right, you know you've been
successful with what you've
worked on."

For Cheng, So, Melton
and Obenzinger, it is that
kind of gumption that ele
vates stand-up comedy into
not just entertainment, but a
form of expression.
"Stand-up comedy is an
art. Anyone who says it isn't
an art is a fool. They don't
know art," Obenzinger said.
He paused, as though de
liberating his sass.
"And you can quote me on
that."
