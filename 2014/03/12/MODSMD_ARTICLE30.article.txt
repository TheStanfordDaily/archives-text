# HIGH ALTITUDE CHALLENGE
## Track and field heads to New Mexico for NCAAs 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
Although the outdoor season is
about to get into full swing for
Stanford track and field, one big
hurdle â€”no pun intended re
mains for some Cardinal athletes
in their indoor season: the NCAA
Indoor Championships.
One of the biggest events that
both the Cardinal men and women
will be looking ahead to is the dis
tance medley relay, in which Stan
ford will field two teams that
should both have significant
chances at winning. The men will
field senior Marco Bertolotti on
the 1,200-meter leg to open the
event, before handing off to soph
omore Steven Solomon for the
400, junior Luke Lefebure for the
800 and senior Michael Atchoo for
the 1,600-meter anchor leg.

Stanford's success in that
event will likely fall largely on the
shoulders of Lefebure on the 800-
meter leg, as his ability to main
tain the pace after the 400-meter
sprint will be critical to give
Atchoo, who is capable of running
the mile in under four minutes, a
chance at sealing a victory.
Solomon, who will hand off to
Lefebure, was a finalist in the 400
meters at the 2012 London
Olympics and qualified for the in
dividual 400-meter event, but
withdrew from the open race in
order to focus on the relay. Like
wise, Lefebure also qualified as an
individual for the 800-meter event
but chose to withdraw and devote
his attention to the relay.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal

women will be favorites heading
into their distance medley relay as
they move into the event with a
world-best time of 10:54.04 this
season. The quartet of sophomore
Amy Weissenbach in the 1,200,
sophomore Kristyn Williams in the
400, sophomore Claudia Saunders
in the 800 and fifth-year senior
Justine Fedronic in the 1,600 have
all experienced success this season
that put them into Stanford's
record books, and there is no rea
son to expect them to falter on the
biggest stage of the indoor season.
Even though the trio of Weis
senbach, Saunders and Fedronic
all broke Stanford's previous in
door record in the 800 this season
none are ranked lower than
11th nationally in current times in
the event they all chose to drop
the event to focus on the relay.
With both the men and women de
termined to bring home titles in
this race, look for this to be the
Cardinal's best shot at a national
indoor title.

In the individual races, senior
Erik Olson will be running both
the 5,000-meter race on Friday
night and the 3,000-meter race on
Saturday night, with just under 24
hours to rest in between. Because
of this, he will likely not be quite as
fresh heading into the 3,000, in
which he currently holds the na
tion's fourth-fastest time. That will
just serve as a hindrance to Ol
son's attempt to unseat Arizona's
Lawi Lalang in the event, who is
the reigning NCAA champion and
the holder of the NCAA's fastest
time this season. Olson will be the
first Stanford runner to attempt
both events at the NCAA Indoors
since Chris Derrick 'l2 did so at
the 2012 meet, in which Derrick
finished in second in both events.

Meanwhile, junior Joe Rosa
will also be competing in the 5,000

Senior distance runner Erik Olson (above) is one of eight athletes slated
to run the tough 3000/5000 meter double at the 2014 NCAA
Indoor Track and Field Championships in Albuquerque, N.M.
after qualifying with his second
place finish behind Lalang at the
MPSF Indoor Championships
earlier this month. Rosa will com
pete after having recovered effec
tively from an early-season shin
injury that sidelined him for sev
eral weeks. With both Rosa and
Olson running the 5,000, Stanford
will be one of just five schools with
multiple entrants in the 16-man
field.

On the women's side, junior
Aisling Cuffe and fifth-year senior
Kathy Kroeger will have yet an
other opportunity to cement their
legacies as some of the best fe
male distance runners in the his
tory of the school. Both Cuffe, a
four-time Ail-American, and
Kroeger, a nine-time All-Ameri
can, will be running both the 3,000
and the 5,000, making Stanford
the only school in the competition
with multiple entrants in both of
those events. Both runners own
current top-15 times in the nation
in both events but will be hard
pressed to defeat Dartmouth sen
ior Abbey D'Agostino, who is the
reigning NCAA Indoor champion
in each race and owns the top
times in the nation again this year.
Last season, Cuffe placed 14th
in the 3,000 at the NCAA Indoors
to earn second-team All-America
honors and will look to improve
upon that this year after she bat
tled back from an injury early this
winter. Meanwhile, Kroeger will
look to build on her sixth-place
finish in the 3,000 and her 10th
place finish in the 5,000 during the
2012 NCAA Indoor Champi
onships to end her collegiate indoor
career.

The NCAA Indoor Champi
onships will take place on Friday
and Saturday in Albuquerque, N.M.
