# WALKING OFF IN STYLE
## 
### DAVID COHN STAFF WRITER 
With her team in need of a run
to stave off an upset bid from UC-
Davis, Erin Ashby stepped up to
the plate and with one swing of the
bat, propelled No. 22 Stanford soft
ball to a resilient 3-2 victory over
the Aggies, while helping the Card
finish with a 5-1 record in the Stan
ford Louisville Slugger Classic.
Ashby's walk-off triple down the
right field line provided an exhila
rating finish for the near sellout
crowd on Youth Softball Day at
Smith Family Stadium, as the jun
ior blasted a lacing shot that pow
ered past diving Aggie right fielder
Alicia Paine, allowing junior Cas
sandra Roulund to come all the way
around from first base to score the
winning run. In the process, Ashby
capped off one of the finest week
end performances at home in re
cent memory with the most memo
rable hit of her career on the Farm.

"It was a feeling of getting the
job done when it needed to be done,
and having a timely hit, while
knowing that your teammates have
your back, that you can [provide] a
clutch hit for them as well," Ashby
said.

While Ashby may have saved
her biggest heroics for Sunday
against UC-Davis, she was ex
tremely productive at the plate
throughout the entire four-day
tournament. Ashby opened the
classic on Thursday night by draw
ing two walks, scoring a run and go
ing l-for-2 at the plate in the Cardi
nal's 5-3 win over the BYU
Cougars. Subsequently, she had 2
RBIs and 2 runs scored against
Portland State as part of the Card's
10-0 mercy-rule victory over the
Vikings in the first half of a Friday
doubleheader.

After driving home two more
runs with a double in the fourth and
single in the fifth in a Saturday af
ternoon re-match with the Vikings,
Ashby saved her best for last on
Sunday afternoon against the Ag
gies. Prior to her game-winning
triple, Ashby also notched her fifth
double of the season in the bottom
of the fourth inning. In total, Ashby
finished the classic with a .529 bat
ting average, a .619 on-base per
centage, a .765 slugging percentage
and the team leader in total bases
with 13, while tying with sopho
more Kayla Bonstrom for the high
mark in RBIs with six.

Ashby certainly was not the on
ly player to provide a standout per
formance, as Bonstrom also had an
outstanding weekend for the Cardi
nal. Bonstrom's best showing came
on Saturday afternoon in the
Card's second meeting with Port
land State; Bonstrom batted a per
fect 3-for-3 with 3 RBIs and 2 runs
scored, while helping to lift Stan
ford to a 9-1 rout of PSU.
The 2013 Pac-12 Newcomer of
the Year began her day against the
Vikings with an RBI single in the
first inning that plated Kylie Soren
son and gave the Cardinal a 1-0
lead. After three scoreless innings
between the two teams, Bonstrom
again drove home Sorenson to ex
tend the Card's lead to 2-0, as she
teed off on the first delivery from
Portland State starter Karyn
Wright. Finally, Bonstrom helped
catalyze a five-run outburst in the
bottom of the fifth inning that end
ed the game, giving Stanford its
second run-rule victory over Port
land State. Bonstrom drove home

the first of the five runs scored in
the fifth when she launched a single
down the left field line off of reliev
er Melissa Masters.

"I have been trying to keep it
simple," Bonstrom said. "I have
been working through a few things,
but it is really nice when the rest of

your team really is hot with their
bats... None of us have been feeling
the pressure since all of us have
been hitting so well."
In the circle, Madi Sehreyer re
ceived some support this weekend,
as fellow freshman Kylie Sorenson
and junior Tyiyn Wells both helped

lessen her innings burden. Soren
son picked up her first two career
victories in the circle in her short
time on the Farm; she started in
three out of the six games at the
Louisville Slugger Classic, notch
ing her wins in the two matchups
against Portland State, while pitch-

ing six solid innings on Sunday in a
no-decision against Davis.
Instead, Wells would pick up the
victory in the circle against the Ag
gies, as she was able to work the
Cardinal out off a one-out jam in
the top of the seventh inning by
forcing UC-Davis to strand a run
ner at third base with an induced
groundout and pop out to end the
threat.

For the weekend, Sorenson fin
ished with an outstanding 0.88
ERA, while Wells scattered a single

hit in two innings of scoreless work.
Their efforts complemented anoth
er strong series of starts by
Schreyer, who notched a 2-1 record
this weekend, picking up wins in 5-
3 and 7-5 decisions over BYU. How
ever, she suffered a loss against
North Dakota State when the Stan
ford lineup failed to capitalize with
several runners in scoring position;
in turn, the Bison were able to
shock the Cardinal by handing
them their first home loss by a
score of 4-0.

After the conclusion of Sunday's
game against Davis with Ashby's
walk-off triple, the entire Stanford
softball team welcomed hundreds
of Little Leaguers onto the field for
photos and autographs as part of
Youth Softball Day.
"It keeps things in perspective
for you," Ashby said. "It reminds
you of where you came from, and
reminds you of the little girl who
could only dream of being at this
school and playing in the Pac-12. It
brings things home for you and
makes you realize how much you
love the game."

With finals and a weekend se
ries against Cal looming for the
Cardinal, head coach John Rittman
will try to help his players succeed
on both fronts this week with a fo
cused approach for taking on Dead
Week.

"The bottom line is you have to
manage your time wisely, and being
student-athletes means that you
have to take your schoolwork seri
ously and balance that with the
practice in getting ready for a big
weekend," Rittman said. "We have
to make sure as coaches that we
give them time to study and do the
things to prep [for exams], but also
know that we have conference
games, which are [also] important."
