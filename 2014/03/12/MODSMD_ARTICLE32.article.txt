## INSIDE BAD WORDS 
### ALICIA HAMAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
M M II rrested Development" star
II Jason Bateman made his di
-11 rectorial debut late last
with "Bad Words", a
comedy that has a deeper
â–  Magenda than meets the eye.
The Daily sat down with Bateman in a
roundtable setting to talk about his expe
riences as the film's director and star.

In a departure from the straight
laced family man he played on "Arrested

Development," "Bad Words" sees Bate
man play 40-year-old Guy Trilby, a high
school dropout who finds a loophole
that allows him to enter The Golden
Quill Spelling Bee. Even as he steam
rolls over a succession of eighth graders,
Trilby's companion Jenny (Kathryn
Hahn) attempts to figure out his true
motivations behind his attempts at steal
ing the show.
Throughout "Bad Words," Trilby
comes off as a misanthrope who has no
filter when it comes to speaking his
mind. Bateman explained this was one

of the reasons that drew him to the film.
"It was a challenge, this film," he
said. "There's somebody [Guy Trilby] so
unlikeable... but if it's shot the right
way, or performed the right way, or
scored the right way... all of these
things have to be done in fairly proper
execution in order to make it palatable
to offset the cynicism of this character."
Trilby ends up befriending one of the
contestants, 10-year-old Chaitanya
Chopra (Rohan Chand) on the plane to
the national spelling bee. A flurry of racist
remarks ensues, which does nothing to
dampen Chaitanya's cheerful personality
and persistence to befriend Trilby.
"We do some things that are a little
uncomfortable in this film for certain
people and I found peace with it be
cause this guy is not as smart as you or
me," Bateman said. "He just doesn't
know any better. By the end of the film,
he's a little smarter, but I enjoy going to
films to see a character make a bit of
progression, or transformation."

Bateman said he set out to "let the
audience know that there is a deeper
agenda at play here. There's something
going on that is not as sophomoric as the
premise for the trailer or commercial that
I knew was coming would indicate."
"Bad Words" certainly features a
number of startling moments. One se
quence in particular involves Trilby tak
ing the 10-year-old Chaitanya on a wild
ride at night that culminates in a series
of pranks and experiences that definite
ly come close to the line. In fact, when
Bateman first sat down for this inter
view, he immediately asked if he had to
apologize to anyone for the film. Every
one at the table broke out into laughter.
Ultimately, Bateman argued that "if
you can communicate some humanity
or some vulnerability, regardless of
whether the character is a murderer or
shit disturber like this guy, then people
can come in and enjoy what's going on
inside that environment. You try to find
away to make him human and flawed
and relatable."

"Bad Words" ends up showing that a
misunderstood, foul-mouthed cynic can
indeed grow on you, as Bateman suc
cessfully adds a touch of charm and
charisma that rids the viewer of any af
tertaste that might remain from the out
rageous nature of the film.
