## YBCA showcases architecture, film 
### MARY CAROLE OVERHOLT DESK EDITOR 
This year, from Feb. 27 to
March 30, the Yerba Bue
na Center for the Arts will
host a showcase of nine
design and architecture
films. While their topics
range from exploring the hidden
waterways of cities all over the
world to in depth studies of ar
chitects like Tadao Ando and
Frank Lloyd Wright, The Daily
took a more detailed look at two
of the showcase's most exciting
films.

"16 Acres"
Shot from a bird's eye view of downtown Manhattan,
the opening scene of "16 Acres" reveals what defines New
York City: its skyline. With the attack on the Twin Towers
on September 11, 2001, this skyline was irreparably al
tered, as was the city of New York itself. In his documen
tary "16 Acres," director Richard Hankin chronicles the
complex process of building on Ground Zero.
The film focuses on the five major parties involved in
the reconstruction: powerful land developer Larry Silver
stein, New York Governor George Pataki, the New York and
New Jersey Port Authority, architects Daniel Libeskind and

David Childs, and 9/11 family member Rosaleen Tallon.
The movie's strength lies in its ability to reject the
tempting cliched and gushy story about how different
groups of New Yorkers seamlessly worked together to hon
or the lives lost on 9/11. It is an honest account of discord,
frustration, and concessions made to successfully create a
memorial and new buildings worthy of the site.
The film, and its unbiased approach of interviewing
leaders of opposing parties, makes us realize that there was
no clear answer to the question of who should control
Ground Zero. Now, Ground Zero is no longer an empty,
desolate plot. Instead, it is a place for Americans to interact
and commemorate the lives lost on September 11th, 2001.

"Sagrada: The Mystery of Creation"
If New Yorkers grew impatient with only ten years of
construction, then the Spanish must be the most patient
people in the world. Started 130 years ago, Antonio
Gaudi's La Sagrada Familia is still a work in progress today.
Dominated by footage of scaffolding and the active con
struction of the church, director Stefan Haupt's film reveals
the constantly changing state of this massive architectural
project. The film also details Gaudi's career before La
Sagrada Familia, as well as his Catalan heritage and the nat-
