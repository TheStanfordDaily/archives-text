# STUDENT LIFE
## Kink club not offered recognition Kardinal Kink's application rejected by University 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Kardinal Kink meets in an un
marked room in Kimball Hall. The
group, which recently had its peti
tion to become recognized as a stu
dent group by the University re
jected by Student Activities and
Leadership (SAL), serves as a sup
port and advocacy group for the
kink community at Stanford and
draws anywhere from eight to 30 at
tendees at their meetings.

"Part of the reason we come to
this environment is for the affirma
tion that there are other people who
experience the quote-unquote
"weird" things we do," said Fore
man 'l3, one of the members who
was comfortable talking to a re
porter using a pseudonym. "Identi
fying as 'kink' tends to over-sexual
ize you, which isn't always the case."
Kink is a broad term encompass
ing any non-traditional sexual activ
ity. Bondage, sadism and
masochism, fetishism the range
of kinky activities is as diverse as
the people who enjoy them. What
unites the members of Kardinal
Kink, however, is the desire to
break the silence and engage in
meaningful discussion about these
issues on Stanford campus.
The group has faced obstacles to
attaining those objectives. SALs re
jection of their petition to become a
voluntary student organization
(VSO) prompted one member of the
group to tell Salon.com that the
University was discriminating
against them "for the same reasons
LGBT-type groups were getting re
jected a few decades ago."
Nanci Howe, the director of Stu
dent Activities and Leadership, de
clined to give an interview to The
Daily for this story. The members of
Kardinal Kink were equally hesi
tant to speak about the process, de
clining to give details regarding the
delay. Several of them did express
reservations about comparing
themselves to the LGBT com
munity, which they said had
historically experienced
harsher forms of discrimina
tion than the kink community.
Despite this setback,
members of Kardinal Kink
have worked with the Sexual
Health and Peer Resource
Center (SHPRC) to host sev
eral events on kink-related
topics, including a well-at
tended event on polyamorous
relationships. The group also
regularly brings in experts
from the community to edu
cate members about kink-re
lated topics, including rope
tying, erotic hypnosis and
dominant/submissive rela
tionships.
Members of the group
are quick to stress that these
meetings are not overtly sex
ual, and that no sex or nudity
occurs during any presenta
tions or during group meet
ings. The group seeks to in
form, teach, support and
unite members of the kink
community, not to provide a
space for sexual activity.
Becoming a member of
Kardinal Kink is not as easy
as signing up on their web
site. One member of the
group, a sophomore who
goes by the pseudonym
Nothing, said that often
times new members of the
group come in with unrealis
tic expectations of what the
kink community is.

"Often when it comes to

Kink, you just interact with
things online," she said. "The
result is you never really
hear about kink in a serious,
realistic conversation."

When a person wishes to
join the group, they must
first meet face-to-face with
at least one member of Kar
dinal Kink and confirm they
understand the basic rules of
the group.

"You need more than a
basic understanding of the
meaning of 'no,'" Foreman
said, stressing the impor
tance of active consent in the
kink community. "The em
phasis here tends to be on
'yes means yes.'"
Lily Zheng 'l7 is one of
the few members willing to
cast off anonymity, and
would have become the offi
cial president of the organi
zation had they received
University approval. The
freshman said that she rel
ishes her role as a public
face of the Stanford kink
community.
"A really good thing about
being out is that by defying
perceptions, I get to change
those perceptions," she said.
"If I don't treat it as some
thing different or scary or
exotic, then people are more
willing to talk about it."
Zheng acknowledged that
being open about her kinki
ness may prevent her from
running for office or hurt her
in applying for some jobs.
She framed those draw
backs, however, as a worth
while sacrifice, saying that
she asked herself "Do I want
to get into a position to
change society which

means not being out or do
I want to do a more grass
roots [style] of organizing?"
Zheng said that she has
been able to reach new audi
ences of Stanford students
through the latter option.

"You can talk to a lot of
different people and advo
cate for kink conversa
tions you usually aren't able
to have without outing your
self," she said.
The fate of the group is
still unknown, pending a new
application and review by
SAL. Harvard approved
Harvard Munch, a similar
student group centered on
kink-related education and
discussion, in November of
2012. Columbia, Yale, MIT,
Tufts and University of
Chicago have also approved
similar groups. If they gain
official approval, Kardinal
Kink will be able to formally
host external speakers, re
cruit new members openly,
flyer and receive funding
from student fees.

Regardless of the out
come of their petition, how
ever, the group has already
made waves and provided a
space for kink-minded indi
viduals to meet, talk and ed
ucate themselves. Doing so
without University ap
proval fits in with the
group's larger mission to
change perceptions, accord
ing to members.
"You can't change the so
cial norms if you are busy
abiding by them," Zheng
said.

munity, which they said had
historically experienced
harsher forms of discrimina
tion than the kink community.
Despite this setback,
members of Kardinal Kink
have worked with the Sexual
Health and Peer Resource
Center (SHPRC) to host sev
eral events on kink-related
topics, including a well-at
tended event on polyamorous
relationships. The group also
regularly brings in experts
from the community to edu
cate members about kink-re
lated topics, including rope
tying, erotic hypnosis and
dominant/submissive rela
tionships.
Members of the group
are quick to stress that these
meetings are not overtly sex
ual, and that no sex or nudity
occurs during any presenta
tions or during group meet
ings. The group seeks to in
form, teach, support and
unite members of the kink
community, not to provide a
space for sexual activity.
Becoming a member of
Kardinal Kink is not as easy
as signing up on their web
site. One member of the
group, a sophomore who
goes by the pseudonym
Nothing, said that often
times new members of the
group come in with unrealis
tic expectations of what the
kink community is.

"Often when it comes to

Kink, you just interact with
things online," she said. "The
result is you never really
hear about kink in a serious,
realistic conversation."

When a person wishes to
join the group, they must
first meet face-to-face with
at least one member of Kar
dinal Kink and confirm they
understand the basic rules of
the group.

"You need more than a
basic understanding of the
meaning of 'no,'" Foreman
said, stressing the impor
tance of active consent in the
kink community. "The em
phasis here tends to be on
'yes means yes.'"
Lily Zheng 'l7 is one of
the few members willing to
cast off anonymity, and
would have become the offi
cial president of the organi
zation had they received
University approval. The
freshman said that she rel
ishes her role as a public
face of the Stanford kink
community.
"A really good thing about
being out is that by defying
perceptions, I get to change
those perceptions," she said.
"If I don't treat it as some
thing different or scary or
exotic, then people are more
willing to talk about it."
Zheng acknowledged that
being open about her kinki
ness may prevent her from
running for office or hurt her
in applying for some jobs.
She framed those draw
backs, however, as a worth
while sacrifice, saying that
she asked herself "Do I want
to get into a position to
change society which

means not being out or do
I want to do a more grass
roots [style] of organizing?"
Zheng said that she has
been able to reach new audi
ences of Stanford students
through the latter option.

"You can talk to a lot of
different people and advo
cate for kink conversa
tions you usually aren't able
to have without outing your
self," she said.
The fate of the group is
still unknown, pending a new
application and review by
SAL. Harvard approved
Harvard Munch, a similar
student group centered on
kink-related education and
discussion, in November of
2012. Columbia, Yale, MIT,
Tufts and University of
Chicago have also approved
similar groups. If they gain
official approval, Kardinal
Kink will be able to formally
host external speakers, re
cruit new members openly,
flyer and receive funding
from student fees.

Regardless of the out
come of their petition, how
ever, the group has already
made waves and provided a
space for kink-minded indi
viduals to meet, talk and ed
ucate themselves. Doing so
without University ap
proval fits in with the
group's larger mission to
change perceptions, accord
ing to members.
"You can't change the so
cial norms if you are busy
abiding by them," Zheng
said.

Kardinal Kink meets in an un
marked room in Kimball Hall. The
group, which recently had its peti
tion to become recognized as a stu
dent group by the University re
jected by Student Activities and
Leadership (SAL), serves as a sup
port and advocacy group for the
kink community at Stanford and
draws anywhere from eight to 30 at
tendees at their meetings.

"Part of the reason we come to
this environment is for the affirma
tion that there are other people who
experience the quote-unquote
"weird" things we do," said Fore
man 'l3, one of the members who
was comfortable talking to a re
porter using a pseudonym. "Identi
fying as 'kink' tends to over-sexual
ize you, which isn't always the case."
Kink is a broad term encompass
ing any non-traditional sexual activ
ity. Bondage, sadism and
masochism, fetishism the range
of kinky activities is as diverse as
the people who enjoy them. What
unites the members of Kardinal
Kink, however, is the desire to
break the silence and engage in
meaningful discussion about these
issues on Stanford campus.
The group has faced obstacles to
attaining those objectives. SALs re
jection of their petition to become a
voluntary student organization
(VSO) prompted one member of the
group to tell Salon.com that the
University was discriminating
against them "for the same reasons
LGBT-type groups were getting re
jected a few decades ago."
Nanci Howe, the director of Stu
dent Activities and Leadership, de
clined to give an interview to The
Daily for this story. The members of
Kardinal Kink were equally hesi
tant to speak about the process, de
clining to give details regarding the
delay. Several of them did express
reservations about comparing
themselves to the LGBT com
