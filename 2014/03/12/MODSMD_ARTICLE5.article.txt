## Cardinal Clinics adapts to Obamacare 
### VANESSA OCHAVILLO DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
With the deadline for enrollment in the
Affordable Care Act's health insurance
marketplaces less than three weeks away,
University-affiliated volunteers at the Pa
cific Free Clinic (PFC) one of two Stan
ford-funded, volunteer-based local clinics
have recently focused on ensuring as
many uninsured patients as possible have
signed up.
Despite increased outreach efforts by
state authorities and the PFC over the last

year, administrators noted the challenge of
even ensuring that all prospective patients
are aware of the deadline.

"Getting all eligible patients enrolled in
an insurance plan took longer than expect
ed," said Rhonda McClinton-Brown, exec
utive director of the Office of Community
Health, which oversees the Cardinal Free
Clinics program.
The PFC serves populations in East
San Jose, where 94 percent of patients are
uninsured.

"Even though there are billboards and
radio ads, people still don't know what that

means for [them]," McClinton-Brown said.
"They still don't realize that there's some
thing that they could be doing."
Under the recent expansion of Medi-
Cal, the state's health insurance program
that provides insurance to low-income indi
viduals, more PFC patients are now eligi
ble for affordable health care options but
are unaware they qualify.
"Many of these patients have gone
uninsured for most of their lives, and they
have not adjusted to the changes under the
ACA," McClinton-Brown said.
To address that lack of aware
ness, PFC created an insurance en
rollment department last year that
focuses its efforts on keeping track
of the changes in the mandate in
order to accurately inform patients
about the different insurance op
tions available. Because the PFC
volunteers are not certified enroll
ment counselors, however, the cen
ter relies on partnerships with pri
mary care clinics in the region to
help patients enroll in programs
for which they qualify.
"As the ACA was rolling out,
the community partners under
went major changes in the services
they were offering," said Christine
Yeh 'l6, co-director of the insur
ance enrollment department at
the PFC. "And because the com
munity partners were making
their changes at different times,
PFC volunteers were frequently
revising and re-packaging the in
formation they were presenting to
their patients."

Yeh recalled how volunteers had
to caution patients that the materi
al might be outdated.
"At one point in winter and
spring quarters last year, we would
sometimes feel really, really be
hind," she said. "Because we're stu
dents as well we can't know what
each clinic in the area is doing in
terms of the changes of the ACA."

Even as details of the mandate
become more firmly established,
volunteers acknowledged that the
process of obtaining insurance re
mains complicated.
"The process by which eligibili
ty is determined is rather cumber
some still and a little bit clunky,"
said Baldeep Singh, one of the co
directors of Cardinal Free Clinics.

Singh said that volunteers at
the free clinics have become more
efficient at referring patients to
the proper primary care facilities.
Between 10 and 15 percent of pa
tients screened are identified as

being eligible for some insurance.

Covered California
Volunteers emphasized the val
ue of Covered California, a new
state health insurance exchange
that compiles the various insurance
options available. Previously, vol
unteers had to keep a running list
of the different programs in the
area.

Despite the existence of inter
net services, many patients still re
ly on the help of the PFC coun
selors — many of whom speak
Mandarin or Spanish —to navi
gate the website with them. Thir
teen percent of the PFC patients
are Chinese and 16 percent are
Hispanic.

"The insurance enrollment
counselors often work one-on-one
with individuals or whole families
who visit the clinic to ensure that
they receive all of the benefits they
may be eligible for," Yeh said.
Counselors are usually able to
match around 15 cases either in
dividuals or families with insur
ance programs.

Back-up
Although insurance programs
have been expanded and options
centralized for better navigability,
many patients "still fall through
the cracks," according to McClin
ton-Brown. She noted that the clin
ic sees a large number of undocu
mented immigrants who aren't
eligible for the ACA's expanded
coverage as well as patients who
worry that insurance premiums
will still be too expensive despite
federal and state financial assis
tance.

"Having health insurance is a
great thing but living in [Silicon
Valley], having to pay a premium
can be overwhelming for that pop
ulation," she said.
In response, the PFC, as well as
the Arbor Free Clinic, refers pa
tients to other insurance programs
that do not fall under the state's in
surance program. For example, one
of these other insurance programs
Point Care does not look at
legal status.

ble for affordable health care options but
are unaware they qualify.
"Many of these patients have gone
uninsured for most of their lives, and they
have not adjusted to the changes under the
ACA," McClinton-Brown said.
To address that lack of aware
ness, PFC created an insurance en
rollment department last year that
focuses its efforts on keeping track
of the changes in the mandate in
order to accurately inform patients
about the different insurance op
tions available. Because the PFC
volunteers are not certified enroll
ment counselors, however, the cen
ter relies on partnerships with pri
mary care clinics in the region to
help patients enroll in programs
for which they qualify.
"As the ACA was rolling out,
the community partners under
went major changes in the services
they were offering," said Christine
Yeh 'l6, co-director of the insur
ance enrollment department at
the PFC. "And because the com
munity partners were making
their changes at different times,
PFC volunteers were frequently
revising and re-packaging the in
formation they were presenting to
their patients."

Yeh recalled how volunteers had
to caution patients that the materi
al might be outdated.
"At one point in winter and
spring quarters last year, we would
sometimes feel really, really be
hind," she said. "Because we're stu
dents as well we can't know what
each clinic in the area is doing in
terms of the changes of the ACA."

Even as details of the mandate
become more firmly established,
volunteers acknowledged that the
process of obtaining insurance re
mains complicated.
"The process by which eligibili
ty is determined is rather cumber
some still and a little bit clunky,"
said Baldeep Singh, one of the co
directors of Cardinal Free Clinics.

Singh said that volunteers at
the free clinics have become more
efficient at referring patients to
the proper primary care facilities.
Between 10 and 15 percent of pa
tients screened are identified as

being eligible for some insurance.

Covered California
Volunteers emphasized the val
ue of Covered California, a new
state health insurance exchange
that compiles the various insurance
options available. Previously, vol
unteers had to keep a running list
of the different programs in the
area.

Despite the existence of inter
net services, many patients still re
ly on the help of the PFC coun
selors — many of whom speak
Mandarin or Spanish —to navi
gate the website with them. Thir
teen percent of the PFC patients
are Chinese and 16 percent are
Hispanic.

"The insurance enrollment
counselors often work one-on-one
with individuals or whole families
who visit the clinic to ensure that
they receive all of the benefits they
may be eligible for," Yeh said.
Counselors are usually able to
match around 15 cases either in
dividuals or families with insur
ance programs.

Back-up
Although insurance programs
have been expanded and options
centralized for better navigability,
many patients "still fall through
the cracks," according to McClin
ton-Brown. She noted that the clin
ic sees a large number of undocu
mented immigrants who aren't
eligible for the ACA's expanded
coverage as well as patients who
worry that insurance premiums
will still be too expensive despite
federal and state financial assis
tance.

"Having health insurance is a
great thing but living in [Silicon
Valley], having to pay a premium
can be overwhelming for that pop
ulation," she said.
In response, the PFC, as well as
the Arbor Free Clinic, refers pa
tients to other insurance programs
that do not fall under the state's in
surance program. For example, one
of these other insurance programs
Point Care does not look at
legal status.

Cardinal Free Clinics has taken steps to inform its uninsured patients of
how to take advantage of the policies under the Affordable Care Act.
With the deadline for enrollment in the
Affordable Care Act's health insurance
marketplaces less than three weeks away,
University-affiliated volunteers at the Pa
cific Free Clinic (PFC) one of two Stan
ford-funded, volunteer-based local clinics
have recently focused on ensuring as
many uninsured patients as possible have
signed up.
Despite increased outreach efforts by
state authorities and the PFC over the last

year, administrators noted the challenge of
even ensuring that all prospective patients
are aware of the deadline.

"Getting all eligible patients enrolled in
an insurance plan took longer than expect
ed," said Rhonda McClinton-Brown, exec
utive director of the Office of Community
Health, which oversees the Cardinal Free
Clinics program.
The PFC serves populations in East
San Jose, where 94 percent of patients are
uninsured.

"Even though there are billboards and
radio ads, people still don't know what that

means for [them]," McClinton-Brown said.
"They still don't realize that there's some
thing that they could be doing."
Under the recent expansion of Medi-
Cal, the state's health insurance program
that provides insurance to low-income indi
viduals, more PFC patients are now eligi
ble for affordable health care options but
are unaware they qualify.
"Many of these patients have gone
uninsured for most of their lives, and they
have not adjusted to the changes under the
