## Cardinal Clinics adapts to Obamacare 
### VANESSA OCHAVILLO DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
With the deadline for enrollment in the
Affordable Care Act's health insurance
marketplaces less than three weeks away,
University-affiliated volunteers at the Pa
cific Free Clinic (PFC) one of two Stan
ford-funded, volunteer-based local clinics
have recently focused on ensuring as
many uninsured patients as possible have
signed up.
Despite increased outreach efforts by
state authorities and the PFC over the last

year, administrators noted the challenge of
even ensuring that all prospective patients
are aware of the deadline.

"Getting all eligible patients enrolled in
an insurance plan took longer than expect
ed," said Rhonda McClinton-Brown, exec
utive director of the Office of Community
Health, which oversees the Cardinal Free
Clinics program.
The PFC serves populations in East
San Jose, where 94 percent of patients are
uninsured.

"Even though there are billboards and
radio ads, people still don't know what that

means for [them]," McClinton-Brown said.
"They still don't realize that there's some
thing that they could be doing."
Under the recent expansion of Medi-
Cal, the state's health insurance program
that provides insurance to low-income indi
viduals, more PFC patients are now eligi
ble for affordable health care options but
are unaware they qualify.
"Many of these patients have gone
uninsured for most of their lives, and they
have not adjusted to the changes under the
ACA," McClinton-Brown said.
