## GSC pulls funding for 'anti-LGBT' event 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
Last Wednesday evening,
the Graduate Student Coun
cil (GSC) denied funding for
an event hosted by the Stan
ford Anscombe Society
(SAS) following community
outcry over alleged "anti-
LGBT" content.

SAS's April conference,
titled "Communicating Val
ues," has a two-fold purpose,
according to SAS president
Judith Romea 'l4, between
educating attendees on the
public policy issues sur
rounding marriage and fami
ly and exploring how media,
entertainment and technolo
gy can be used to better facil
itate the communication un
derlying marriage and the
family.
SAS had sought $6OO in
honoraria funds from the
GSC for conference speak
ers. However, members of
GradQ, the queer graduate
student organization, criti
cized the speaker list

which included Robert
Lopez, Kellie Fiedorek and
Ryan Anderson â€”as inap
propriately controversial.
Bringing the speakers to
Stanford would threaten the
safety of campus for the
queer population, according
to Brianne Huntsman 'l5,
who started a Facebook
event to organize a rally at
the GSC meeting on
Wednesday night.

"A lot of students who are
queer come to Stanford be
cause it's one of the most
LGBT-friendly places in the
world," Huntsman said. "I
grew up in Utah, where it
was really conservative and
a lot of us come from similar
backgrounds, and we feel
that we every time we go
home. Stanford is supposed
to be a safe space for us."
The GSC anticipated the
influx of members from the
community and changed
rooms for its weekly meeting
last Wednesday to accommo
date the nearly 100 people
who made it out to the coun
cil meeting.

GSC member Eduardo
Gonzalez-Maldonado, a de
velopmental biology gradu
ate student, emphasized the

challenges facing the GSC as
it made a decision. The GSC
had previously deferred the
decision whether to approve
the funding for the event or
not for an extra week.

"This issue walks a very
fine line between the free
dom of speech and the dis
crimination of a minority, but
no one has anything but the
right intentions in mind,"
Gonzalez-Maldonado said of
the GSC members' votes.

The GSC eventually vot
ed 10-2 against funding SAS
at the end of an extended
meeting.
As a general fees group,
SAS also reached out to the
Undergraduate Senate for
$5,000 in funding. However,
the appropriations commit
tee met with the group on
Thursday night and voted
not to recommend their
funding application.
According to Senate
Chair Ben Holston 'l5, one
senator voted in favor of rec
ommending the request,
while four expressed opposi
tion and one abstained.

Despite the lack of fund
ing, SAS's Communicating
Values Conference will still
go on, according to Romea.
The group will seek funding
from local organizations, a
process which will be in com
pliance with University
guidelines for event funding.
In hopes of decreasing
the tension between the two
groups, GradQ offered to co
sponsor an event in lieu of
the conference that SAS
would have put together.
However, SAS decided that
the conference could not be
replaced.
"We really do appreciate
GradQ's willingness to co
sponsor an event, and it's an
offer that we've accepted,
but we felt that such an offer
could not supplant the con
ference," Romea said, ex
plaining that reforming their
conference would render
their viewpoint censored.
"We are very eager to co
sponsor ... events in the fu
ture [the proposal] just
cannot supplant the current
plans."
