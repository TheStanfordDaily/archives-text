## Student privacy at Stanford analyzed 
### ALEX ZIVKOVIC DESK EDITOR 
On Feb. 25, the U.S. De
partment of Education re
leased a document providing
guidance to educators at the
K-12 and collegiate level
about how to best protect
student online privacy given
the increase in the use of on
line educational services.

In a public letter, U.S.
Secretary of Education Arne
Duncan said that "as an edu
cation community, we have to
do a far better job of helping
teachers and administrators
understand technology and
data issues so that they ap
propriately protect privacy
while ensuring teachers and
students have access to effec
tive and safe tools."

The guidance highlighted
parts of the Family Educa
tional Rights and Privacy
Act (FERPA) and the Pro
tection of Pupil Rights
Amendment (PPRA) related
to online education. Both of
these laws apply to K-12
schools as well as institutions
of higher education, like
Stanford.

While numerous sugges
tions were made to promote
administrative compliance
with privacy concerns, few of
these changes will affect
Stanford, which already has
such structures in place, said
David Behinfar, the Univer
sity's director of privacy.

Stanford's response
The guidance is largely in
response to a letter by Sena
tor Edward Markey from
October 2013 in which
Markey expressed concern
about how information is
protected when using online
resources.

Secretary Duncan agreed
with Senator Markey's con
cerns, highlighting the need
to emphasize what consti
tutes privacy violations
particularly in K-12 institu
tions.

"As you note, the efficient
collection, analysis, and stor
age of student information
can help educators find bet
ter ways to educate stu
dents," Duncan wrote in his
letter to Senator Markey.
"When outsourcing school
functions, however, schools
must ensure that vendors
and service providers are
properly protecting student
information."

The timing of this new
concern, Behinfar believes, is
related to the rapid increase
in online education that is oc
curring today.
"Whereas many years
ago, you would use a fax and
phone machine, today it's
email and video conferenc
ing," he said. "I think educa
tion is following that same
pattern because the youth of
today is so used to having
computers and texting and
emailing that the options for
online content, learning...
[is] expected almost."
The biggest challenge to
privacy concerns in the digi
tal age, Behinfar noted, is
that often violations can go
unnoticed by those who
aren't trained to see them.
However, he believes Stan
ford has committed to ad
dressing privacy concerns
and foresees little institu
tional change for most elite
universities, particularly
ones that are financially sta
ble at the moment.
"I understand it in re
spect to the K-12 aspect but
for higher education, I think
that this is something that
has been in place by having
these administrative re
sources so that that level of
review isn't being skipped or
overlooked," Behinfar said of
the guidelines.

Due to a lack of resources
that provide training for
teachers about these laws or
to handle legal complaints,
K-12 schools or public uni-
