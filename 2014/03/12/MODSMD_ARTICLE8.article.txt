## Student privacy at Stanford analyzed 
### ALEX ZIVKOVIC DESK EDITOR 
On Feb. 25, the U.S. De
partment of Education re
leased a document providing
guidance to educators at the
K-12 and collegiate level
about how to best protect
student online privacy given
the increase in the use of on
line educational services.

In a public letter, U.S.
Secretary of Education Arne
Duncan said that "as an edu
cation community, we have to
do a far better job of helping
teachers and administrators
understand technology and
data issues so that they ap
propriately protect privacy
while ensuring teachers and
students have access to effec
tive and safe tools."

The guidance highlighted
parts of the Family Educa
tional Rights and Privacy
Act (FERPA) and the Pro
tection of Pupil Rights
Amendment (PPRA) related
to online education. Both of
these laws apply to K-12
schools as well as institutions
of higher education, like
Stanford.

While numerous sugges
tions were made to promote
administrative compliance
with privacy concerns, few of
these changes will affect
Stanford, which already has
such structures in place, said
David Behinfar, the Univer
sity's director of privacy.

Stanford's response
The guidance is largely in
response to a letter by Sena
tor Edward Markey from
October 2013 in which
Markey expressed concern
about how information is
protected when using online
resources.

Secretary Duncan agreed
with Senator Markey's con
cerns, highlighting the need
to emphasize what consti
tutes privacy violations
particularly in K-12 institu
tions.

"As you note, the efficient
collection, analysis, and stor
age of student information
can help educators find bet
ter ways to educate stu
dents," Duncan wrote in his
letter to Senator Markey.
"When outsourcing school
functions, however, schools
must ensure that vendors
and service providers are
properly protecting student
information."

The timing of this new
concern, Behinfar believes, is
related to the rapid increase
in online education that is oc
curring today.
"Whereas many years
ago, you would use a fax and
phone machine, today it's
email and video conferenc
ing," he said. "I think educa
tion is following that same
pattern because the youth of
today is so used to having
computers and texting and
emailing that the options for
online content, learning...
[is] expected almost."
The biggest challenge to
privacy concerns in the digi
tal age, Behinfar noted, is
that often violations can go
unnoticed by those who
aren't trained to see them.
However, he believes Stan
ford has committed to ad
dressing privacy concerns
and foresees little institu
tional change for most elite
universities, particularly
ones that are financially sta
ble at the moment.
"I understand it in re
spect to the K-12 aspect but
for higher education, I think
that this is something that
has been in place by having
these administrative re
sources so that that level of
review isn't being skipped or
overlooked," Behinfar said of
the guidelines.

Due to a lack of resources
that provide training for
teachers about these laws or
to handle legal complaints,
K-12 schools or public uni-
versities with financial difficulties
may not be able to keep up with the
changing online landscape, Behin
far noted, unlike institutions like
Stanford which handle privacy is
sues through multiple offices.
"We have a whole legal depart
ment, we have IT security depart
ment, we have a privacy office, we
have a number of academic offices
that have administrative responsi
bilities and a procurement office,
which really all contribute to pro
tecting privacy in important ways,"
Behinfar said.

Registrar privacy concerns
Stanford, with Course Work and
the use of online transcripts, has
led the way in terms of using online
resources securely, but it also
treats internal information with
the same scrutiny.

Stephen Shirreffs, associate
University registrar, explained
that his department works closely
with IT and legal departments to
keep internal records on students
protected.
"There's four kinds of data: pro
hibited, restricted, confidential and
public," Shirreffs said. "So student
records come under confidential
and there's a certain set of rules
that apply to confidential data
we just follow them, strictly."
"For our systems, we are first

adopters of any security directives
from the information security of
fice," Shirreffs added.
Beyond technical security, there
is also a clear list of who can gain
access to which types of files.
Through this process, simple tasks
by administrators like checking
units for graduation can be done
without additional review.

Shirreffs noted that he person
ally never has access to student
records because his office is in
charge of protecting and then shar
ing information with those with a
"legitimate" need most often ad
ministrators, though occasionally
legal entities.
"There are authority structures
in place for using the student infor
mation system which specify who
can look at what records, and typi
cally we are looking at administra
tors who are looking at data entries
or making determinations about
your academic progress, or your
advisor," Shirreffs explained. "So
your advisor has a special authority
to look into your information."
Beyond holding academic infor
mation and enrollment data, the
Registrar also actively collects
and then protects information
from students during the academic
year. One such example is the an
nual student check-in, which must
be completed during winter quar
ter in order to lift the class enroll
ment hold for spring quarter.
"Student check-in is an attempt
by us to collect various information
that we have an interest in having
or that is federally mandated,"

Shirreffs said. "All of that informa
tion is strictly private unless it is
covered by directory information.
For example, we collect ethnicity
there for federal reporting purpos
es, but you're also allowed to de
cline to state."

Some information on students,
however, is automatically public.
This is called directory information
and includes the student's name,
email address and information on
the student's academic association
with Stanford, including degrees
earned, field of study and student
theses.

All information except for name
can be removed from the website
through a student's request. To re
move one's name, one must under
go a total FERPA block, which is
rare.

"A total FERPA block means
we couldn't even admit that you at
tended this University," Shirreffs
explained, noting that there have
been cases, but that they are rare
and require an application and a
discussion with the Registrar's of
fice.

While the Registrar focuses
mostly on student data and securi
ty, Behinfar noted that Stanford's
dedication to privacy extends be
yond protecting students.
"It's not just student data," Be
hinfar said. "There's several class
es of information that have this
heightened level of scrutiny and
need for protections."

sources so that that level of
review isn't being skipped or
overlooked," Behinfar said of
the guidelines.

Due to a lack of resources
that provide training for
teachers about these laws or
to handle legal complaints,
K-12 schools or public uni-
versities with financial difficulties
may not be able to keep up with the
changing online landscape, Behin
far noted, unlike institutions like
Stanford which handle privacy is
sues through multiple offices.
"We have a whole legal depart
ment, we have IT security depart
ment, we have a privacy office, we
have a number of academic offices
that have administrative responsi
bilities and a procurement office,
which really all contribute to pro
tecting privacy in important ways,"
Behinfar said.

Registrar privacy concerns
Stanford, with Course Work and
the use of online transcripts, has
led the way in terms of using online
resources securely, but it also
treats internal information with
the same scrutiny.

Stephen Shirreffs, associate
University registrar, explained
that his department works closely
with IT and legal departments to
keep internal records on students
protected.
"There's four kinds of data: pro
hibited, restricted, confidential and
public," Shirreffs said. "So student
records come under confidential
and there's a certain set of rules
that apply to confidential data
we just follow them, strictly."
"For our systems, we are first

adopters of any security directives
from the information security of
fice," Shirreffs added.
Beyond technical security, there
is also a clear list of who can gain
access to which types of files.
Through this process, simple tasks
by administrators like checking
units for graduation can be done
without additional review.

Shirreffs noted that he person
ally never has access to student
records because his office is in
charge of protecting and then shar
ing information with those with a
"legitimate" need most often ad
ministrators, though occasionally
legal entities.
"There are authority structures
in place for using the student infor
mation system which specify who
can look at what records, and typi
cally we are looking at administra
tors who are looking at data entries
or making determinations about
your academic progress, or your
advisor," Shirreffs explained. "So
your advisor has a special authority
to look into your information."
Beyond holding academic infor
mation and enrollment data, the
Registrar also actively collects
and then protects information
from students during the academic
year. One such example is the an
nual student check-in, which must
be completed during winter quar
ter in order to lift the class enroll
ment hold for spring quarter.
"Student check-in is an attempt
by us to collect various information
that we have an interest in having
or that is federally mandated,"

Shirreffs said. "All of that informa
tion is strictly private unless it is
covered by directory information.
For example, we collect ethnicity
there for federal reporting purpos
es, but you're also allowed to de
cline to state."

Some information on students,
however, is automatically public.
This is called directory information
and includes the student's name,
email address and information on
the student's academic association
with Stanford, including degrees
earned, field of study and student
theses.

All information except for name
can be removed from the website
through a student's request. To re
move one's name, one must under
go a total FERPA block, which is
rare.

"A total FERPA block means
we couldn't even admit that you at
tended this University," Shirreffs
explained, noting that there have
been cases, but that they are rare
and require an application and a
discussion with the Registrar's of
fice.

While the Registrar focuses
mostly on student data and securi
ty, Behinfar noted that Stanford's
dedication to privacy extends be
yond protecting students.
"It's not just student data," Be
hinfar said. "There's several class
es of information that have this
heightened level of scrutiny and
need for protections."

On Feb. 25, the U.S. De
partment of Education re
leased a document providing
guidance to educators at the
K-12 and collegiate level
about how to best protect
student online privacy given
the increase in the use of on
line educational services.

In a public letter, U.S.
Secretary of Education Arne
Duncan said that "as an edu
cation community, we have to
do a far better job of helping
teachers and administrators
understand technology and
data issues so that they ap
propriately protect privacy
while ensuring teachers and
students have access to effec
tive and safe tools."

The guidance highlighted
parts of the Family Educa
tional Rights and Privacy
Act (FERPA) and the Pro
tection of Pupil Rights
Amendment (PPRA) related
to online education. Both of
these laws apply to K-12
schools as well as institutions
of higher education, like
Stanford.

While numerous sugges
tions were made to promote
administrative compliance
with privacy concerns, few of
these changes will affect
Stanford, which already has
such structures in place, said
David Behinfar, the Univer
sity's director of privacy.

Stanford's response
The guidance is largely in
response to a letter by Sena
tor Edward Markey from
October 2013 in which
Markey expressed concern
about how information is
protected when using online
resources.

Secretary Duncan agreed
with Senator Markey's con
cerns, highlighting the need
to emphasize what consti
tutes privacy violations
particularly in K-12 institu
tions.

"As you note, the efficient
collection, analysis, and stor
age of student information
can help educators find bet
ter ways to educate stu
dents," Duncan wrote in his
letter to Senator Markey.
"When outsourcing school
functions, however, schools
must ensure that vendors
and service providers are
properly protecting student
information."

The timing of this new
concern, Behinfar believes, is
related to the rapid increase
in online education that is oc
curring today.
"Whereas many years
ago, you would use a fax and
phone machine, today it's
email and video conferenc
ing," he said. "I think educa
tion is following that same
pattern because the youth of
today is so used to having
computers and texting and
emailing that the options for
online content, learning...
[is] expected almost."
The biggest challenge to
privacy concerns in the digi
tal age, Behinfar noted, is
that often violations can go
unnoticed by those who
aren't trained to see them.
However, he believes Stan
ford has committed to ad
dressing privacy concerns
and foresees little institu
tional change for most elite
universities, particularly
ones that are financially sta
ble at the moment.
"I understand it in re
spect to the K-12 aspect but
for higher education, I think
that this is something that
has been in place by having
these administrative re
sources so that that level of
review isn't being skipped or
overlooked," Behinfar said of
the guidelines.
