# STUDENT LIFE
## Stanford Humans captures campus 
### TIFFANY LAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Inspired by the popular
blog "Humans of New York,"
"Stanford Humans" has
more recently sought to cap
ture life on campus in a simi
lar way through pictures
posted on a Facebook page.
In 2010, Brandon Stanton
created "Humans of New
York" to give a worldwide au
dience glimpses into the lives
of New York City strangers
through an extensive collec
tion of photos and quotes.
The page's popularity sky
rocketed over the next four
years to encompass over 3.5
million likes on Facebook
and a published book of the
pictures.

Inspired by Stanton's
work, Jae-Young Son 'l6
launched "Stanford Hu
mans" in December 2013.
Despite its short time in exis
tence, the blog's Facebook
page has gained over 850
likes and hosted nearly 300
photos.

In addition to document
ing events like the Stanford
Spoken Word Collective's
BODIES workshop and the
Lunar New Year Festival,
Son said that he focuses on
capturing photos and quotes
from members of the campus
community from students
to the Saxophone Man.

"I bike around until I find
somebody who catches my
eye for whatever reason.
There's no method to it," Son
said. "I approach whoever
happens to look interesting
to me at that particular
time."

Rather than using a
recorder or taking notes,
Son said that he recalls
quotes from memory.
"Getting exact quotes is
n't my main concern," he ex
plained. "There's always a
spirit to what someone is
saying, and I want to capture
that and their voices."
While a "Humans of Stan
ford" page had previously

sought to emulate "Humans
of New York," Son empha
sized the unrelated nature of
his effort.

"That page hadn't been
updated in a really long time
so I figured it would be okay
to start my own," Son said.
"I'm not worried about if
other people do it anyway
I don't feel a sense of compe
tition."

Son framed his objectives
as extending beyond just
replicating "Humans of New
York," noting that assuming
a role in the editing process
has merits of its own.

"I started the page for my
own sanity" Son said. "It let
me channel some of my frus
tration into something artis
tic."

"I want to disregard the
political implications of pho

tography," he added. "Like
my favorite street photogra
pher, Garry Winogrand, I
have a strong affiliation for
pure aesthetics. There are
multiple photos I don't end
up posting if I, as a photogra
pher, failed to capture some
thing interesting."
However, students have
expressed mixed responses
to the page.
"I think it's good â€”it
makes people happy," said
Katrina Gutierrez 'l6, a past
subject of a "Stanford Hu
mans" photo. "I'm not really
sure what his mission is
though. And the quote was
n't accurate that's not ac
tually what I said. But I did
n't really care. The photo
was fine."

"After he approached me,
I didn't think anyone would

read my quote because the
page seemed pretty boring,
unlike 'Humans of New
York'," commented another
subject, who wished to re
main anonymous. "He just
asked me what classes I was
taking and what my major
was. He also got my quote
wrong."
Son said that he is unde
cided as to how long he will
continue to update "Stanford
Humans."
"I don't know... until it's
not an engaging exercise for
me," Son said. "There's no
concrete reason I'm doing
this other than [that] I like it.
So if that ever changes, I
don't feel like I have a re
sponsibility to keep it up."

Last December, sophomore Jae-Young Son created the Facebook page "Stanford Humans" to document life on the
Farm. He was inspired by the blog "Humans of New York," which posts photographs of strangers along with quotes.
