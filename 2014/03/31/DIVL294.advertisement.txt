Campus Business Development Associate wanted!
Hello,
My name is David Espiritu and I am The Princeton Review's Business Development
Manager for Graduate Programs in Northern California.
It's a big territory, so I'm hiring representatives for all of our target universities.
This position is extremely flexible and provides great BizDev/Marketing experience.
Essentially, you would be my outreach and physical presence for when I am not on
campus.
Some potential duties include event coordination, student group liaising, connecting
with advisors and departments, and informational/marketing presentations.
My ideal candidates are sophomores or well-connected freshmen with interpersonal
skills and marketing/campaigning experience. The latter is not necessary but would
be nice.
The position is a hybrid of base pay and commissions/incentives. There are rewards
for originality and I encourage creativity and grassroots strategies.
Contact me at DEspiritu@review.com or 916-934-4118 for more information. You can
also find me on Linkedln.
David
Best,
