## The new Stanford Daily.com: Embracing the digital-first age
### Joseph Beyda 
As you might have noticed,
things look a bit different
over here in our little corner
of the web.
Over spring break, The Stan
ford Daily proudly launched its new
website, the product of three
months of hard work by our entire
editorial staff. As Editor in Chief
George Chen put it in his Editor's
Welcome in February, "The Stan
ford Daily is a digital-first media
company," and we couldn't be more
excited to unveil a site that gives
us so many opportunities to fulfill
that vision.
But before I get to those be
hind-the-scenes improvements,
here's some of what's already
changed for you, our readers.
The first thing you'll notice is
our site's new look, intended to
blend the sleek appearance of a
modern news site with the serif
fonts and Old English logo you're
accustomed to in our print product.
Many redesigns end with a new
look; that's just where we got
started.
In the past, the experience of
using Stanford Daily.com changed
drastically on a mobile device. You
were forced to choose between our
full site, whose text was too small to
read without zooming in and manu
ally dragging each line back and
forth, and mobile theme that was
noticeably stripped down. That's no
longer the case.
Pull up this article on your
phone or tablet. We dare you.
Here at The Daily, we've finally
caught the wave of responsive de
sign, which means that every ele
ment of our site will automatically
resize and reshuffle depending on
your screen size. That will provide
you both the readability of a mobile
theme and the functionality of a
desktop site â€”no more compro
mises. (And, most importantly, it
means you can now read The Stan
ford Daily in class.)
Previously, we've also lagged be
hind somewhat when it came to our
use of multimedia. But what frus
trated the editorial team the most
in that regard was that we weren't
really held back by a lack of con
tent. Our photographers produce
far more high-quality shots than
we've had the chance to feature,
and thanks to the inspired work of
Victor Xu and others this year,
we've developed an ability to tell
stories graphically as well.
To address those issues, we've
transitioned to a new media gallery
tool that finally does these people's
work justice. We hope that our re

vamped Multimedia section be
comes as much a part of the fabric
of Stanford Daily.com as the rest of
our content, so expect photo gal
leries and graphics to start creeping
into our articles much more often.
Through this redesign, we've al
so looked for ways to highlight
what makes student journalism
truly unique: the students. Our in
sightful columnists are featured on
this site they like never have been
before, whether it's on our home
page, in our redesigned menu or in
the sidebar of every Sports or
Opinions article.
Similarly, we've rethought how
we package our Weekend Edition,
one of The Daily's hallmarks this
year, with a brand-new archive
page that lets you revisit all of the
topics we've explored so far.
Social media is another element
that we've woven into this site, be
tween the Twitter ticker on every
page, the social corner on the
homepage or the customized Twit
ter feeds we've added to the side
bar of every News and Sports arti
cle. Our goal is to make Stanford-
Daily.com your one-stop shop for
Stanford news, whoever is provid
ing it and hopefully a place to
feature the online conversations
most relevant to the Farm.
Something else you might notice
is a little box at the bottom of all of
our new articles, part of a cutting
edge subscription service called
News@me that we hope will
change the way you get your news
from us. If you'd like to receive a
daily digest of articles customized
to your own interests, all you have
to do is subscribe at the bottom of a
post by entering your email ad
dress, which will be linked to a
handful of tags describing the
post's topic. Afterwards, you'll re
ceive at most one email a day with a
list of stories whose tags match the
ones you've subscribed to. From
this email, you can deactivate any
of the tags you've subscribed to or
unsubscribe altogether, allowing
you to completely personalize the
news you receive from us. (Users of
our existing daily digest: Don't
worry, that's here to stay too.)
As I mentioned earlier, there
are a lot of administrative benefits
to this site as well: more flexibility
in how we manage our homepage,
more ways to signal breaking news
to our readers and more ways to
feature the special content that
we've come to expect from our tal
ented staff.
