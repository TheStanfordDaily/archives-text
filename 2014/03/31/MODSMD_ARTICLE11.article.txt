# The testosteroom welcomes one
## 
### Liam Kinney 
I live in Synergy. I have 5 room
mates. We live between 2
rooms on separate floors, and
hold tenuous reign over a tiny
third, which we use as a projector
room (only holds a couch and a cof
fee table). We sleep in the double
sized room and live in the triple.
Two of my roommates snore loudly.
One of these boys' closets is direct
ly next to my desk, and wet neo
prene is no friend of mine. All five
of my roommates lack the stom
achs for a vegetarian house and
their insides complain loudly and
regularly. This is a story of clan
destine aggression, brotherhood
and guilt. This is also an apology.
The way the room setup is es
tablished at Synergy and
reestablished every quarter â€”is
by a loud, mimosa-fueled, uneasily
polite meeting at 9:00 sharp the
Sunday morning before classes. It
was the beginning of Winter Quar
ter, and in order to lock down our
double-triple setup for the second
quarter in a row, we needed to take
on a fifth. Attempts to finagle some
of the notorious chill bros out of
their comfy doubles fell flat:
"Um, yeah, I'll get back to you."
"Oh hey, that sounds cool! I just
wanted to check with Andrew and
see if he had a roommate yet."
"I haven't seen Kevin, but I'm
pretty sure he wants to live with
Jon."
Or, of course, the ever-dreaded
"Thanks but I'm good."
Our seemingly permanent quad
was just about out of hope when a
too-excited dormmate popped out
of nowhere. "Hey guys! I heard
you're looking for a sixth. Mark
doesn't get here until Tuesday but
I'm his proxy and he said he'd be
down for anything. What do you
guys think?"

Before I could voice my suspi
cion at (1) an emotion experienced
at a rooming meeting that was any
thing other than thinly veiled panic
and (2) the fact that a boy with
bags under his eyes was trying to
pawn off the kid on his bottom
bunk, my roommate jumped in,
"Yeah, we'd love to have him!"
We went about the following
cheery move-in days in delusion
until Tuesday night/Wednesday
morning. Then, we 11... I'll just de
scribe it for you.
1:37 A.M. I wake up from dying
in a deafening plane crash. A jet
engine's got nothing on apnea.
1:59 A.M. I fashion makeshift
ear muffs out of my two pillows. I
think as loudly as I can.
2:40 A.M. A lawn mower runs
over a cheese grater, or something
like that.
4:02 A.M. I start writing these
times down so I can angrily show
him his problem in the morning.
7:30 A.M. I wake up hours be
fore my alarm (but hours after I
could hit snooze in the daylight) to
a tractor going through the wall.
It wasn't long before my room
mates did what we could in re
sponse to this nasal nightmare
make fun of him. Don't get me
wrong: We made it clear from the
get-go that he could shatter a wine
glass at close range with his REM.
But none of us had the decency or
communication skills to tell him
that it was giving us all red alerts.
Before one fateful night shortly be
fore Spring Break, we were one
quip shy of a burn book.
While procrastinating yester
day afternoon, I struck up a con
versation with Mark's girlfriend's
roommate. It was garden variety
