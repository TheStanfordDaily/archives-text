# The 						testosteroom welcomes one
## 
### Liam Kinney 
I live in Synergy. I have 5 room
mates. We live between 2
rooms on separate floors, and
hold tenuous reign over a tiny
third, which we use as a projector
room (only holds a couch and a cof
fee table). We sleep in the double
sized room and live in the triple.
Two of my roommates snore loudly.
One of these boys' closets is direct
ly next to my desk, and wet neo
prene is no friend of mine. All five
of my roommates lack the stom
achs for a vegetarian house and
their insides complain loudly and
regularly. This is a story of clan
destine aggression, brotherhood
and guilt. This is also an apology.
The way the room setup is es
tablished at Synergy and
reestablished every quarter —is
by a loud, mimosa-fueled, uneasily
polite meeting at 9:00 sharp the
Sunday morning before classes. It
was the beginning of Winter Quar
ter, and in order to lock down our
double-triple setup for the second
quarter in a row, we needed to take
on a fifth. Attempts to finagle some
of the notorious chill bros out of
their comfy doubles fell flat:
"Um, yeah, I'll get back to you."
"Oh hey, that sounds cool! I just
wanted to check with Andrew and
see if he had a roommate yet."
"I haven't seen Kevin, but I'm
pretty sure he wants to live with
Jon."
Or, of course, the ever-dreaded
"Thanks but I'm good."
Our seemingly permanent quad
was just about out of hope when a
too-excited dormmate popped out
of nowhere. "Hey guys! I heard
you're looking for a sixth. Mark
doesn't get here until Tuesday but
I'm his proxy and he said he'd be
down for anything. What do you
guys think?"

Before I could voice my suspi
cion at (1) an emotion experienced
at a rooming meeting that was any
thing other than thinly veiled panic
and (2) the fact that a boy with
bags under his eyes was trying to
pawn off the kid on his bottom
bunk, my roommate jumped in,
"Yeah, we'd love to have him!"
We went about the following
cheery move-in days in delusion
until Tuesday night/Wednesday
morning. Then, we 11... I'll just de
scribe it for you.
1:37 A.M. I wake up from dying
in a deafening plane crash. A jet
engine's got nothing on apnea.
1:59 A.M. I fashion makeshift
ear muffs out of my two pillows. I
think as loudly as I can.
2:40 A.M. A lawn mower runs
over a cheese grater, or something
like that.
4:02 A.M. I start writing these
times down so I can angrily show
him his problem in the morning.
7:30 A.M. I wake up hours be
fore my alarm (but hours after I
could hit snooze in the daylight) to
a tractor going through the wall.
It wasn't long before my room
mates did what we could in re
sponse to this nasal nightmare
make fun of him. Don't get me
wrong: We made it clear from the
get-go that he could shatter a wine
glass at close range with his REM.
But none of us had the decency or
communication skills to tell him
that it was giving us all red alerts.
Before one fateful night shortly be
fore Spring Break, we were one
quip shy of a burn book.
While procrastinating yester
day afternoon, I struck up a con
versation with Mark's girlfriend's
roommate. It was garden variety
banter and schadenfreude
until she brought up how
she had kicked Mark to the
curb a week previous for,
yes, snoring. That intel real
ly ground my gears: We
weren't telling him how loud
he was, but here was solid
evidence that he knew and
simply didn't care. The fact
that he still slept with us
was just gross negligence.
I spoke to him later with
blazing conviction: "Mark!
uh, hey, how's your day?"
Trying to disguise the inter
vention as dinner conversa
tion, I continued, "I just
wanted to let you know that
there have been some
anonymous complaints
about your snoring. I think
you might just have to move
out. Didn't you say you used
to sleep in your van?"
I felt like the supervisor
from Office Space. I didn't
even know if he could hear
me straight through all that

passive aggression.
"Oh, well that's fine. My
girlfriend doesn't really like
it out there, but I guess I
can. I wish you had told me
sooner. I feel bad."
"Damn," I thought, "I
wish I had told him sooner."
After six weeks of high
school-girl-style hating be
tween the other roommates,
this guy was the nicest kid
in our room. Now, just be
cause I couldn't communi
cate, my roommates and I
bear the guilt and the re
morse of having lost a gen
uine friend.
Let this be a lesson to all
barely tolerant roommates.
The "college roommate" has
the potential to be a staple
relationship in life, for what
person in your life ever
comes closer to the role of
sibling? Unspoken conflict
is a golden apple of discord.
Be open with your room
mates and you could soon be
the next Moskovitz, or Brin
or Wilson (because Owen
Wilson and Wes Anderson
were roommates; dull). I
couldn't take my own ad
vice, and now here I am, sit

ting sleepless and cold on
the porch, looking at the van
where I should be. I'm sor
ry, Mark, and I hope your
future roommates are more
upfront with you.
My opinion is this: A lot
of us come into college
thinking that we're going to
be good friends with
whichever roommates we're
stuck with, and a lot of us
aren't, and that's usually a
mistake. We shut the door
on that opportunity too
soon. We stigmatize the
roommate as the one who
sexiles, or the one who runs
his coffee maker too loud, or
the one who won't clean up
his side of the room (I even
have to empty the trash can
on his side). This leads to a
distance between room
mates, and it's a shame. We
are paying a fortune every
few months to hear the per
spectives of smart people.
So if you have roommate
problems, why won't you lis
ten to the one right next to
you?

you might just have to move
out. Didn't you say you used
to sleep in your van?"
I felt like the supervisor
from Office Space. I didn't
even know if he could hear
me straight through all that

passive aggression.
"Oh, well that's fine. My
girlfriend doesn't really like
it out there, but I guess I
can. I wish you had told me
sooner. I feel bad."
"Damn," I thought, "I
wish I had told him sooner."
After six weeks of high
school-girl-style hating be
tween the other roommates,
this guy was the nicest kid
in our room. Now, just be
cause I couldn't communi
cate, my roommates and I
bear the guilt and the re
morse of having lost a gen
uine friend.
Let this be a lesson to all
barely tolerant roommates.
The "college roommate" has
the potential to be a staple
relationship in life, for what
person in your life ever
comes closer to the role of
sibling? Unspoken conflict
is a golden apple of discord.
Be open with your room
mates and you could soon be
the next Moskovitz, or Brin
or Wilson (because Owen
Wilson and Wes Anderson
were roommates; dull). I
couldn't take my own ad
vice, and now here I am, sit

ting sleepless and cold on
the porch, looking at the van
where I should be. I'm sor
ry, Mark, and I hope your
future roommates are more
upfront with you.
My opinion is this: A lot
of us come into college
thinking that we're going to
be good friends with
whichever roommates we're
stuck with, and a lot of us
aren't, and that's usually a
mistake. We shut the door
on that opportunity too
soon. We stigmatize the
roommate as the one who
sexiles, or the one who runs
his coffee maker too loud, or
the one who won't clean up
his side of the room (I even
have to empty the trash can
on his side). This leads to a
distance between room
mates, and it's a shame. We
are paying a fortune every
few months to hear the per
spectives of smart people.
So if you have roommate
problems, why won't you lis
ten to the one right next to
you?

I live in Synergy. I have 5 room
mates. We live between 2
rooms on separate floors, and
hold tenuous reign over a tiny
third, which we use as a projector
room (only holds a couch and a cof
fee table). We sleep in the double
sized room and live in the triple.
Two of my roommates snore loudly.
One of these boys' closets is direct
ly next to my desk, and wet neo
prene is no friend of mine. All five
of my roommates lack the stom
achs for a vegetarian house and
their insides complain loudly and
regularly. This is a story of clan
destine aggression, brotherhood
and guilt. This is also an apology.
The way the room setup is es
tablished at Synergy and
reestablished every quarter —is
by a loud, mimosa-fueled, uneasily
polite meeting at 9:00 sharp the
Sunday morning before classes. It
was the beginning of Winter Quar
ter, and in order to lock down our
double-triple setup for the second
quarter in a row, we needed to take
on a fifth. Attempts to finagle some
of the notorious chill bros out of
their comfy doubles fell flat:
"Um, yeah, I'll get back to you."
"Oh hey, that sounds cool! I just
wanted to check with Andrew and
see if he had a roommate yet."
"I haven't seen Kevin, but I'm
pretty sure he wants to live with
Jon."
Or, of course, the ever-dreaded
"Thanks but I'm good."
Our seemingly permanent quad
was just about out of hope when a
too-excited dormmate popped out
of nowhere. "Hey guys! I heard
you're looking for a sixth. Mark
doesn't get here until Tuesday but
I'm his proxy and he said he'd be
down for anything. What do you
guys think?"

Before I could voice my suspi
cion at (1) an emotion experienced
at a rooming meeting that was any
thing other than thinly veiled panic
and (2) the fact that a boy with
bags under his eyes was trying to
pawn off the kid on his bottom
bunk, my roommate jumped in,
"Yeah, we'd love to have him!"
We went about the following
cheery move-in days in delusion
until Tuesday night/Wednesday
morning. Then, we 11... I'll just de
scribe it for you.
1:37 A.M. I wake up from dying
in a deafening plane crash. A jet
engine's got nothing on apnea.
1:59 A.M. I fashion makeshift
ear muffs out of my two pillows. I
think as loudly as I can.
2:40 A.M. A lawn mower runs
over a cheese grater, or something
like that.
4:02 A.M. I start writing these
times down so I can angrily show
him his problem in the morning.
7:30 A.M. I wake up hours be
fore my alarm (but hours after I
could hit snooze in the daylight) to
a tractor going through the wall.
It wasn't long before my room
mates did what we could in re
sponse to this nasal nightmare
make fun of him. Don't get me
wrong: We made it clear from the
get-go that he could shatter a wine
glass at close range with his REM.
But none of us had the decency or
communication skills to tell him
that it was giving us all red alerts.
Before one fateful night shortly be
fore Spring Break, we were one
quip shy of a burn book.
While procrastinating yester
day afternoon, I struck up a con
versation with Mark's girlfriend's
roommate. It was garden variety
banter and schadenfreude
until she brought up how
she had kicked Mark to the
curb a week previous for,
yes, snoring. That intel real
ly ground my gears: We
weren't telling him how loud
he was, but here was solid
evidence that he knew and
simply didn't care. The fact
that he still slept with us
was just gross negligence.
I spoke to him later with
blazing conviction: "Mark!
uh, hey, how's your day?"
Trying to disguise the inter
vention as dinner conversa
tion, I continued, "I just
wanted to let you know that
there have been some
anonymous complaints
about your snoring. I think
you might just have to move
out. Didn't you say you used
