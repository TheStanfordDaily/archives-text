# FROM THE OPINIONS DESK
## Admission rates and why we're here 
### Winston Shi 
I don't even know how people get
into Stanford anymore. This is
an honest sentiment. The first
thing people told us during fresh
men orientation was that we were
not mistakes: that we had been ad
mitted to this exclusive club be
cause we deserved to be there. It
was very self-affirming. I enjoyed
it. It made me feel good.
And yet that sentiment, while
true, doesn't tell the whole truth.
We got into Stanford because we
deserved to be there? Sure, I won't
disagree with that. I see people do
great things constantly. You know
all the stories of success; most true,
a few perhaps contrived.
The fact of the matter is: we de
served to get in here, but most peo
ple who got rejected did too.

Is it a little silly to think of Stan
ford in terms of numbers? We're not
a data set. And yet here's a few im
portant numbers for you to consid
er: The incoming freshmen of the
2013-4 year had a 25-75 percentile
spread on the SAT of 2070-2350.
But in the 2006-7 school year the
year after the SAT added the writ
ing section the spread was 2000-
2300. And this increase has been
fairly recent: Only five years ago
the spread was still 2010-2300.
What do these numbers tell you?
We can say that the students are
performing better on standardized
tests, and though many criticisms of
the SAT are justified, the test is still
better than no test at all. For those
of you who believe that we students
deserve to be here, these numbers
should make you feel a lot better.
The idea of "deserving" is nebulous,
and justifiably so, but if our test
scores are trending up, at the very
least it looks like we are changing
the definition of what "deserving"
means.
But why is this happening? Let's
look at that change in a different
way As we've all heard, admissions
rates are consistently declining.
The graduating class of 2014 had an
admission rate of 7.2 percent. Since
then the rates have been 7.1,6.6,5.7
and now 5.07. That last figure is the
lowest in the country.
These are all small percentages,
of course. But an admissions rate of
7.2 percent translates to one out of
14. 5.07 percent means one out of
20. Just by going back to the class of
2015, in two years the selectivity of
Stanford has increased by a third.

But while our students are im
proving on standardized tests,
these rates are primarily because of
an ever-expanding applicant pool.
Over the same timeframe of the list
ed admit rates, Stanford's applicant
pool was approximately 32,000,
34,000, 37,000, 39,000 and now
42,000. At the same time, we know
that the vast majority of applicants
are qualified to attend Stanford, or
any of its peers for that matter.
(Harvard quotes the figure at 80
percent, for example.) College ad
missions have always been a buy
er's market, but recent trends show
that this tendency is increasing.
These results present an oxy
moron. The first point is that if you
can pick from a bigger pool you'll
get higher scores and theoreti
cally more qualified admits. The
second is that a lot of people who
Stanford would have considered
perfectly good candidates in the
past are now being rejected. The
admissions pool is not being inflated
by long shots who add Stanford on
the Common Application for the
hell of it. The pool is good and it's
getting better. We're still rejecting
valedictorians and team captains
and future presidents and Nobel
laureates. We're simply rejecting
more of them.

Stanford's rapidly increasing ap
plicant pools are not an isolated ex
perience: They represent larger
trends in college admissions. More
people are applying to Stanford
than ever before, and while it's
tempting to say that these appli
cants are because of the increased
visibility of the University for ex
ample, Stanford has an elite football
team while the Ivy League schools
don't that thesis is simply not
true. Admissions rates have been
declining across the board. And
asking whether Stanford has any
thing to distinguish itself from its
peers raises the question of
whether Stanford has anything to
distinguish itself at all.
Criticisms of college generally
fall into two categories. The first
that of people like Malcolm Glad
well is that a top-flight education
doesn't really help: that a person
who is admitted to both Penn State
and UPenn will do just as well in life
if he attends either school. The sec
ond which is more of a corollary
than a separate critique is that of
Peter Thiel, who famously contend-

Ed on Stanford's campus that the
only actual selling point of Stanford
is its exclusivity. And it naturally
follows that if the basic underlying
premise of university exclusivity
that schools like Stanford make the
exclusive different from the exclud
ed is false, then the exclusivity of
schools like Stanford is bound to
collapse.
So the question is: What is the
point of Stanford?
I won't try to defend Stanford in
terms of its actual education right
now. To be clear, I firmly believe
that the opportunities Stanford has
given me are difficult if not impossi
ble to replicate. I love this Universi
ty, and if I had the chance to do it all
over again, I would attend Stanford
all the same. But I don't have any
firsthand experience of the educa
tional opportunities available at oth
er schools. I can't defend my belief
as rigorously as I would like.
But we can see that the expand
ing applicant pools at schools like
Stanford belie the growing national
and international stature of these
schools. Improving transportation,
communication and financial aid re
sources at Stanford and its peers
are slowly eroding the regional na
ture of higher education, in the
same way that a few colleges are
creating a national consensus on
what school is the "best."
This is not to say that under
graduate admissions are not com
pletely national: While admit yield
(the percentage of admitted stu
dents who eventually matriculate at
the school) is normally dominated
by the national schools you would
expect, a list of high-yield schools
still features many flagship state
universities, such as Alaska-Fair
banks and Nebraska. But despite
the continued prominence of re
gional schools, the portability of a
Stanford degree is more apparent
than ever.
Does portability transcend utili
ty? I would like to think so: More
over, I would like to think that a
Stanford degree will open any door
and get me any job. But a constant
ly looming sense of uncertainty
seems to hang over every student in
the humanities, and many students
in the less marketable STEM fields
too. As a humanities student, I
think that feeling's mostly angst.
But if it's angst, it's angst that the
rest of the country feels as
well.

Universities are improv
ing their infrastructure in at
tempts to market them
selves to a student body that
is theoretically more and
more choosy. Stanford is
constantly renovating; Har
vard is pouring a small for
tune into effectively rebuild
ing its aging Houses; Yale's
undergraduate colleges are
undergoing similarly neces
sary upgrades; Chicago's
marketing efforts are a story
in and of themselves. As stu
dents, we are constantly
tempted to tell ourselves
that we are special and, un

like all others, deserve to be
here and every dollar
spent in the arms race be
tween great colleges seem
ingly reaffirms that senti
ment.
Universities have excel
lent reasons to care more
and more about marketing;
consider cross-admit yields
and the graduate student
community, each of which
deserves an essay all to it
self. But these distant strug
gles are mostly unseen by us
undergraduates, and they
do not reflect what happens
in our daily lives. As soon as
we step onto this campus as
students of this University,
what affects our lives is not
the admissions office but the
world that that office opened
to us.
What we inevitably see in
our own personal experi
ences is not affirmation of

our status at Stanford so
much as a lesson that we are
lucky to be here more
over, a reminder that we
need the University more
than it needs us. We de
served to get in here, but
most people who got reject
ed did too. But the flip side
of that truth is that Stanford
could toss out its first batch
of admits, pick a new group,
toss that one out as well, re
peat the process four or five
times, and still be the great
university that it is today.
What is left to us, then, is
to take advantage of what we
have been so utterly fortu
nate to gain. My congratula
tions to the Class of 2018:
There's a big world within
Campus Drive, and now it's
your privilege to be here.
