### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
After inopportunely dropping
two of its three games to USC to
open Pac-12 play last weekend,
Stanford's baseball team did not
get a break as it welcomed the con
ference leaders, No. 8 Oregon, to
Sunken Diamond. Despite a dis
mal 3-9 record against the Ducks
(19-8,6-3 Pac-12) over the last four
seasons, the Cardinal (10-11, 3-3)
captured its second series victory

of the season, sweeping a double
header on Friday by scores of 6-3
and 2-1 but failing to complete the
series sweep with a 9-2 loss on
Sunday.

After Saturday's game was
rescheduled due to rain in the fore
cast, the two teams played a

marathon 20 innings of baseball
over five hours and 57 minutes in a
doubleheader on Friday. Dominant
starting pitching from Stanford,
which has emerged as a strength
over the last month despite the
team's youth, as well as sound de
fense and effective small ball, ce
mented the Cardinal victories.
Stanford's contingent of fresh
man starters has combined for a
1.61 ERA over its last 11 games,
and Opening Day starter Cal
Quantrill's progression has ce

mented the rotation. Quantrill
owns a 0.89 ERA, averaging 7.4
K/9 and 3.57 K/BB over his last
five starts, after a 13.50 ERA over
his first two starts.
"The series win is huge,"
Quantrill said. "We really should
have had USC in the first [confer
ence] series, but it's not the end of
the world: you win some, you lose
some. It was big that we came
back out and proved that we were
in this. We've got a young team, so
this is a good start to getting on a
roll."
The Cardinal have also strung
together a season-long four con
secutive errorless games, and have
continued to use sacrifices to ad
vance runners when hits are at a
premium.
"It's about producing runs
when you're not hitting," said jun
ior outfielder Austin Slater. "We
struggled with it at the beginning
of the year, but we're getting bet
ter at it. We're not always going to
hit and we know that, so defense
and pitching is going to keep us in
every game. If we do those aspects
of the game well, we'll be in every
game."
In game one, Stanford jumped
out to a quick lead after the offense
rallied for three runs in the first in
ning before recording a single out.
Sophomore outfielder Zach Hoff
pauir, who went 4-for-8 with a dou
ble and an RBI in the Friday dou
bleheader, had an RBI single in
the inning. He is hitting 5-for-12
with runners in scoring position so
far this season. Freshman outfield
er Alex Dunlap added an RBI sin
gle of his own in the first, en route
to a 3-for-10 series in which he
homered and tallied three RBIs.
The Cardinal didn't surrender
its lead for the rest of the game, as
freshman pitcher Brett Hanewich
had a quality start, allowing just
three runs over six innings.
Hanewich was backed up by three
more runs all coming with two
outs and 11 total hits, Stan
ford's most since the team's March
4 game against Cal.
Game two was a pitcher's duel,

as each team's starting pitcher
lasted seven innings and allowed
just one run. Quantrill allowed just
six hits and no walks while striking
out eight in his seventh start of the
year.
"His fastball was down, his
change and breaking ball were con
sistent and he threw a lot of
strikes," said head coach Mark
Marquess. "Even through the
shutout [against Kansas on March
9th] was great, Friday's start, con
sidering the opponent, was his best
outing of the year."
Though the Cardinal only had
two hits in the 11-inning affair, both
of its runs came after a hitter
reached base and was advanced by
two sacrifice hits. (Stanford had six
total sacrifices in the game.) A sac
rifice fly from freshman second

baseman Tommy Edman in the
bottom of the eleventh plated Hoff
pauir and clinched the series for
Stanford.
An attempt to complete the
sweep on Sunday fell short after
the Ducks broke open the game
early with a seven-run second in
ning and maintained the lead for
the rest of the game. Freshman
pitcher Chris Viall was pulled after
allowing four runs over 1.1 innings
his shortest outing of the sea
son.
For a young team entering a
Pac-12 season where it will face
some of the top teams in the coun
try, a series win against a top-10
squad is sure to boost confidence.
Stanford hopes to carry the mo
mentum from this series into its
second matchup at Cal on Tuesday
night and later to its first road trip
of the season at Oregon State next
weekend.

change and breaking ball were con
sistent and he threw a lot of
strikes," said head coach Mark
Marquess. "Even through the
shutout [against Kansas on March
9th] was great, Friday's start, con
sidering the opponent, was his best
outing of the year."
Though the Cardinal only had
two hits in the 11-inning affair, both
of its runs came after a hitter
reached base and was advanced by
two sacrifice hits. (Stanford had six
total sacrifices in the game.) A sac
rifice fly from freshman second

baseman Tommy Edman in the
bottom of the eleventh plated Hoff
pauir and clinched the series for
Stanford.
An attempt to complete the
sweep on Sunday fell short after
the Ducks broke open the game
early with a seven-run second in
ning and maintained the lead for
the rest of the game. Freshman
pitcher Chris Viall was pulled after
allowing four runs over 1.1 innings
his shortest outing of the sea
son.
For a young team entering a
Pac-12 season where it will face
some of the top teams in the coun
try, a series win against a top-10
squad is sure to boost confidence.
Stanford hopes to carry the mo
mentum from this series into its
second matchup at Cal on Tuesday
night and later to its first road trip
of the season at Oregon State next
weekend.

After inopportunely dropping
two of its three games to USC to
open Pac-12 play last weekend,
Stanford's baseball team did not
get a break as it welcomed the con
ference leaders, No. 8 Oregon, to
Sunken Diamond. Despite a dis
mal 3-9 record against the Ducks
(19-8,6-3 Pac-12) over the last four
seasons, the Cardinal (10-11, 3-3)
captured its second series victory

of the season, sweeping a double
header on Friday by scores of 6-3
and 2-1 but failing to complete the
series sweep with a 9-2 loss on
Sunday.

After Saturday's game was
rescheduled due to rain in the fore
cast, the two teams played a

marathon 20 innings of baseball
over five hours and 57 minutes in a
doubleheader on Friday. Dominant
starting pitching from Stanford,
which has emerged as a strength
over the last month despite the
team's youth, as well as sound de
fense and effective small ball, ce
mented the Cardinal victories.
Stanford's contingent of fresh
man starters has combined for a
1.61 ERA over its last 11 games,
and Opening Day starter Cal
Quantrill's progression has ce

mented the rotation. Quantrill
owns a 0.89 ERA, averaging 7.4
K/9 and 3.57 K/BB over his last
five starts, after a 13.50 ERA over
his first two starts.
"The series win is huge,"
Quantrill said. "We really should
have had USC in the first [confer
ence] series, but it's not the end of
the world: you win some, you lose
some. It was big that we came
back out and proved that we were
in this. We've got a young team, so
this is a good start to getting on a
roll."
The Cardinal have also strung
together a season-long four con
secutive errorless games, and have
continued to use sacrifices to ad
vance runners when hits are at a
premium.
"It's about producing runs
when you're not hitting," said jun
ior outfielder Austin Slater. "We
struggled with it at the beginning
of the year, but we're getting bet
ter at it. We're not always going to
hit and we know that, so defense
and pitching is going to keep us in
every game. If we do those aspects
of the game well, we'll be in every
game."
In game one, Stanford jumped
out to a quick lead after the offense
rallied for three runs in the first in
ning before recording a single out.
Sophomore outfielder Zach Hoff
pauir, who went 4-for-8 with a dou
ble and an RBI in the Friday dou
bleheader, had an RBI single in
the inning. He is hitting 5-for-12
with runners in scoring position so
far this season. Freshman outfield
er Alex Dunlap added an RBI sin
gle of his own in the first, en route
to a 3-for-10 series in which he
homered and tallied three RBIs.
The Cardinal didn't surrender
its lead for the rest of the game, as
freshman pitcher Brett Hanewich
had a quality start, allowing just
three runs over six innings.
Hanewich was backed up by three
more runs all coming with two
outs and 11 total hits, Stan
ford's most since the team's March
4 game against Cal.
Game two was a pitcher's duel,

as each team's starting pitcher
lasted seven innings and allowed
just one run. Quantrill allowed just
six hits and no walks while striking
out eight in his seventh start of the
year.
"His fastball was down, his
change and breaking ball were con
