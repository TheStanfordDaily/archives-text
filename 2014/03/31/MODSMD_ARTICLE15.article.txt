# Card's tourney run a sign of things to come
## 
### SHAWN TUTEJA 
There's an old, overused
saying that goes, 'M good
things must come to an
end." (It was supposedly
Geoffrey Chaucer who
said this, in case anyone feels the
need to recite some of the Canter
bury Tales).
In my whole life as a sports fan,
I've always seen this statement af
firmed. As a bandwagon Lakers fan
in the early 2000s, I saw the Lak
ers' streak of three consecutive
NBA championships come to an
end. As a tennis fan in 2010,1 saw
Roger Federer's streak of 23 con
secutive grand slam semifinals
come to an end. And Thursday
night, at the FedEx Forum in Mem
phis, Tenn., I saw Stanford's run in
the NCAA tournament come to an
end in the Sweet 16.
Or did it?
In a literal sense, yes, Stanford
is out of the NCAA tournament.
However, for a program that had
not been to the Big Dance since
2008,1 think that the "good things"
are only starting to begin.
♦ ♦♦
Two years ago, Stanford ended
its season in Madison Square Gar
den by winning the NIT. For many
Cardinal basketball fans, there was
a feeling that the program was
headed in the right direction. As
such, many expected the Cardinal
to threaten to make a deep run in
the NCAA Tournament last season.
Unfortunately, as we know, the
team was eliminated in the second
round of the NIT last season, which
on paper seemed to be a regression
from the previous year.
The sentiment of disappointment
from last season seemed to carry
over into this year. Whether it was
through conversations that I over
heard during the Cardinal/White
preseason scrimmage or the pre
season exhibition against Seattle
Pacific, it seemed there was doubt
as to the direction the program was
heading in —it would take some
thing big to win back confidence in
the fan base.
Coach Johnny Dawkins and his
team truly delivered "something
big" this year.
Moreover, they did so by over
coming injuries and obstacles along
the way. To start the year, Stanford
found out redshirt senior Andy
Brown would need his fourth ACL
surgery since joining the Cardinal.
And with preseason injuries to
sophomores Rosco Allen and Chris
tian Sanders, the year was certain
ly not off to a storybook start for
the Cardinal.
As Stanford started to pick up
steam with a run to the finals of the
Progressive Legends Classic earli
er this season, news broke that sen
ior point guard and former NIT
MVP Aaron Bright would miss the
remainder of the season with a dis
located shoulder. How would the
Cardinal respond to this adversity?
The answer was that they would
overcome it, as they did throughout
the entire season.
Three out of the four times in
conference play in which Stanford

lost the first leg of a two-game road
trip, they responded with victories
in the latter game. The team began
to feed off of the road energy and
learned to play under some of the
brightest lights in all of the world
(such as the Barclays Center), and
at moments in which everyone was
expecting the "old Stanford team"
the team that conceded "bad
losses" at crucial points during the
season the Cardinal proved
everyone wrong and continued to
surge.
In fact, the team did this against
some of the best competition in the
nation. CBS Sports rated Stan
ford's schedule as the 17th toughest
in all of college basketball and
against that schedule, Stanford
posted a 19-11 regular-season
record and a 13-5 non-conference
record. Stanford went to the buzzer
with teams like Arizona and Michi
gan, and they pulled out victories
against the likes of Connecticut,
UCLA, Oregon and Arizona State.
So where is the program head
ing now?
I think it's clear that Stanford
did not just catch lightning in a bot
tle during its run to the Sweet 16.
The Cardinal showed all season
that they could play with and beat
the best, and they did it both at

Maples Pavilion and on the road.
This should be an encouraging sign
to all Stanford fans going forward,
as it is clear that Coach Dawkins is
building the groundwork for a suc
cessful team for years to come.
A large part of this groundwork
is due to the hard work and leader
ship that this year's senior class
Dwight Powell, Josh Huestis, Rob
bie Lemons, John Gage, Aaron
Bright and Andy Brown dis
played throughout their careers.
These seniors can look back on
their years on the Farm with a
sense of accomplishment. Just
think: Four years ago, Stanford fin
ished the season 15-16, without
even having earned an invitation to
the NIT. What a difference four
years can make.
At the podium following Stan
ford's loss to Dayton, senior for
ward Dwight Powell, who has
played the most games of any men's

player ever to put on a Stanford
uniform, reflected on that.
"Hopefully, the guys that won't
be with the team next year have left
a legacy, like Coach [Dawkins]
said," Powell said, "and have left a
path for those guys to follow and ex
ceed."
One of "those guys," junior
guard Chasson Randle, instead
talked about the motivating aspects
of a loss.
"It's definitely motivating,"
Randle said. "It just means we have
to work so much harder to advance
and go further next year. I'm look
ing forward to it."
And we all as fans are certainly
looking forward to next year. Stan
ford will welcome one of the na
tion's top recruiting classes. Robert
Cartwright, Michael Humphrey,
Dorian Pickens and Reid Travis will
all join the team as freshmen next
year, and starters Chasson Randle,

Stefan Nastic and Anthony Brown
will be back for the Cardinal.
In 10 years, when we talk about
the legacy of this year's team and
this run to the Sweet 16,1 think we
will all agree that this was the run
that helped Stanford turn the cor
ner in men's basketball. After all,
don't the song lyrics go something
like, "the best is yet to come"?
