# Card's tourney run a sign of things to come

### SHAWN TUTEJA 
There's an old, overused
saying that goes, 'M good
things must come to an
end." (It was supposedly
Geoffrey Chaucer who
said this, in case anyone feels the
need to recite some of the Canter
bury Tales).
In my whole life as a sports fan,
I've always seen this statement af
firmed. As a bandwagon Lakers fan
in the early 2000s, I saw the Lak
ers' streak of three consecutive
NBA championships come to an
end. As a tennis fan in 2010,1 saw
Roger Federer's streak of 23 con
secutive grand slam semifinals
come to an end. And Thursday
night, at the FedEx Forum in Mem
phis, Tenn., I saw Stanford's run in
the NCAA tournament come to an
end in the Sweet 16.
Or did it?
In a literal sense, yes, Stanford
is out of the NCAA tournament.
However, for a program that had
not been to the Big Dance since
2008,1 think that the "good things"
are only starting to begin.

Two years ago, Stanford ended
its season in Madison Square Gar
den by winning the NIT. For many
Cardinal basketball fans, there was
a feeling that the program was
headed in the right direction. As
such, many expected the Cardinal
to threaten to make a deep run in
the NCAA Tournament last season.
Unfortunately, as we know, the
team was eliminated in the second
round of the NIT last season, which
on paper seemed to be a regression
from the previous year.
The sentiment of disappointment
from last season seemed to carry
over into this year. Whether it was
through conversations that I over
heard during the Cardinal/White
preseason scrimmage or the pre
season exhibition against Seattle
Pacific, it seemed there was doubt
as to the direction the program was
heading in —it would take some
thing big to win back confidence in
