# Season ends swimmingly
## 
### GEORGE CHEN EDITOR IN CHIEF 
The Cardinal just didn't know
how to stop winning.
Momentum isn't a term that's
usually used in swimming, but it
might have been the only word
that could explain the Stanford
women's swimming and diving
squad's impressive performance
at the NCAA Championships in
Minneapolis this weekend.
Stanford won event after
event over the course of the
three-day meet, racking up seven
event titles the same number
that it won in the last four
NCAAs combined en route to
a second-place finish. Though not
many expected the Cardinal to
land in the top four, Stanford
wound up 16.5 points ahead of
third-place finisher and Pac-12
champion Cal led by Olympic
star Missy Franklin, no less
and 66.5 points above Texas

A&M. Only Georgia boasted the
depth to hold off the star-studded
Cardinal squad, as the Bulldogs
easily took the team title by a
margin of over 100 points.
In just his second year on the
Farm, head coach Greg Meehan
was named the CSCAA Swim
ming Coach of the Year for lead
ing his team to a runner-up finish
in which Stanford scored its
most points at NCAAs since 2000
and bouncing back from a
somewhat disappointing showing
at the national meet last season.
"It's pretty rewarding," Mee
han told GoStanford.com. "I
think mostly for our seniors. For
them to go out like this, with a
second-place finish and winning
four of five relays, is just special."
For the seniors, this past
weekend was about redemption
and capturing the elusive gold
medal.
Senior Maya Dißado paved
the way with four total first-place

finishes, two in individual events
and two in relays a defining
moment for Dißado, considering
that an NCAA title had eluded
her by the smallest of margins
every season since her freshman
year. Dißado swept the individual
medley events, first chasing
down Georgia's Melanie Margalis
in the final lap of the 200 individ
ual medley and then beating out
Olympian and defending champi
on Elizabeth Beisel in the 400 in
dividual medley.
Senior Felicia Lee also cap
tured her first NCAA title, win
ning the 100 butterfly, 200
freestyle relay, 400 medley relay
and the 400 freestyle relay in ad
dition to taking third in the 100
backstroke. In the 100 butterfly,
Lee was sixth at the halfway
mark, but exploded off the last
two turns to touch the wall first
with a time of 50.89. The senior

and 400-yard individual medley events and swimming in two winning relays.
