# Opening Day excitement is contagious
## 
### Michael Peterson 
It's only fitting that the start of
spring quarter here on cam
pus coincides with Opening
Day for Major League Base
ball.
Today, everybody begins with a
clean slate. For Stanford students,
grades from last quarter good or
bad are forgotten and new classes
begin. For baseball teams, last year's
records fade and each team stands
tied for first place at 0-0 (discounting
the Dodgers and Diamondbacks,
who played two games in Australia
last week).
More so than in other quarters
for students, spring brings an excite
ment and a hope for a prosperous
quarter filled with sun, beach trips
and lighter workloads.
Similarly, on Opening Day, every
team believes that it could make the
postseason or win the World Series,
with maybe 10 or 12 teams having re
alistic hopes. At least on Opening
Day, it's not hard to envision a sce
nario for every team that ends in the
postseason even the Houston As
tros. If Mark Appel reaches the ma
jors and notches 15 wins, Jose Altuve
hits .340 and prospect Jonathan Sin
gleton slugs 35 home runs in an in
jury-riddled AL West Division, the
Astros could threaten for the division
crown or a Wild Card spot.
Yes, those situations will likely
sound crazy in a couple of weeks, but
on Opening Day, even Astros fans
can have hope. Few people outside of
the New England area thought a
Boston Red Sox team coming off a
69-93 season would challenge for a
playoff spot last year, and now they
reign as defending World Series
champions.
For some, Opening Day will be
the high point of the season a
weak middle of the order, a lack of
elite pitching or a season-ending in
jury to a star player might doom a
team in just the first few weeks.
Even as a student, the first problem
set might be a sign of a difficult quar
ter ahead and the first day of the
quarter, hopefully homework-free,
might have been the best.
For others, the first day is the
start of better things to come. Ten
teams will make the postseason and
one team will take home the trophy.
Students will likely enjoy an exciting
quarter in the beautiful northern
California weather.
Beyond the comparison with
spring quarter at Stanford, baseball's
Opening Day really the premier
opening day of any sport is unlike
any other day of the season. An en
tire season filled with mystery
awaits.
With the first games underway,
we can only wonder what's in store
for the new MLB season. Will Mike
Trout surpass Miguel Cabrera and
win his first AL MVP award? Can
the Red Sox repeat as champions?
Will the Dodgers' mammoth payroll
deliver them their first World Series
title since 1988?
The new season ushers in some
what of a changing of the guard.
Gone are the days when Alex Ro
driguez, Albert Pujols, Josh Hamil
ton, Ichiro Suzuki and Derek Jeter
would lead the league in home runs,
hits, batting average or RBIs. In
stead, relatively new names like Paul
Goldschmidt, Andrew McCutchen,
Bryce Harper and Mike Trout head
line the list of MVP candidates, along
with mainstays Miguel Cabrera and
Robinson Cano. Baseball is becoming
a younger man's game. In fact, the
average age of an MLB player has
decreased in seven of the last nine
years and is now about a year
younger (28.5) than it was in 2006.
However, the downward trend in
age has yet to spread to the postsea
son. Last year's champion, the
Boston Red Sox, still had an average
age of 30 years old and was among
the top five oldest teams in the
league. In 2012, the San Francisco Gi
ants won the World Series with an av
erage age of 29 years and in 2011, the
St. Louis Cardinals won with an av
erage age of 30 years. Both of these
teams were also in the upper half of
teams in the league in age.
At some point, though, youth will
prevail. I think that time is now
this will finally be the year that a
team highlighted by youth wins the
World Series. When the World Series
concludes in October, the Washington
Nationals, led by 21-year-old out
fielder Bryce Harper and 25-year-old
ace Stephen Strasburg, will finish as
the champions of baseball.
That being said, the Nationals
