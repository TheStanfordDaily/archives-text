### â€“ Do-Hymmg Park 
The No. 13 Cardinal lacrosse
team extended its winning streak
to six games and boosted its record
to 8-1 with a come-from-behind vic
tory over No. 6 Notre Dame (8-4)
on Saturday.
Sophomore midfielder Lucy
Dikeou led the charge for Stanford
with her four goals on five shots and
ultimately provided the match-win
ning goal with 4:05 remaining in the
second period to push the Cardinal
ahead to the final score of 11-10.
"They're fighters," said Stan
ford coach Amy Bokker to GoStan
ford.com. "They go down swinging
every time they step on the field."
Although the Fighting Irish led
by three at the half, the Cardinal

out-shot Notre Dame 11-6 in the
second period and limited their
turnovers as they scored four con
secutive goals in eight minutes to
turn a 9-6 deficit into a 10-9 advan
tage. Freshman attacker Kelsey
Murray scored two of those goals as
she and her .684 continue to lead the
starters in shot percentage.
With the victory over the Irish,
Stanford earned a victory against
its highest-ranked competition of
the season and is enjoying its
strongest start to a season since
2011, when the Cardinal ultimately
lost in the first round of the NCAA
Tournament after starting the sea
son 8-1.
The Cardinal will next host Den
ver and Colorado on Friday and
Sunday, respectively.
