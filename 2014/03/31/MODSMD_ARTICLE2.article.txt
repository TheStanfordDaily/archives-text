Speaking to Peking University
Wang Enge, President of Peking University, welcomed
Obama with a speech explaining how study abroad can serve
as a tool for international cooperation.
"It takes a village to educate a young generation of lead
ers. Let's work together," Enge said.
Max Baucus '64 J.D. '67, the United States Ambassador to
China, said his experience studying abroad during his time at
Stanford helped him find "his calling" in the foreign service.
"Taste the food, talk to people, learn about the culture,
struggle with the language," he urged students. "The more
we study overseas and learn what's happening in other coun
tries, the more interconnected and more lively [the world]
will be."
Obama emphasized cross-cultural connections, particular
