# Obama visits Beijing campus
## First Lady talks international education, citizen diplomacy 
### MADELEINE HAN KYLIE JUE 
Earlier this month, First Lady Michelle Obama telecon
ferenced with Stanford students, local high school students
and students studying in China to discuss international edu
cation and studying abroad. The conference took place dur
ing Obama's visit to Peking University.
Speaking to Peking University
Wang Enge, President of Peking University, welcomed
Obama with a speech explaining how study abroad can serve
as a tool for international cooperation.
"It takes a village to educate a young generation of lead
ers. Let's work together," Enge said.
Max Baucus '64 J.D. '67, the United States Ambassador to
China, said his experience studying abroad during his time at
Stanford helped him find "his calling" in the foreign service.
"Taste the food, talk to people, learn about the culture,
struggle with the language," he urged students. "The more
we study overseas and learn what's happening in other coun
tries, the more interconnected and more lively [the world]
will be."
Obama emphasized cross-cultural connections, particular
ly between students in the United States and China. She cit
ed the national 100,000 Strong Educational Exchange initia
tive, which President Obama announced during his visit to
China in 2009.

First Lady Michelle Obama paid a visit to the Stanford Center at Peking University
on March 21, participating in an international teleconference with students
in China and the U.S. about international education and studying abroad.
"We believe that relation
ships between nations aren't
just about relationships be
tween government or lead
ers. They're about relation
ships between people, partic
ularly young people," Obama
said. "We view study abroad
programs not just as an edu
cational opportunity for stu
dents but also as a vital part
of America's foreign policy."
The flow of U.S. students
to China, and vice versa, has
remained strong in recent
years. China is the fifth most
popular destination for
American students studying
abroad, and Chinese stu
dents make up the largest
percentage of international
students in the United
States.
Obama stressed that
studying abroad provides
students with the tools to
succeed in a global economy
and shape the world around
them. She also encouraged
students to engage in a "new
era of citizen diplomacy," ar
guing that anyone can play
the role of a diplomat.
"When it comes to the fi
nal challenges of our time,
whether it's climate change
or economic opportunity or
the spread of nuclear
weapons, these are shared
challenges," Obama said.
"And no one country can con
front them alone. The only
way forward is together."
Technology enabling citi
zen diplomacy
Obama explained that
technological development
has enabled citizen diploma
cy via the Internet and on
line media.

"Through the wonders of
modern technology, our
world is more connected
than ever before," Obama
said. "Ideas can cross oceans
with a click of a button, com
panies can do business and
compete with companies
across the globe."
She also explained that
the Obama administration
supports giving everyone
the freedom to access infor
mation online in order to
"discover the truth."
"That's how we learn
what's really happening in
our communities and in our
country and in our world,"
Obama said. "That's how we
decide which values and
ideas we think are best by
questioning and debating
them vigorously, by listening
to all sides of an argument,
and by judging for our
selves."
"As my husband has said,
we respect the uniqueness of
other cultures and societies,"
she added, "but when it
comes to expressing yourself
freely and worshipping as
you choose and having open
access to information, we be
lieve those are universal
rights that are the birthright
of every person on this plan
et."
Discussing citizen diplo
macy
Following her speech,
Obama discussed interna
tional education with stu
dents using the Highly Im
mersive Classrooms (HIC)
at Stanford's Graduate
School of Business (GSB)
and the Stanford Center at
Peking University (SCPKU).
"The format that we have
here is incredibly unique,"
Obama said about the cross-
HIC discussion. "It high
lights the importance the
role of technology plays in

opening up communities and
cultures to one another."
In Beijing, Peking Uni
versity students and Ameri
cans studying abroad in Chi
na joined Obama. Attendees
at Stanford included under
graduates and Ph.D. stu
dents contacted for their af
filiation with the Freeman
Spogli Institute of Interna
tional Studies (FSI), stu
dents from the GSB and
high school students from
Bay Area schools.
"Study abroad shouldn't
just be for students from
certain backgrounds," Oba
ma said. "Our hope is to
build connections between
people of all races and so
cioeconomic backgrounds
because it is that diversity
that truly will change the
face of our relationships. We
believe that diversity makes
our country vibrant and
strong, and our study abroad
programs should reflect the
true spirit of America to the
world."
The conversation opened
with a discussion about the
importance of studying
abroad for each of the stu
dents in attendance. Maddy
Sides 'l4, who has traveled
to France and Guatemala,
said that she had found that
working in a foreign context
was enriching at any age.
"Now that I've had that
experience studying abroad,
I've realized that that's what
I want to do in my profes
sional life," Sides said.
Obama emphasized that
fear should not hold anyone
back, calling studying
abroad the "first step to
overcoming the fear of mak
ing mistakes."
"One thing that is impor
tant to consider is not letting
fear be your guide, and
that's oftentimes what holds
many young people back

from doing fabulous things,"
Obama explained. "[Parents]
want you to be safe, but life
is about making mistakes."

Obama called the stu
dents the United States'
"greatest ambassadors" and
emphasized the importance
of educating this generation
in foreign languages. She
added, however, that ex
panding foreign language
studies will take resources.
"We have to find the re
sources, and we have to en
gage our private sector as
well understand if they're
going to have the employees
of the future who can oper
ate in a global environment,"
Obama said.
At the end of the video
conference, Adam Liu, a po
litical science doctoral stu
dent at Stanford, summa
rized the discussion by ex
plaining the importance of
understanding different cul
tures.
"We have all sorts of fan
cy models about why crises
in international relations ex
ist, but at the end of the day,
all conversations boil down
to a lack of understanding,"
Liu said. "This conversation
speaks to the need of having
more and deeper conversa
tions between countries in
the world."
Moderator Mariano-Flo
rentino Cuellar M.A. '96
Ph.D. 'OO, director of FSI,
added a last word about
cross-cultural understand
ing.
"Building that under
standing doesn't just help us
avoid crises," Cuellar said,
"but probably helps us un
derstand ourselves better as
well."

of America's foreign policy."
The flow of U.S. students
to China, and vice versa, has
remained strong in recent
years. China is the fifth most
popular destination for
American students studying
abroad, and Chinese stu
dents make up the largest
percentage of international
students in the United
States.
Obama stressed that
studying abroad provides
students with the tools to
succeed in a global economy
and shape the world around
them. She also encouraged
students to engage in a "new
era of citizen diplomacy," ar
guing that anyone can play
the role of a diplomat.
"When it comes to the fi
nal challenges of our time,
whether it's climate change
or economic opportunity or
the spread of nuclear
weapons, these are shared
challenges," Obama said.
"And no one country can con
front them alone. The only
way forward is together."
Technology enabling citi
zen diplomacy
Obama explained that
technological development
has enabled citizen diploma
cy via the Internet and on
line media.

"Through the wonders of
modern technology, our
world is more connected
than ever before," Obama
said. "Ideas can cross oceans
with a click of a button, com
panies can do business and
compete with companies
across the globe."
She also explained that
the Obama administration
supports giving everyone
the freedom to access infor
mation online in order to
"discover the truth."
"That's how we learn
what's really happening in
our communities and in our
country and in our world,"
Obama said. "That's how we
decide which values and
ideas we think are best by
questioning and debating
them vigorously, by listening
to all sides of an argument,
and by judging for our
selves."
"As my husband has said,
we respect the uniqueness of
other cultures and societies,"
she added, "but when it
comes to expressing yourself
freely and worshipping as
you choose and having open
access to information, we be
lieve those are universal
rights that are the birthright
of every person on this plan
et."
Discussing citizen diplo
macy
Following her speech,
Obama discussed interna
tional education with stu
dents using the Highly Im
mersive Classrooms (HIC)
at Stanford's Graduate
School of Business (GSB)
and the Stanford Center at
Peking University (SCPKU).
"The format that we have
here is incredibly unique,"
Obama said about the cross-
HIC discussion. "It high
lights the importance the
role of technology plays in

opening up communities and
cultures to one another."
In Beijing, Peking Uni
versity students and Ameri
cans studying abroad in Chi
na joined Obama. Attendees
at Stanford included under
graduates and Ph.D. stu
dents contacted for their af
filiation with the Freeman
Spogli Institute of Interna
tional Studies (FSI), stu
dents from the GSB and
high school students from
Bay Area schools.
"Study abroad shouldn't
just be for students from
certain backgrounds," Oba
ma said. "Our hope is to
build connections between
people of all races and so
cioeconomic backgrounds
because it is that diversity
that truly will change the
face of our relationships. We
believe that diversity makes
our country vibrant and
strong, and our study abroad
programs should reflect the
true spirit of America to the
world."
The conversation opened
with a discussion about the
importance of studying
abroad for each of the stu
dents in attendance. Maddy
Sides 'l4, who has traveled
to France and Guatemala,
said that she had found that
working in a foreign context
was enriching at any age.
"Now that I've had that
experience studying abroad,
I've realized that that's what
I want to do in my profes
sional life," Sides said.
Obama emphasized that
fear should not hold anyone
back, calling studying
abroad the "first step to
overcoming the fear of mak
ing mistakes."
"One thing that is impor
tant to consider is not letting
fear be your guide, and
that's oftentimes what holds
many young people back

from doing fabulous things,"
Obama explained. "[Parents]
want you to be safe, but life
is about making mistakes."

Obama called the stu
dents the United States'
"greatest ambassadors" and
emphasized the importance
of educating this generation
in foreign languages. She
added, however, that ex
panding foreign language
studies will take resources.
"We have to find the re
sources, and we have to en
gage our private sector as
well understand if they're
going to have the employees
of the future who can oper
ate in a global environment,"
Obama said.
At the end of the video
conference, Adam Liu, a po
litical science doctoral stu
dent at Stanford, summa
rized the discussion by ex
plaining the importance of
understanding different cul
tures.
"We have all sorts of fan
cy models about why crises
in international relations ex
ist, but at the end of the day,
all conversations boil down
to a lack of understanding,"
Liu said. "This conversation
speaks to the need of having
more and deeper conversa
tions between countries in
the world."
Moderator Mariano-Flo
rentino Cuellar M.A. '96
Ph.D. 'OO, director of FSI,
added a last word about
cross-cultural understand
ing.
"Building that under
standing doesn't just help us
avoid crises," Cuellar said,
"but probably helps us un
derstand ourselves better as
well."

Earlier this month, First Lady Michelle Obama telecon
ferenced with Stanford students, local high school students
and students studying in China to discuss international edu
cation and studying abroad. The conference took place dur
ing Obama's visit to Peking University.
Speaking to Peking University
Wang Enge, President of Peking University, welcomed
Obama with a speech explaining how study abroad can serve
as a tool for international cooperation.
"It takes a village to educate a young generation of lead
ers. Let's work together," Enge said.
Max Baucus '64 J.D. '67, the United States Ambassador to
China, said his experience studying abroad during his time at
Stanford helped him find "his calling" in the foreign service.
"Taste the food, talk to people, learn about the culture,
struggle with the language," he urged students. "The more
we study overseas and learn what's happening in other coun
tries, the more interconnected and more lively [the world]
will be."
Obama emphasized cross-cultural connections, particular
ly between students in the United States and China. She cit
ed the national 100,000 Strong Educational Exchange initia
tive, which President Obama announced during his visit to
China in 2009.
