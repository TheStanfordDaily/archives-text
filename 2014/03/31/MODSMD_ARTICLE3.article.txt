### ALEX ZIVKOVIC DESK EDITOR 
Stanford admitted 2,138 stu
dents to the Class of 2018 in this
year's admissions cycle, producing
at 5.07 percent the lowest ad
mit rate in University history.
The University received a total
of 42,167 applications this year, a
record total and an 8.6 percent in
crease over last year's figure of
38,828. Stanford accepted 748 stu
dents in December through the Of
fice of Undergraduate Admission's
restrictive early action program
and extended offers to 1,390 more
applicants on March 28. A further
958 students have been placed on
the waitlist.
Director of Undergraduate Ad
mission Colleen Lim M.A. 'BO at
tributed the decrease in the num
ber of offers extended compared to
previous years to a higher yield
rate, which Lim described as
having risen more than 5
percent over the past four
years.
"Stanford's reputation of
excellence around the globe
has most certainly impacted
our application numbers,"

Lim said. "As an example,
on Wednesday, March 26,
we posted a blog on our ad
mission page to announce
our decision release date
in less than two days, the
admissions blog has been
visited by 9,166 people from
116 countries and all 50
states."
Dean of Admission and
Financial Aid Richard Shaw
emphasized the uniqueness
of the incoming class, which

features students from 50
states and 71 countries.
"Of course the beauty of
these young people is that
they truly represent the
broad and deep diversity of
the world," Shaw said.
This year's admit rate
continues a trend of increas
ing selectivity in the Univer
sity's admissions process.
The University extended of
fers to 5.7 percent of appli
cants in 2013, 6.6 percent in
2012 and 7.1 percent in 2011.
A number of peer institu
tions also announced histori

cally low admit rates for the
Class of 2018, as Yale,
Princeton, the University of
Pennsylvania and Cornell re
ported figures of 6.3, 7.3, 9.9
and 14 percent respectively.
Meanwhile, Harvard and
Columbia reported slightly
increased acceptance rates
of 5.9 and 6.9 percent respec
tively.
Admitted students have
until May 1 to accept the
University's offer.
