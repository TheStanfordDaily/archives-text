# ROAD TO THE SWEET 16
## WOMEN'S FINAL FOUR HOPES CONTINUE 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
The No. 2 seed Stanford women's bas
ketball team advanced to the Elite Eight
after dismantling No. 3 Penn State 82-57
on Sunday. After starting out sluggishly in

its last two games of the NCAA Tourna
ment, Stanford didn't let Penn State start
with any momentum and led for the ma
jority of the game as it cruised to a romp
of the Nittany Lions.
"I think today was an ideal day for
Stanford basketball," said senior forward
Chiney Ogwumike. "I think we had so
many contributions. I'm looking at de
fense, looking at offense, and I told my
team, you guys, we are great players col
lectively and individually. I want to be an
afterthought. I want people to be aggres
sive, and I think that's what we saw. Hav
ing that aggressive mindset, and that's
what Coach Tara [VanDerveer] said, one
of our big goals for the game was have the
aggressive mindset. We know they have

Stanford women's basketball, led by senior All-American Chiney Ogwumike (left)
and her 25 points and 15 rebounds, will next play North Carolina in the Elite Eight
of the NCAA Tournament at Maples Pavilion on Tuesday after beating Penn State.



the size advantage, but we want to
have the heart advantage."
Although Ogwumike earned an
other double-double, finishing with
29 points, 15 rebounds, three as
sists, a block and two steals, it was
freshman Lili Thompson on the de
fensive end who keyed the win.
Thompson was set with the task
of containing senior guard Maggie
Lucas, an aggressive player who
approaches each game with a pow
erful emotional intensity and aver
ages 21.5 points per game. Thomp
son, however, only allowed Lucas to
notch six points in total, holding the
Lady Lions' leading scorer to her
lowest output of the season
first-seeded Notre Dame was the
only other team to hold her to un
der 10 points this year. Thompson
herself finished with 11 points and
three assists.
"Coach [VanDerveer] provided
me with a lot of film to watch on
[Lucas], and I kind of studied her
game and just decided that I want
ed to shut her down and make oth
er people score for them, and that
would be the best way I could con
tribute to the win," Thompson said.
"So just playing hard and trying
not to let her get as many touches
as she usually does was pretty
much my number-one plan."
Senior forward Mikaela Ruef
came through once again in taking
care of the "grunt work," as Ogwu
mike calls it: rebounding, boxing
out and finding the open players.
In her final season, Ruef has been
doing it all; she finished the game
with 11 points, 13 rebounds, five as
sists and two steals.
In addition, junior Amber Or
range had a stellar performance
with 18 points, taking much of the
pressure away from Ogwumike
down low. With four players scoring
in double digits, the Cardinal of
fense got the spread in scoring that
it has been looking for all season.
After having played in lowa to
earn the right to play on its home
court in the Sweet 16 and Elite
Eight, the team was provided a
boost in energy from an energetic
home crowd. However, the players
took the game, regardless of loca
tion, as just another opportunity to
perform on the court and advance.
"The crowd was great," Ogwu
mike said. "We love Nerd Nation,
but it comes down to doing our jobs
on the court. The energy was great,
but people in the stands can't make
the plays. So I think that's what we
focused on, just controlling what
we can control. It's nice to have
cheers behind us, but I think it just
comes down to just playing basket
ball.
Although Thompson was able to
contain Lucas, senior Ariel Ed
wards was difficult for Stanford to
contain and carried the burden of
the Lady Lions' offense, finishing
with 22 points. Size was a problem
for the Cardinal in the beginning as
both of Penn State's centers ex
ceeded 6-foot-5, but Ogwumike and
Ruef adjusted underneath the bas
ket to stifle their post play.
The Cardinal will advance to the
Elite Eight on Tuesday to take on
fourth-seeded North Carolina. The
Tar Heels upset top-seeded South
Carolina, leading the majority of
the game with their athleticism and
speed. UNC was led by freshman
Diamond DeShields and her 19
points.
The Elite Eight game of the
Stanford Regional will be on Tues
day, with tipoff at 6 p.m.
