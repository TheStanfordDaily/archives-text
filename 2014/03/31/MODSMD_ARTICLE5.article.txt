# MEN STOPPED SHORT OF ELITE EIGHT

### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
As is often the case in March, Cinderel
la's slipper fits. Unfortunately for the up
start Stanford men's basketball team, it just
fits the Dayton Flyers a little bit better.

A case of the Delta blues caught up to
Stanford in Memphis, Tenn., on Thursday
night, as the Cardinal's dream run
through the field of 68 finally came to an
end in the Sweet 16. No. 10 seed Stanford
(23-13,10-8 Pac-12) was overcome by No.
11 seed Dayton's (26-10, 10-6 Atlantic 10)
superior depth and quickness, falling 82-
72 in a game in which the Cardinal just
could never put it all together.
Though Stanford kept the game within
a few points for the first 11 minutes of the
first half, cold shooting and an inability to
contain the plethora of Dayton's offensive
weapons turned a close battle into a 10-
point advantage for the Flyers at halftime.

After stunning the nation by making it to the Sweet 16, the Stanford men's
basketball team fell to Dayton 82-72 on Thursday night. The team now loses six
seniors, including Dwight Powell (right), Stanford's all-time leader in games played.
Stefan Nastic in the post, Stanford
struggled to contain Dayton's
perimeter shooting, surrendering
six first-half 3-pointers at a 46.2
percent clip.
"I thought Dayton did a really
good job of executing their offense,
especially in the first half," said
Stanford head coach Johnny
Dawkins. "Those kids also did a
very good job of being very they
were relentless, is the best way I
could put it."
Freshman Kendall Pollard and
Ohio State transfer Jordan Sibert
led the charge for head coach
Archie Miller's Dayton team, which
reached its first Elite Eight since

1984. Pollard finished with 12
points, the first double-digit scoring
performance of his collegiate ca
reer, while Sibert tallied 18 points
and a team high four 3-pointers.
Despite the halftime deficit, the
Cardinal came out strong in the sec
ond half behind the terrific play of
interior duo Nastic and Dwight
Powell. Powell's spinning layup cut
the Flyers' lead to four with 15:53
left to play, and Nastic's two free
throws a minute later, already his
sixth and seventh points of the half,
once again trimmed Dayton's lead
back to four. The Cardinal faithful
was primed for the comeback.
Yet it was not to be for Stanford
on that night, as Pollard and Sibert
quickly responded with a layup and
a 3-pointer to push the lead back to
nine.
Powell's 3-point play with 8:10
remaining closed the gap to six, but

as was seemingly the case every
time on Thursday night, Dayton
had answers for everything Stan
ford threw at it. The Flyers re
sponded with a 3-point play of their
own on the ensuing possession, and
any momentum the Cardinal might
have had after a Huestis 3-pointer
with 6:03 to play was effectively
sucked out of FedEx Forum when
Nastic was charged with his fifth
foul. Stanford would never again
trail by single digits.
Dayton's 34-2 advantage in
bench scoring was too much to
overcome, as it seemed as though
some members of Stanford's heavi
ly relied-upon starting lineup, par
ticularly the backcourt, finally ran
out of gas. And even though the
Cardinal was finally able to estab
lish their dominance down low late
in the game on the offensive end of
the court, the smaller Flyers came

away with 10 offensive rebounds
and, with them, far too many sec
ond chances for the Cardinal to
overcome.
"We thought our advantage was
our inside play," Dawkins said. "No
matter what defense we played, we
wanted to make sure the emphasis
was to keep them out front and out
of our paint. And that's where we
fell short."
Junior Chasson Randle tallied
21 points for Stanford to cap the
fourth-best scoring season (675
points) in Stanford history, but he
wasn't pleased with his overall per
formance after shooting just 5-of-21
from the floor and committing 5
turnovers. His backcourt mate An
thony Brown was unusually quiet,
scoring just 4 points on l-of-5 shoot
ing.
The defeat ended Stanford's
deepest run in the tournament

since 2008, when the Cardinal also
bowed out in the Sweet 16.
Valiant efforts by senior co-cap
tains Dwight Powell and Josh
Huestis were not enough to prevent
the loss and, accordingly, the ends of
two brilliant careers. The duo will
finish 1-2 as the all-time leaders in
games played in a Stanford uniform.
Powell had 17 points, 9 re
bounds, 2 assists and 2 steals in his
final outing as a member of the Car
dinal, while Huestis added 13
points, 8 rebounds, 4 blocks and 3
steals as the anchor of the defense.
"First and foremost, this is very
tough for us," Powell said. "We fell
short of all of our goals, and that's
always disappointing, especially
when we're done, seniors are done.
We don't have any more games."
While all that may be true, Pow
ell and company will have nothing
to hang their heads about going in
to this offseason. A few years from
now, it is easily conceivable that
this group of players will be re
membered as the ones who
brought Stanford basketball back
to relevance.
Nerd Nation, riding the emo
tion of a pair of defensive-minded
upsets and the cowbell-toting mag
ic of a senior band member, hasn't
been this strong in a while. It has
one of the best starting lineups in
school history one that started
every game except one this year
to thank for that.
