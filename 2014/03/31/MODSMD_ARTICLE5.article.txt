# MEN STOPPED SHORT OF ELITE EIGHT

### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
As is often the case in March, Cinderel
la's slipper fits. Unfortunately for the up
start Stanford men's basketball team, it just
fits the Dayton Flyers a little bit better.

A case of the Delta blues caught up to
Stanford in Memphis, Tenn., on Thursday
night, as the Cardinal's dream run
through the field of 68 finally came to an
end in the Sweet 16. No. 10 seed Stanford
(23-13,10-8 Pac-12) was overcome by No.
11 seed Dayton's (26-10, 10-6 Atlantic 10)
superior depth and quickness, falling 82-
72 in a game in which the Cardinal just
could never put it all together.
Though Stanford kept the game within
a few points for the first 11 minutes of the
first half, cold shooting and an inability to
contain the plethora of Dayton's offensive
weapons turned a close battle into a 10-
point advantage for the Flyers at halftime.
Despite some terrific first-half play from
senior Josh Huestis and redshirt junior
