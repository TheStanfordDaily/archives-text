# Q&A ALEX CHANG LSJUMB COWBELL MAESTRO
## 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
Even as the men's basketball
team swept to an unexpected victo
ry against Kansas last Sunday, the
Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band's Alex Chang 'l4 al
so hit the headlines for his vigorous
cowbell playing on the sidelines.
Along with the many GIFs and
Vines that featured the zealous mu
sician, the Jimmy Kimmel Live!
show invited Chang to take the
stage with its band for a show.
The Daily sat down with Chang
to talk about his fifteen minutes of
fame and his thoughts on being rec
ognized as "that Stanford cowbell

kid."
The Stanford Daily (TSD): When
did you first realize you were trend
ing?
Alex Chang (AC): Probably
when I got to the hotel later that
night. I had like 50-something Face
book notifications, and I thought,
this is unusual. I'm not usually that
popular.
TSD: How did Jimmy Kimmel
reach out to you and what was that
like?
AC: I got a call from someone
from Stanford Communications say
ing that a couple of people had asked
about me and so I called them back.

It was tough, though, because that
was during the women's basketball
games [in St. Louis and Aimes], so I
had a lot of help setting that all up.
TSD: What was the experience on
the show like, representing Stan
ford, yourself or cowbell players
across the nation?
AC: It was a surreal experience.
I didn't know what to expect but I
was glad for the most part that they
had me playing cowbell with the
band. I can do that better than I can
beat [the drums] on the spot with a
live comedian. It was a lot of fun. It
was a lot of pressure because I was
nervous being live and representing
more than just myselfâ€”the band

and our school and everything. But I
was pretty happy with the way it
went. It's a great story that I'll be
able to tell my kids and grandkids
and so on.
TSD: Aside from all the Internet
fame and the Kimmel show, where
else has the cowbell taken you?
AC: I think that's pretty much it.
I did an interview with the Washing
ton Post the day that we played Day
ton in the Sweet Sixteen. But other
than that, life has returned to nor
mal, which I'm not at all disappoint
ed about. I've enjoyed [the fame]
completely but it's nice to know that
