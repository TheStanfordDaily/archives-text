## Researchers develop paper microscope 
### SKYLAR COHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A team of Stanford researchers
has developed an ultra-low cost pa
per microscope that offers the poten
tial for more effective disease diagno
sis in developing regions.
According to Assistant Professor
of Bioengineering Manu Prakash,
the Foldscope was inspired by meth
ods of mass production that Prakash
witnessed while traveling in India
and Thailand. Prakash subsequently
applied that concept of scalability to
meeting the challenges of diseases he
had encountered in Africa.
Each Foldscope contains three
stages a specimen stage in which
to place the slide, an optics stage that
holds a ball lens and an illumination
stage that contains an LED light.
To view the specimen sample,
users place their eyebrow against the
paper with their eye close to the lens,
in a fashion similar to the use of a tra
ditional microscope. Magnification
and image panning are controlled by
the user's thumbs, including sliding
to view different parts of the image
and using a simple flexing mecha
nism to control magnification.
In late 2012, Prakash and his
team received a $lOO,OOO grant from
the Grand Challenges Explorations,
an initiative of the Bill & Melinda
Gates Foundation, in order to field
test the microscope.
Jim Cybulski Ph.D. 'l4, a mechan
ical engineering doctoral student,
was part of Prakash's field team and
has travelled to underdeveloped ar
eas in Nigeria and India to investi
gate the microscope's applications
there.
"It's really a different experience
once you get outside the lab," Cybul
ski said. "You understand how people
perceive it and how it fits into their
daily life."
According to Cybulski, field test
ing has revealed several concerns
about using Foldscope, including eye
strain, ergonomics and examining
potentially infectious samples so
close to one's body.
As a result, the team is developing
a different type of microscope for
certain riskier circum
stances. This specialized mi
croscope will feature a pro
jection system that allows
for a magnified image to be
projected against a wall.
In the same style of the
original Foldscope, this mi
croscope will still be finan
cially feasible, with a target
cost of about 10 dollars.
In the future, according
to Cybulski and Prakash,
Foldscopes will be designed
so that each type of disease
will have a correlating Fold
scope meant exclusively for
that disease, minimizing
price and bypassing the dif
ficult process of optimiza
tion seen with traditional
multipurpose microscopes.
Prakash noted that the
microscopes have two dis
tinct but interrelated appli
cations: use in education
by opening up microscopy to
students and in diagnos
tic healthcare in regions
where microscopes may not
be widely available.
Although the initial goal
of the project was to help
improve healthcare,
Prakash argued that using
Foldscopes for education
has become integral to its
development.
"We have a very simple
goal that every single kid in
the world should grow up
with a microscope," Prakash
said. "We should all be car
rying around microscopes in
our pocket all the time."

The team's Ten Thou
sand Microscope Project
tasks participants with help
ing to test Foldscopes in dif
ferent situations around the
world, forming a crowd
sourced knowledge bank.
Approximately 8,000 people
have already signed up, with
nearly 25 nations represent
ed.
Each recipient is asked
to contribute a short report
detailing a science experi
ment, exploration or other
activity performed with the
Foldscope in order to form
a large "repository of cu
riosity," as Prakash puts it.
One of the participants re
ported convincing Mongo
lian farmers of the need to
pasteurize their milk using
Foldscope, and a young girl
elsewhere used the paper
microscope to examine
dead bees in order to un
derstand why they die.
Going forward, Cybulski
cited fluorescence imaging,
in which certain materials
emit different colors of
light than those shone on
them, as a potential area of
expansion. Meanwhile,
Prakash hesitated to identi
fy a specific future for Fold
scope but emphasized the
innovation's broader impli
cations.
"Microscopy is just away
to think about the world,"
Prakash said. "It is very
much is a window into the
world, but what you do with
it is very, very, very broad
and it cannot be anticipat
ed."
