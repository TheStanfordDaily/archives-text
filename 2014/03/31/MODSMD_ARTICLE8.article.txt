## Researchers develop paper microscope 
### SKYLAR COHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A team of Stanford researchers
has developed an ultra-low cost pa
per microscope that offers the poten
tial for more effective disease diagno
sis in developing regions.
According to Assistant Professor
of Bioengineering Manu Prakash,
the Foldscope was inspired by meth
ods of mass production that Prakash
witnessed while traveling in India
and Thailand. Prakash subsequently
applied that concept of scalability to
meeting the challenges of diseases he
had encountered in Africa.
Each Foldscope contains three
stages a specimen stage in which
to place the slide, an optics stage that
holds a ball lens and an illumination
stage that contains an LED light.
To view the specimen sample,
users place their eyebrow against the
paper with their eye close to the lens,
in a fashion similar to the use of a tra
ditional microscope. Magnification
and image panning are controlled by
the user's thumbs, including sliding
to view different parts of the image
and using a simple flexing mecha
nism to control magnification.
In late 2012, Prakash and his
team received a $lOO,OOO grant from
the Grand Challenges Explorations,
an initiative of the Bill & Melinda
Gates Foundation, in order to field
test the microscope.
Jim Cybulski Ph.D. 'l4, a mechan
ical engineering doctoral student,
was part of Prakash's field team and
has travelled to underdeveloped ar
eas in Nigeria and India to investi
gate the microscope's applications
there.
"It's really a different experience
once you get outside the lab," Cybul
ski said. "You understand how people
perceive it and how it fits into their
daily life."
According to Cybulski, field test
ing has revealed several concerns
about using Foldscope, including eye
strain, ergonomics and examining
potentially infectious samples so
close to one's body.
As a result, the team is developing
a different type of microscope for
