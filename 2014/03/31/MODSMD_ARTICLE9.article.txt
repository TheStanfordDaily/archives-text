## Students develop 'Career catalyst' 
### KYLIE JUE DESK EDITOR 
As some students enter spring
quarter still in search of elusive
summer internships, a startup
founded by four engineering stu
dents has sought to fix the "broken"
hiring process.
A play on the word "career,"
Kaziir founded by Kevin Chavez
'l4, Alexandra Welch 'l6, Alex Lin
'l4 and Kai Kuspa 'l4 began dur
ing winter quarter as a project for
ENGR 145: Technology Entrepre
neurship. Students in the course
form groups of three to five and
spend 10 weeks learning about en
trepreneurship by developing a
startup or product idea. Each team
is also paired with a mentor who has
a background in an area relevant to
the team's project.
"If I had to encapsulate Kaziir in
one sentence, I think Kaziir is like a
career catalyst," said Greg Jor
gensen, mentor for the Kaziir team.
"It connects inquisitive students
with tech recruiters in an easy-to
use Q&A platform of discovery, ex
change and linkage."
According to Chuck Eesley, as
sistant professor of management
science and engineering and in
structor for the class, the theme last
quarter was recruiting, with teams
tasked with redesigning the
process.
Although many projects stood
out, Eesley described Kaziir's dis
tinguishing factor as its focus on
customer input. According to
Eesley, a common problem with
teams, especially those with only en
gineers, is that they place too much
emphasis on building the technology
while ignoring the market need.
"They've had a good balance of
both being able to build some proto
type of the site and also ... talking to
actual recruiters and really under
standing their needs well before
they build out the engineering,"
Eesley said.
"Talking to people who are in the
recruiters' perspective and under
standing that side of the market I
think is the more difficult part," he
added.
The founders noted that they
would even speak to recruiters di
rectly after going through job inter
views themselves. Through their

conversations, they learned that one
of recruiters' biggest problems is
having to sort through too many re
sumes.
They also found that companies
have struggled with workers who
may want a position at a prestigious
company solely for the brand name
but end up disliking their work. The
cost of hiring and training an intern
who only stays for a short amount of
time is nontrivial.
"It's a big problem because while
it's a good experience and you get
Apple or Google on your resume,
your actual work wasn't that inter
esting [to you], and you don't want
to continue doing it," Chavez said.
A new way of recruiting
In general, the team found that
companies want to move away from
using resumes as the main factor in
selecting interview candidates.
"They're getting away from this
idea that some of your past accom
plishments are going to be the best
indicators for what you're going to
be doing in the future," Kuspa said.
"They're trying to find new ways of
matching their recruits to their job
positions, and we want to be that
new tool."
With the current system, accord
ing to the Kaziir team, companies
run the risk of overlooking viable
candidates by chance or because
they might be missing a "buzz word"
in their resume.
"From a student perspective, it
seems [recruiting] can be very un
fair at times, and it gives certain
people an advantage if you have that
insider info on what buzz words that
you want to put down," Lin ex
plained.
Kaziir matches companies and
applicants anonymously and based
on mutual interests. The founders
emphasized that anonymity pre
vents any unintentional discrimina
tion on the companies' part based on
race, gender, age or even major.
"We really just want to remove
as many biases as we can and find
exactly where people would be hap
piest and most productive in what
ever job they choose," Kuspa said.
The founders have also designed
an algorithm that will match appli
cants with companies. Using com
puter vision and machine learning
algorithms, they aim to create vec

tors representing both the appli
cants themselves and also re
cruiters' search criteria.
"It's really a flexible filter which
takes more things into account than
just the resume," Kuspa said.
"We're trying to create vectors of
how you work in teams, how cre
ative you are, what past skills you
have, what sort of things you exhib
it in your interview."
"The recruiters are using the
same algorithm to search through
these people," Kuspa added.
The team also aimed to prevent
recruitment work being lost after an
interview with a potential employer
is over. Rather than having to start
from scratch, students should be
able to learn from and build off the
applications they have already com
pleted, even if they did not get a job
offer, according to the founders.
"We've all had that same job
struggle you send out your re
sume to all these big companies hop
ing to get a summer internship, and
most of them you never hear back
from," Welch said. "It'd be cool for
that not to happen so even if you
don't hear back from a company, you
still make progress."
With Kaziir, students all get a
first chance at an interview by solv
ing challenge problems. The Kaziir
team has worked with different

companies to design the problems,
and applicants can work on the chal
lenges with friends.
"We give everyone a first shot at
that first interview, and instead of
doing it alone you can do it with your
friends," Kuspa explained. "We can
look at how you interact with a team,
what types of questions you ask
when you work with your different
partners, what type of content you
generate."
In addition to removing the in
timidation that comes from a three
hour one-on-one technical interview,
Kaziir's group challenges also aim to
better model the work experience
while still indicating who con
tributed which aspect of the an
swers.
"In the real world, no one actual
ly works just on their own in an iso
lated vacuum," Kuspa added.
"There's always a team effort so we
think [group interviews are] proba
bly going to be a bit more accurate
of when you're actually doing a job."
Furthermore, the site gives
users "directed feedback." Analyz
ing information both from students'
previous interviews and also from
recruiters themselves, Kaziir will
suggest companies at which an ap
plicant might be more successful.
All four founders empathized
with the fact that, as a student, find

ing a job that interests you can be
difficult.
"By just seeing these interesting
challenges, you can see what type of
problems really get you excited,"
Welch said. "You're connecting more
on a basis of mutual interest so that
way it's just a better lit for you over
all —wherever you're going."
As a result, students of all grades
will be able to find a use for the site.
"People who are freshmen and
sophomores could actually be the
biggest user base for Kaziir because
we could help them discover what
types of jobs they want to do," Kus
pa said. 'And then for the upper
classmen, it really is about 'let's find
a job now and let's do it quickly.'"
Plans for the future
Eesley explained of the 10 to 20
teams formed in ENGRI4S, usually
three to five will continue working
on their companies. Of the 10 teams
in the class this quarter, Eesley be
lieved that Kaziir is one of those
teams that could go beyond the
class. In fact, the team has already
spoken to Jorgensen about then
plans for the future.
"We've already discussed contin
uing the work after they graduate
and see where we go with it. I'm ex-

cited about working with
them," Jorgensen said.
According to Welch, the
company currently has 62
users and is hoping to grow
over the next few weeks be
fore their alpha launch, which
will be released early this
quarter. Currently, students
can put their names and
emails on Kaziir's signup
page to be contacted as the
site develops.

Although currently sub
scribed companies are most
ly local, in the long run, Kazi
ir hopes to expand beyond
tech companies in the Bay
Area.
"We really want to build a
tool that will be relevant to all
students on campus, and not
just a smaller subset," Kuspa
said. "This is a problem
which a lot of people experi
ence so everyone has a
shared sense of what needs
to be done and how it can be
improved."

puter vision and machine learning
algorithms, they aim to create vec

tors representing both the appli
cants themselves and also re
cruiters' search criteria.
"It's really a flexible filter which
takes more things into account than
just the resume," Kuspa said.
"We're trying to create vectors of
how you work in teams, how cre
ative you are, what past skills you
have, what sort of things you exhib
it in your interview."
"The recruiters are using the
same algorithm to search through
these people," Kuspa added.
The team also aimed to prevent
recruitment work being lost after an
interview with a potential employer
is over. Rather than having to start
from scratch, students should be
able to learn from and build off the
applications they have already com
pleted, even if they did not get a job
offer, according to the founders.
"We've all had that same job
struggle you send out your re
sume to all these big companies hop
ing to get a summer internship, and
most of them you never hear back
from," Welch said. "It'd be cool for
that not to happen so even if you
don't hear back from a company, you
still make progress."
With Kaziir, students all get a
first chance at an interview by solv
ing challenge problems. The Kaziir
team has worked with different

companies to design the problems,
and applicants can work on the chal
lenges with friends.
"We give everyone a first shot at
that first interview, and instead of
doing it alone you can do it with your
friends," Kuspa explained. "We can
look at how you interact with a team,
what types of questions you ask
when you work with your different
partners, what type of content you
generate."
In addition to removing the in
timidation that comes from a three
hour one-on-one technical interview,
Kaziir's group challenges also aim to
better model the work experience
while still indicating who con
tributed which aspect of the an
swers.
"In the real world, no one actual
ly works just on their own in an iso
lated vacuum," Kuspa added.
"There's always a team effort so we
think [group interviews are] proba
bly going to be a bit more accurate
of when you're actually doing a job."
Furthermore, the site gives
users "directed feedback." Analyz
ing information both from students'
previous interviews and also from
recruiters themselves, Kaziir will
suggest companies at which an ap
plicant might be more successful.
All four founders empathized
with the fact that, as a student, find

ing a job that interests you can be
difficult.
"By just seeing these interesting
challenges, you can see what type of
problems really get you excited,"
Welch said. "You're connecting more
on a basis of mutual interest so that
way it's just a better lit for you over
all —wherever you're going."
As a result, students of all grades
will be able to find a use for the site.
"People who are freshmen and
sophomores could actually be the
biggest user base for Kaziir because
we could help them discover what
types of jobs they want to do," Kus
pa said. 'And then for the upper
classmen, it really is about 'let's find
a job now and let's do it quickly.'"
Plans for the future
Eesley explained of the 10 to 20
teams formed in ENGRI4S, usually
three to five will continue working
on their companies. Of the 10 teams
in the class this quarter, Eesley be
lieved that Kaziir is one of those
teams that could go beyond the
class. In fact, the team has already
spoken to Jorgensen about then
plans for the future.
"We've already discussed contin
uing the work after they graduate
and see where we go with it. I'm ex-

cited about working with
them," Jorgensen said.
According to Welch, the
company currently has 62
users and is hoping to grow
over the next few weeks be
fore their alpha launch, which
will be released early this
quarter. Currently, students
can put their names and
emails on Kaziir's signup
page to be contacted as the
site develops.

Although currently sub
scribed companies are most
ly local, in the long run, Kazi
ir hopes to expand beyond
tech companies in the Bay
Area.
"We really want to build a
tool that will be relevant to all
students on campus, and not
just a smaller subset," Kuspa
said. "This is a problem
which a lot of people experi
ence so everyone has a
shared sense of what needs
to be done and how it can be

As some students enter spring
quarter still in search of elusive
summer internships, a startup
founded by four engineering stu
dents has sought to fix the "broken"
hiring process.
A play on the word "career,"
Kaziir founded by Kevin Chavez
'l4, Alexandra Welch 'l6, Alex Lin
'l4 and Kai Kuspa 'l4 began dur
ing winter quarter as a project for
ENGR 145: Technology Entrepre
neurship. Students in the course
form groups of three to five and
spend 10 weeks learning about en
trepreneurship by developing a
startup or product idea. Each team
is also paired with a mentor who has
a background in an area relevant to
the team's project.
"If I had to encapsulate Kaziir in
one sentence, I think Kaziir is like a
career catalyst," said Greg Jor
gensen, mentor for the Kaziir team.
"It connects inquisitive students
with tech recruiters in an easy-to
use Q&A platform of discovery, ex
change and linkage."
According to Chuck Eesley, as
sistant professor of management
science and engineering and in
structor for the class, the theme last
quarter was recruiting, with teams
tasked with redesigning the
process.
Although many projects stood
out, Eesley described Kaziir's dis
tinguishing factor as its focus on
customer input. According to
Eesley, a common problem with
teams, especially those with only en
gineers, is that they place too much
emphasis on building the technology
while ignoring the market need.
"They've had a good balance of
both being able to build some proto
type of the site and also ... talking to
actual recruiters and really under
standing their needs well before
they build out the engineering,"
Eesley said.
"Talking to people who are in the
recruiters' perspective and under
standing that side of the market I
think is the more difficult part," he
added.
The founders noted that they
would even speak to recruiters di
rectly after going through job inter
views themselves. Through their

conversations, they learned that one
of recruiters' biggest problems is
having to sort through too many re
sumes.
They also found that companies
have struggled with workers who
may want a position at a prestigious
company solely for the brand name
but end up disliking their work. The
cost of hiring and training an intern
who only stays for a short amount of
time is nontrivial.
"It's a big problem because while
it's a good experience and you get
Apple or Google on your resume,
your actual work wasn't that inter
esting [to you], and you don't want
to continue doing it," Chavez said.
A new way of recruiting
In general, the team found that
companies want to move away from
using resumes as the main factor in
selecting interview candidates.
"They're getting away from this
idea that some of your past accom
plishments are going to be the best
indicators for what you're going to
be doing in the future," Kuspa said.
"They're trying to find new ways of
matching their recruits to their job
positions, and we want to be that
new tool."
With the current system, accord
ing to the Kaziir team, companies
run the risk of overlooking viable
candidates by chance or because
they might be missing a "buzz word"
in their resume.
"From a student perspective, it
seems [recruiting] can be very un
fair at times, and it gives certain
people an advantage if you have that
insider info on what buzz words that
you want to put down," Lin ex
plained.
Kaziir matches companies and
applicants anonymously and based
on mutual interests. The founders
emphasized that anonymity pre
vents any unintentional discrimina
tion on the companies' part based on
race, gender, age or even major.
"We really just want to remove
as many biases as we can and find
exactly where people would be hap
piest and most productive in what
ever job they choose," Kuspa said.
The founders have also designed
an algorithm that will match appli
cants with companies. Using com
puter vision and machine learning
algorithms, they aim to create vec

tors representing both the appli
cants themselves and also re
cruiters' search criteria.
"It's really a flexible filter which
takes more things into account than
just the resume," Kuspa said.
"We're trying to create vectors of
how you work in teams, how cre
ative you are, what past skills you

As some students enter spring
quarter still in search of elusive
summer internships, a startup
founded by four engineering stu
dents has sought to fix the "broken"
hiring process.
A play on the word "career,"
Kaziir founded by Kevin Chavez
'l4, Alexandra Welch 'l6, Alex Lin
'l4 and Kai Kuspa 'l4 began dur
ing winter quarter as a project for
ENGR 145: Technology Entrepre
neurship. Students in the course
form groups of three to five and
spend 10 weeks learning about en
trepreneurship by developing a
startup or product idea. Each team
is also paired with a mentor who has
a background in an area relevant to
the team's project.
"If I had to encapsulate Kaziir in
one sentence, I think Kaziir is like a
career catalyst," said Greg Jor
gensen, mentor for the Kaziir team.
"It connects inquisitive students
with tech recruiters in an easy-to
use Q&A platform of discovery, ex
change and linkage."
According to Chuck Eesley, as
sistant professor of management
science and engineering and in
structor for the class, the theme last
quarter was recruiting, with teams
tasked with redesigning the
process.
Although many projects stood
out, Eesley described Kaziir's dis
tinguishing factor as its focus on
customer input. According to
Eesley, a common problem with
teams, especially those with only en
gineers, is that they place too much
emphasis on building the technology
while ignoring the market need.
"They've had a good balance of
both being able to build some proto
type of the site and also ... talking to
actual recruiters and really under
standing their needs well before
they build out the engineering,"
Eesley said.
"Talking to people who are in the
recruiters' perspective and under
standing that side of the market I
think is the more difficult part," he
added.
The founders noted that they
would even speak to recruiters di
rectly after going through job inter
views themselves. Through their

conversations, they learned that one
of recruiters' biggest problems is
having to sort through too many re
sumes.
They also found that companies
have struggled with workers who
may want a position at a prestigious
company solely for the brand name
but end up disliking their work. The
cost of hiring and training an intern
who only stays for a short amount of
time is nontrivial.
"It's a big problem because while
it's a good experience and you get
Apple or Google on your resume,
your actual work wasn't that inter
esting [to you], and you don't want
to continue doing it," Chavez said.
A new way of recruiting
In general, the team found that
companies want to move away from
using resumes as the main factor in
selecting interview candidates.
"They're getting away from this
idea that some of your past accom
plishments are going to be the best
indicators for what you're going to
be doing in the future," Kuspa said.
"They're trying to find new ways of
matching their recruits to their job
positions, and we want to be that
new tool."
With the current system, accord
ing to the Kaziir team, companies
run the risk of overlooking viable
candidates by chance or because
they might be missing a "buzz word"
in their resume.
"From a student perspective, it
seems [recruiting] can be very un
fair at times, and it gives certain
people an advantage if you have that
insider info on what buzz words that
you want to put down," Lin ex
plained.
Kaziir matches companies and
applicants anonymously and based
on mutual interests. The founders
emphasized that anonymity pre
vents any unintentional discrimina
tion on the companies' part based on
race, gender, age or even major.
"We really just want to remove
as many biases as we can and find
exactly where people would be hap
piest and most productive in what
ever job they choose," Kuspa said.
The founders have also designed
an algorithm that will match appli
cants with companies. Using com
puter vision and machine learning
algorithms, they aim to create vec

tors representing both the appli
cants themselves and also re
cruiters' search criteria.
"It's really a flexible filter which
takes more things into account than
just the resume," Kuspa said.
"We're trying to create vectors of
how you work in teams, how cre
ative you are, what past skills you
have, what sort of things you exhib
it in your interview."
"The recruiters are using the
same algorithm to search through
these people," Kuspa added.
The team also aimed to prevent
recruitment work being lost after an
interview with a potential employer
is over. Rather than having to start
from scratch, students should be
able to learn from and build off the
applications they have already com
pleted, even if they did not get a job
offer, according to the founders.
"We've all had that same job
struggle you send out your re
sume to all these big companies hop
ing to get a summer internship, and
most of them you never hear back
from," Welch said. "It'd be cool for
that not to happen so even if you
don't hear back from a company, you
still make progress."
With Kaziir, students all get a
first chance at an interview by solv
ing challenge problems. The Kaziir
team has worked with different

companies to design the problems,
and applicants can work on the chal
lenges with friends.
"We give everyone a first shot at
that first interview, and instead of
doing it alone you can do it with your
friends," Kuspa explained. "We can
look at how you interact with a team,
what types of questions you ask
when you work with your different
partners, what type of content you
generate."
In addition to removing the in
timidation that comes from a three
hour one-on-one technical interview,
Kaziir's group challenges also aim to
better model the work experience
while still indicating who con
tributed which aspect of the an
swers.
"In the real world, no one actual
ly works just on their own in an iso
lated vacuum," Kuspa added.
"There's always a team effort so we
think [group interviews are] proba
bly going to be a bit more accurate
of when you're actually doing a job."
Furthermore, the site gives
users "directed feedback." Analyz
ing information both from students'
previous interviews and also from
recruiters themselves, Kaziir will
suggest companies at which an ap
plicant might be more successful.
All four founders empathized
with the fact that, as a student, find

ing a job that interests you can be
difficult.
"By just seeing these interesting
challenges, you can see what type of
problems really get you excited,"
Welch said. "You're connecting more
on a basis of mutual interest so that
way it's just a better lit for you over
all —wherever you're going."
As a result, students of all grades
will be able to find a use for the site.
"People who are freshmen and
sophomores could actually be the
biggest user base for Kaziir because
we could help them discover what
types of jobs they want to do," Kus
pa said. 'And then for the upper
classmen, it really is about 'let's find
a job now and let's do it quickly.'"
Plans for the future
Eesley explained of the 10 to 20
teams formed in ENGRI4S, usually
three to five will continue working
on their companies. Of the 10 teams
in the class this quarter, Eesley be
lieved that Kaziir is one of those
teams that could go beyond the
class. In fact, the team has already
spoken to Jorgensen about then
plans for the future.
"We've already discussed contin
uing the work after they graduate
and see where we go with it. I'm ex-
