# ONE MORE FOR FINAL FOUR
## STANFORD, CALIF. 6 RM. COVERAGE: TV ESPN RADIO KZSU9O.I FM (kzsu.stanford.edu) 
### LAUREN LOCKETT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The second-seeded Stanford
women's basketball team (32-3)
will aim to continue its road to the
Final Four on Tuesday night as it
takes on the fourth-seeded North
Carolina Tar Heels (27-9) in the
regional final. The Cardinal will be
seeking to advance to their sixth
Final Four in seven years.
Since being booted early from
the Pac-12 Tournament, the Cardi
nal have been on a mission not to
face a similar disappointment to
end their season. The team played
one of its best and most complete
games of the year in its 82-57
Sweet Sixteen victory against
Penn State.
"Our experiences last year los
ing in the Sweet 16 do bring in
some kind of experience," said
senior guard Sara James. "Like
[head coach] Tara [VanDerveer]
always says, 'We play with a chip
on our shoulder.' We're not happy
just getting to this Elite Eight
game. We're excited to get back to
the Final Four."
It will require a similarly
strong effort in the upcoming
round to advance against the Tar
Heels and return to the Final
Four. North Carolina is led by star
freshman Diamond DeShields,
who averages 18.1 points and 5.4
rebounds per game. However, dur
ing North Carolina's last matchup
on Sunday, DeShields rolled her
right ankle and aggravated a left
knee injury. The Tar Heels will de
cide near tipoff whether DeShields
will appear in Tuesday night's
game.
Assuming she plays, as she is
expected to, Stanford's defense

will have a big task on its hands.
DeShields' athleticism, scoring
ability and 6-foot-l frame make
her a tough matchup for nearly
any defender in the nation. In or
der for the Cardinal to advance,
they must limit DeShields and the

rest of the Tar Heels on the offen
sive end. The Tar Heels boast a
mix of size, athleticism and skills
that make them very dangerous,
especially in the open court.
"Lili [Thompson] sort of head
lined our game yesterday with her

defense and it will be another chal
lenge for us to see who will step up
and defend DeShields, because
she is very talented from the wing,
especially in her mid-range," said
senior forward Chiney Ogwumike.
"[North Carolina is] a very ath
letic team," VanDerveer said.
"They're very explosive. They're a
little bit unpredictable in a dan
gerous way. They make a lot hap
pen with their athleticism, in tran
sition, on the glass, creating one
on-one shots. We are just opposite
teams."

Stanford will once again be led
by Ogwumike as she attempts to
dominate both ends of the floor
like she has done so many times
this season. In the Cardinal's
Sweet 16 victory against Penn
State, Ogwumike contributed 29
points, 15 rebounds, three assists
and two steals to the Cardinal's ef
fort. Freshman Lili Thompson also
shone on the defensive end, effec
tively shutting down Penn State
guard Maggie Lucas.
With the game being played on
their home floor at Maples Pavil
ion, at which the Sweet 16
matchup was sold out, the Cardi
nal will certainly have the benefit
of home-court advantage. Howev
er, North Carolina will be playing
with extra motivation as well. If
the Tar Heels advance to the Final
Four, head coach Sylvia Hatchell is
expected to rejoin the team after
having taken a leave of absence
this year while battling leukemia.
The game will tip off at 6 p.m.
and will be televised on ESPN.
The winner of the matchup will
face first-seeded Connecticut.

any defender in the nation. In or
der for the Cardinal to advance,
they must limit DeShields and the

rest of the Tar Heels on the offen
sive end. The Tar Heels boast a
mix of size, athleticism and skills
that make them very dangerous,
especially in the open court.
"Lili [Thompson] sort of head
lined our game yesterday with her

defense and it will be another chal
lenge for us to see who will step up
and defend DeShields, because
she is very talented from the wing,
especially in her mid-range," said
senior forward Chiney Ogwumike.
"[North Carolina is] a very ath
letic team," VanDerveer said.
"They're very explosive. They're a
little bit unpredictable in a dan
gerous way. They make a lot hap
pen with their athleticism, in tran
sition, on the glass, creating one
on-one shots. We are just opposite
teams."

Stanford will once again be led
by Ogwumike as she attempts to
dominate both ends of the floor
like she has done so many times
this season. In the Cardinal's
Sweet 16 victory against Penn
State, Ogwumike contributed 29
points, 15 rebounds, three assists
and two steals to the Cardinal's ef
fort. Freshman Lili Thompson also
shone on the defensive end, effec
tively shutting down Penn State
guard Maggie Lucas.
With the game being played on
their home floor at Maples Pavil
ion, at which the Sweet 16
matchup was sold out, the Cardi
nal will certainly have the benefit
of home-court advantage. Howev
er, North Carolina will be playing
with extra motivation as well. If
the Tar Heels advance to the Final
Four, head coach Sylvia Hatchell is
expected to rejoin the team after
having taken a leave of absence
this year while battling leukemia.
The game will tip off at 6 p.m.
and will be televised on ESPN.
The winner of the matchup will
face first-seeded Connecticut.
