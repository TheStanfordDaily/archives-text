## SECONDARY SETTLES IN 
### JOSEPH BEYDA FOOTBALL EDITOR 
Rising junior Dallas Lloyd, fresh off
his transition from quarterback to safe
ty late last season, has been getting a
lot of advice from a pair of football gi
ants this spring: Duane Akina and
Richard Sherman 'lO.
Akina, a 35-year coaching veteran
known as one of the best defensive
backs coaches in the country, just ar
rived on the Farm a few weeks ago;
Monday's practice kicking off the sec
ond session of spring ball was his first
chance to interact with the Cardinal's
secondary on the field. In the mean
time, Lloyd has learned a thing or two
from Sherman, who has worked out on
campus during the NFL offseason.
"He said coming from the offense is
unique because you have the perspec
tive of someone who's on the offense,"
Lloyd said. "You have route concepts
and what receivers are trying to do, and
being a quarterback before, techniques
that quarterbacks use to look safeties
off, where their eyes are, their shoul
ders."
Of course, Sherman switched from

offense to defense at Stanford before
becoming an All-Pro cornerback and
Super Bowl champion with the Seattle
Seahawks. Lloyd also has the chance to
reinvent himself as well, coming off a
season that saw him lose the keys to
the Cardinal's read-option package due
to fumbling issues.
Akina likes what he sees so far from
both Lloyd and classmate Kodi Whit
field, who was converted from a wide
receiver to a defensive back this offsea
son. Yet he cautioned that the moves
might take time.
"[Lloyd is] a big athlete that can
run, and I think there's some tremen
dous upside," Akina said. "So I just
think we need reps. It's not a position
that's just 'add water, instant football
player.' It takes time to develop."
Also developing this spring is the
relationship between the defensive
backs and their new coach, who will
take over for former defensive coordi
nator Derek Mason at the helm of the
position group. The early returns are
good.
