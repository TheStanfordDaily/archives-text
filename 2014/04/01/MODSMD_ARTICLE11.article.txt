# FOOTBALL NOTES
## SECONDARY SETTLES IN 
### JOSEPH BEYDA FOOTBALL EDITOR 
Rising junior Dallas Lloyd, fresh off
his transition from quarterback to safe
ty late last season, has been getting a
lot of advice from a pair of football gi
ants this spring: Duane Akina and
Richard Sherman 'lO.
Akina, a 35-year coaching veteran
known as one of the best defensive
backs coaches in the country, just ar
rived on the Farm a few weeks ago;
Monday's practice kicking off the sec
ond session of spring ball was his first
chance to interact with the Cardinal's
secondary on the field. In the mean
time, Lloyd has learned a thing or two
from Sherman, who has worked out on
campus during the NFL offseason.
"He said coming from the offense is
unique because you have the perspec
tive of someone who's on the offense,"
Lloyd said. "You have route concepts
and what receivers are trying to do, and
being a quarterback before, techniques
that quarterbacks use to look safeties
off, where their eyes are, their shoul
ders."
Of course, Sherman switched from

offense to defense at Stanford before
becoming an All-Pro cornerback and
Super Bowl champion with the Seattle
Seahawks. Lloyd also has the chance to
reinvent himself as well, coming off a
season that saw him lose the keys to
the Cardinal's read-option package due
to fumbling issues.
Akina likes what he sees so far from
both Lloyd and classmate Kodi Whit
field, who was converted from a wide
receiver to a defensive back this offsea
son. Yet he cautioned that the moves
might take time.
"[Lloyd is] a big athlete that can
run, and I think there's some tremen
dous upside," Akina said. "So I just
think we need reps. It's not a position
that's just 'add water, instant football
player.' It takes time to develop."
Also developing this spring is the
relationship between the defensive
backs and their new coach, who will
take over for former defensive coordi
nator Derek Mason at the helm of the
position group. The early returns are
good.

Sophomore Dallas Lloyd (above) hopes to crack the Cardinal's
secondary this upcoming season after moving over to
the defensive side from quarterback, his position last year.
"I guess it's different
from Coach Mason, but it's
the same in that it's a guy
that wants to win, [and] is a
real smart coach," said sec
ond-year starting strong
safety Jordan Richards.
"And we're excited to play
for him."

"It's just very apparent
that he cares about us as
people," Lloyd added. "He
compared us to his sons
he has a lot of sons and
he said that he's going to
coach us hard."

Akina said Monday that
he considered taking a
break from coaching after
the staffing change at
Texas, but that he has ad
mired Stanford on film for
years and was intrigued by
the Cardinal's coaches and
their philosophy.
"I just believe they've
cracked the code," Akina
said. "They've been able to
take that competitive spirit
in the classroom and they
brought it to the grass."

Akina also noted that the
move brings him closer to
Hawaii, where he was born.

Head coach David Shaw
was asked about last week's
controversial decision by the
National Labor Relations
Board, which ruled that col
lege football players at
Northwestern and, by
extension, other private
schools such as Stanford
could unionize as employees
of their university. Shaw
said that he was confused by
the motivation for the case
because of how well North

western provides for its
players, and he said that
Stanford's program is an ex
ample of the financial bene
fits already provided to col
lege athletes.
"You talk about a place
like this, where it's $60,000 a
year on scholarship, and
they'll get health care and
20-hour weeks," Shaw said.
"There are people who are
chemistry students that
have a lot of hours also. So
I'm curious. I'm curious to
where it goes from here. I'm
curious how it affects every
body, but I'm waiting to see
why this is so vital. We
haven't had a kid go out of
pocket for a surgery. There's
not a kid here, in particular,
that's ever had an issue that
we haven't tried our best to
take care of for a health care
reason. That would go
against everything that we
stand for."

"There's nobody that has
our players' best interests at
heart more than us," Shaw
added later. "If this is a cost
of attendance thing, we'll do
whatever the NCAA allows
us to do. But I'll tell you
this: I know we're prepar
ing these young men for
more than just football.
We're not using them for
anything. We're giving
them an unbelievable edu
cation, unbelievable con
tacts. Hopefully they'll have
a phenomenal experience
here, athletically academi
cally socially. And hopefully
they go on to influence this
great nation. But to insinu
ate that there's anything
we're doing to harm these
young men, I think is just
not correct."
Shaw also addressed
comments made by former
Wildcats quarterback Kain

Colter, who verbally com
mitted to Stanford in 2009
before switching to North
western, where he just fin
ished his final year.
In a recent interview,
Colter implied that the Car
dinal revoked their scholar
ship offer because he in
jured himself early in his
senior year of high school.
Shaw staunchly opposed
that claim.

"I can tell you 100 per
cent, there was no issue
with his injury," Shaw said.
"Our track record speaks
for itself. We've never
dropped a kid from a schol
arship offer or from a com
mitment because of injury
... I [was recruiting in] Col
orado at the time. I went to
his high school. I talked to
his high school coach. I sat
there for an hour and a half
and watched all the kid's
film. There's no way we
dropped the scholarship of
fer because he got hurt."

Shaw added that three
recruits in Colter's class
who did end up coming to
Stanford all suffered sea
son-ending injuries as high
school seniors.

Rising senior wide re
ceiver Ty Montgomery
won't return to the playing
field during the second ses
sion of spring practice,
Shaw confirmed on Monday.
In addition to recovering
from the knee injury he suf
fered in the Rose Bowl on
Jan. 1, Montgomery under
went minor surgery on his
arm to resolve another issue.
Shaw said that his star play
maker would be back in time
for training camp.

of their university. Shaw
said that he was confused by
the motivation for the case
because of how well North

western provides for its
players, and he said that
Stanford's program is an ex
ample of the financial bene
fits already provided to col
lege athletes.
"You talk about a place
like this, where it's $60,000 a
year on scholarship, and
they'll get health care and
20-hour weeks," Shaw said.
"There are people who are
chemistry students that
have a lot of hours also. So
I'm curious. I'm curious to
where it goes from here. I'm
curious how it affects every
body, but I'm waiting to see
why this is so vital. We
haven't had a kid go out of
pocket for a surgery. There's
not a kid here, in particular,
that's ever had an issue that
we haven't tried our best to
take care of for a health care
reason. That would go
against everything that we
stand for."

"There's nobody that has
our players' best interests at
heart more than us," Shaw
added later. "If this is a cost
of attendance thing, we'll do
whatever the NCAA allows
us to do. But I'll tell you
this: I know we're prepar
ing these young men for
more than just football.
We're not using them for
anything. We're giving
them an unbelievable edu
cation, unbelievable con
tacts. Hopefully they'll have
a phenomenal experience
here, athletically academi
cally socially. And hopefully
they go on to influence this
great nation. But to insinu
ate that there's anything
we're doing to harm these
young men, I think is just
not correct."
Shaw also addressed
comments made by former
Wildcats quarterback Kain

Colter, who verbally com
mitted to Stanford in 2009
before switching to North
western, where he just fin
ished his final year.
In a recent interview,
Colter implied that the Car
dinal revoked their scholar
ship offer because he in
jured himself early in his
senior year of high school.
Shaw staunchly opposed
that claim.

"I can tell you 100 per
cent, there was no issue
with his injury," Shaw said.
"Our track record speaks
for itself. We've never
dropped a kid from a schol
arship offer or from a com
mitment because of injury
... I [was recruiting in] Col
orado at the time. I went to
his high school. I talked to
his high school coach. I sat
there for an hour and a half
and watched all the kid's
film. There's no way we
dropped the scholarship of
fer because he got hurt."

Shaw added that three
recruits in Colter's class
who did end up coming to
Stanford all suffered sea
son-ending injuries as high
school seniors.

Rising senior wide re

won't return to the playing
field during the second ses
sion of spring practice,
Shaw confirmed on Monday.
In addition to recovering
from the knee injury he suf

Jan. 1, Montgomery under

arm to resolve another issue.
Shaw said that his star play
maker would be back in time
for training camp.

Rising junior Dallas Lloyd, fresh off
his transition from quarterback to safe
ty late last season, has been getting a
lot of advice from a pair of football gi
ants this spring: Duane Akina and
Richard Sherman 'lO.
Akina, a 35-year coaching veteran
known as one of the best defensive
backs coaches in the country, just ar
rived on the Farm a few weeks ago;
Monday's practice kicking off the sec
ond session of spring ball was his first
chance to interact with the Cardinal's
secondary on the field. In the mean
time, Lloyd has learned a thing or two
from Sherman, who has worked out on
campus during the NFL offseason.
"He said coming from the offense is
unique because you have the perspec
tive of someone who's on the offense,"
Lloyd said. "You have route concepts
and what receivers are trying to do, and
being a quarterback before, techniques
that quarterbacks use to look safeties
off, where their eyes are, their shoul
ders."
Of course, Sherman switched from

offense to defense at Stanford before
becoming an All-Pro cornerback and
Super Bowl champion with the Seattle
Seahawks. Lloyd also has the chance to
reinvent himself as well, coming off a
season that saw him lose the keys to
the Cardinal's read-option package due
to fumbling issues.
Akina likes what he sees so far from
both Lloyd and classmate Kodi Whit
field, who was converted from a wide
receiver to a defensive back this offsea
son. Yet he cautioned that the moves
might take time.
"[Lloyd is] a big athlete that can
run, and I think there's some tremen
dous upside," Akina said. "So I just
think we need reps. It's not a position
that's just 'add water, instant football
player.' It takes time to develop."
Also developing this spring is the
relationship between the defensive
backs and their new coach, who will
take over for former defensive coordi
nator Derek Mason at the helm of the
position group. The early returns are
good.

Sophomore Dallas Lloyd (above) hopes to crack the Cardinal's
secondary this upcoming season after moving over to
the defensive side from quarterback, his position last year.
"I guess it's different
from Coach Mason, but it's
the same in that it's a guy
that wants to win, [and] is a
real smart coach," said sec
ond-year starting strong
safety Jordan Richards.
"And we're excited to play
for him."

"It's just very apparent
that he cares about us as
people," Lloyd added. "He
compared us to his sons
he has a lot of sons and
he said that he's going to
coach us hard."

Akina said Monday that
he considered taking a
break from coaching after
the staffing change at
Texas, but that he has ad
mired Stanford on film for
years and was intrigued by
the Cardinal's coaches and
their philosophy.
"I just believe they've
cracked the code," Akina
said. "They've been able to
take that competitive spirit
in the classroom and they
brought it to the grass."

Akina also noted that the
move brings him closer to
Hawaii, where he was born.
