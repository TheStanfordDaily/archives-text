## Stanford to leave Pac-12, join AAC 
### GEORGE BEYDA FOOTBALL IN CHIEF 
In a shocking turn of events,
Stanford Athletics announced on
Monday that the program would
sever ties with the Pac-12 effec
tive next season and will join the
American Athletic Conference
(AAC) as a full member.
"We're very excited about this
partnership moving forward and
are looking forward to a brighter
future for the American Athletic
Conference," said an AAC offi
cial. "With the departure of
Louisville and Rutgers, we had a
significant void to fill and were
searching for an established, re
spected national program. Stan
ford was the ideal fit for the
opening."
While the Pac-12 has not made
any official comments regarding
the nature of its break with Stan
ford, it is speculated that the
move is occurring largely as a re
sult of Stanford Athletics' dissat
isfaction with the perception of
Pac-12 men's basketball.

"It was an incredible opportu
nity to compete against some of
the best athletes on the West
Coast during our time in the Pac
-12," said a men's basketball play
er on condition of anonymity.
"But after we made the Sweet 16
this year, there was definitely a
hint of disappointment among
members of the team because we
weren't getting the respect we
felt we deserved. We hope that by
having games against the likes of
UConn, Memphis and Cincinnati
every season, we'll be able to ele
vate our standing among the na
tion's best teams."
Stanford football, meanwhile,
will look to have a much easier
path to the first year of the new
College Football Playoff, as its
formerly daunting schedule
against the likes of Oregon,
Washington and USC being re
placed by significantly less es
tablished competition in teams
such as East Carolina and Hous
ton. The only marquee opponent
on its 2014 slate will be defend
ing Fiesta Bowl champion UCF.
"Although our strength of
schedule will decrease, we felt
that it was the best move for all
involved parties moving for

ward," said an anonymous Stan
ford Athletics official. "Stanford
football has enjoyed a mutually
beneficial relationship with the
Pac-12 Conference in the past,
but being able to extend our re
cruiting sphere of influence to a
more East Coast-centric area
was a huge factor in our decision.
We're very excited to see the new
heights that we can reach as a
member of the AAC."
Stanford's vacated spot in the
Pac-12 will reportedly be filled by
either Boise State or San Jose
State moving into next season,
with talks already underway be
tween administrators from both
schools and the Pac-12 Confer
ence.
