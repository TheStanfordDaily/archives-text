# Alex Rodriguez hired as assistant baseball coach
## 
### LENNAY KEKUA MANTI TEO'S GIRLFRIEND 
Currently suspended New
York Yankees third baseman Alex
Rodriguez accepted an offer to be

come an assistant coach for the
Stanford baseball team on Mon
day. Despite his plans to return to
play for the Yankees next season
after his suspension ends, Ro
driguez will coach for the Cardinal
for the remainder of this season.
"I'm excited to be a part of
such a great program," said Ro
driguez at his introductory press
conference. "Obviously, I have ze
ro collegiate experience but I
think that I bring a unique under
standing of the game of baseball
and hopefully I can share my ex
periences with these young ball
players."
The Seattle Mariners drafted
Rodriguez in 1993 straight from
high school. Although he never
played college baseball, he brings
a career .299 batting average and
654 home runs to his role as an
instructor for Stanford's hitters.
"To be honest, I was a little
jealous of [Stanford coach] Ryan
Garko," Rodriguez said. "If some
one should be able to leave the ma
jors and get a job as a hitting coach
at such a young age, it should be
me."
The shocking move seemingly
came out of left field, as Ro
driguez really had no connec
tions with Stanford. Rather
than staying in New York to
help some of the younger Yan
kees develop, Rodriguez bolt
ed to the West Coast.
"Stanford prides itself

on doing things the right
way and that's something
I've really tried to do
throughout my career,"
said Rodriguez on why he
chose to come to Stanford.
Rodriguez is suspended
for the entirety of the 162-
game regular season and
the playoffs for "conduct
detrimental to baseball."
He has admitted to steroid
use at several different
times in his career and re

ceived a suspension after
his attempts to cover up
more performance-enhanc
ing drug use were revealed.
"There have been some
dark times in my career,"
he said. When asked about
the Yankees opinions on his
decision to come to Stan
ford, Rodriguez had no com
ment.
