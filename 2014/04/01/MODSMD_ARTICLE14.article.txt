## Cheaper and Smarter: Reforming Student Fees at Stanford 
### Justine Moore Olivia Moore 
"T T Then you vote in the ASSU
l/l / election this spring, you'll
V V see something on the ballot
called "SAFE Reform." SAFE Re
form is a comprehensive overhaul of
student group funding that replaces
today's broken fee system with a
new framework that is better for
both students and student groups.
Each undergraduate pays al
most $430 to the ASSU every year
to fund our 800-plus student groups,
adding up to more than $1,700 per
student over four (or more) years
here. We have the highest student
activities fee in the country, but it
doesn't need to be this high to sup
port the amazing student life we en
joy. As it is, inefficiencies in today's
system result in student groups us
ing only 75 percent of the money you
pay every year. The rest is left to sit
in "reserve accounts" that total over
$2 million and grow each year.
SAFE Reform introduces a
more efficient structure that gets
closer to using 100 percent of your
student fees. Because we will use
more of the money you pay, we can
decrease the student fee by approx
imately 15 percent while making
slightly more money available to
student groups. We'll still get to en
joy the programs and events that we
all know and love, but you will pay
less for them. And while the ASSU
Senate will still have the final say on
most decisions, SAFE Reform will
bring students with more funding
experience into the process to make
sure that your money is allocated in
the most efficient and impactful way.
SAFE Reform is also good for
student groups, who can now re
ceive funding at any point during
the year. Currently, Special Fees
groups have to plan their entire
budgets more than a year in ad
vance, and cannot receive additional
ASSU funds for new events or unex
pected expenses. Any group that
doesn't apply for Special Fees is lim
ited to receiving a maximum of
$7,000 through General Fees for the
year. The current system limits
everyone: big groups can't be flexi
ble, and small groups with a big im
pact can't get the money they need.
With SAFE Reform, we elimi
nate the divide between Special
Fees and General Fees groups and
allow any group to get money at any
point during the year. Every group
can apply for three types of grants:
Major Grants, Minor Grants and
Quick Grants. Like Special Fees,
Major Grants will be approved by
the student body in the spring elec
tion, while Minor Grants will be allo
cated monthly in a similar process to
General Fees. Quick Grants will

serve as a "reserve" for all groups,
letting these organizations access
money for special or last-minute ex
penses throughout the year, like
hosting a famous speaker who stops
by the Bay Area.
That leaves the question of our
existing reserves. Of the current re
serves of $2 million, approximately
$1.3 million is held in individual re
serve accounts for Special Fees
groups, and the aggregate value of
these accounts has grown by
$300,000 over the past four years.
Special Fees groups will be allowed
to keep this money, but the accounts
will not continue growing. Under
SAFE Reform, groups won't need
to hold individual reserves because
the Quick Grants fund will serve as
a reserve for everyone. However,
any group that has a specific need
for holding a certain amount in re
serves, such as saving up for a capi
tal expenditure, will be able to apply
to the student body for the ability to
do so. (Case in point: Stanford Con
cert Network, which spends money
to bring performers to Stanford.)
$200,000 of the remaining
$700,000 will continue to be accessi
ble to the Senate for funding initia
tives. The other $500,000 will go into
a secured loan buffer, which will al
low us to purposefully overallocate
funds and get closer to spending all
of the money that you pay each year
instead of the 75% we spend today.
This process will be monitored very
closely by the Financial Manager to
ensure that we don't drain this
buffer.

The whole SAFE Reform team
has been working for over a year on
this long-overdue change, and we've
reached out to hundreds of student
groups and thousands of students.
We hope you want to learn more,
and if you do, we'll be holding a
town hall tonight at 5 p.m. in Old
Union 200 to give a presentation
and answer questions. You can find
more information, including the full
referendum, on our website,
assu.stanford.edu/safe-reform, and
you can reach out to the SAFE Re
form team with any questions or
concerns at

safe@assu.stanford.edu.
We're excited to make the ASSU
better for both students and student
groups. Vote "yes" on SAFE Re
form this Spring vote "yes" to a
funding system that's better for stu
dent groups, "yes" to less bureau
cracy and "yes" to a lower student
fee.

called "SAFE Reform." SAFE Re
form is a comprehensive overhaul of
student group funding that replaces
today's broken fee system with a
new framework that is better for
both students and student groups.
Each undergraduate pays al
most $430 to the ASSU every year
to fund our 800-plus student groups,
adding up to more than $1,700 per
student over four (or more) years
here. We have the highest student
activities fee in the country, but it
doesn't need to be this high to sup
port the amazing student life we en
joy. As it is, inefficiencies in today's
system result in student groups us
ing only 75 percent of the money you
pay every year. The rest is left to sit
in "reserve accounts" that total over
$2 million and grow each year.
SAFE Reform introduces a
more efficient structure that gets
closer to using 100 percent of your
student fees. Because we will use
more of the money you pay, we can
decrease the student fee by approx
imately 15 percent while making
slightly more money available to
student groups. We'll still get to en
joy the programs and events that we
all know and love, but you will pay
less for them. And while the ASSU
Senate will still have the final say on
most decisions, SAFE Reform will
bring students with more funding
experience into the process to make
sure that your money is allocated in
the most efficient and impactful way.
SAFE Reform is also good for
student groups, who can now re
ceive funding at any point during
the year. Currently, Special Fees
groups have to plan their entire
budgets more than a year in ad
vance, and cannot receive additional
ASSU funds for new events or unex
pected expenses. Any group that
doesn't apply for Special Fees is lim
ited to receiving a maximum of
$7,000 through General Fees for the
year. The current system limits
everyone: big groups can't be flexi
ble, and small groups with a big im
pact can't get the money they need.
With SAFE Reform, we elimi
nate the divide between Special
Fees and General Fees groups and
allow any group to get money at any
point during the year. Every group
can apply for three types of grants:
Major Grants, Minor Grants and
Quick Grants. Like Special Fees,
Major Grants will be approved by
the student body in the spring elec
tion, while Minor Grants will be allo
cated monthly in a similar process to
General Fees. Quick Grants will

serve as a "reserve" for all groups,
letting these organizations access
money for special or last-minute ex
penses throughout the year, like
hosting a famous speaker who stops
by the Bay Area.
That leaves the question of our
existing reserves. Of the current re
serves of $2 million, approximately
$1.3 million is held in individual re
serve accounts for Special Fees
groups, and the aggregate value of
these accounts has grown by
$300,000 over the past four years.
Special Fees groups will be allowed
to keep this money, but the accounts
will not continue growing. Under
SAFE Reform, groups won't need
to hold individual reserves because
the Quick Grants fund will serve as
a reserve for everyone. However,
any group that has a specific need
for holding a certain amount in re
serves, such as saving up for a capi
tal expenditure, will be able to apply
to the student body for the ability to
do so. (Case in point: Stanford Con
cert Network, which spends money
to bring performers to Stanford.)
$200,000 of the remaining
$700,000 will continue to be accessi
ble to the Senate for funding initia
tives. The other $500,000 will go into
a secured loan buffer, which will al
low us to purposefully overallocate
funds and get closer to spending all
of the money that you pay each year
instead of the 75% we spend today.
This process will be monitored very
closely by the Financial Manager to
ensure that we don't drain this
buffer.

The whole SAFE Reform team
has been working for over a year on
this long-overdue change, and we've
reached out to hundreds of student
groups and thousands of students.
We hope you want to learn more,
and if you do, we'll be holding a
town hall tonight at 5 p.m. in Old
Union 200 to give a presentation
and answer questions. You can find
more information, including the full
referendum, on our website,
assu.stanford.edu/safe-reform, and
you can reach out to the SAFE Re
form team with any questions or
concerns at

safe@assu.stanford.edu.
We're excited to make the ASSU
better for both students and student
groups. Vote "yes" on SAFE Re
form this Spring vote "yes" to a
funding system that's better for stu
dent groups, "yes" to less bureau
cracy and "yes" to a lower student
fee.
