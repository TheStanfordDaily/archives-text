# Financing the World
## 
### Anthony Ghosn 
In 2002, William Kamkwamba
used bicycle parts, blue gum
tree and scraps to build a wind
mill in his village in Malawi. Only fif
teen, William nevertheless managed
to use the windmill to power several
electrical appliances in his village.
What is striking is that despite
William's lack of money, if William
had applied to Stanford he would
have been ineligible for financial aid.
Without financial aid, William's
inability to pay the full $42,000
would essentially disqualify him
from attending Stanford. Despite
our $lB billion endowment, we still
do not provide financial aid to inter
national students, even though oth
er top-tier universities such as Har
vard do.
Eleven percent of the under
graduate population at Stanford are
international students, all of whom
have had to find alternative ways of
funding their educations. Although
Stanford does not provide informa
tion on the number and source of its
international applications, it is evi
dent that an increase in financial aid
would undoubtedly make Stanford
an option for more students across
the world.
This marginalization of disad
vantaged international students
seems to be a rightable wrong.
Princeton, Harvard, Yale and Dart
mouth are all schools of a compara
bly high caliber and financial stand
ing that admit international stu
dents on a need-blind basis. For this
reason it is genuinely surprising
that despite the fact that Stanford
routinely the best fundraiser in
higher education raised a record
$1 billion dollars last year, it has yet
to open itself up to financing oppor

tunities for international students
without Social Security numbers.
Our university has been widely
characterized in popular media as
being a "Get Rich U" that feeds the
machine of innovation that is Silicon
Valley. William is a perfect example
of the type of positive outcome that
can come from the Stanford blend of
engineering, ingenuity and enter
prise in developing countries. Many
areas of the world are far worse off
than the United States and are in re
al need of the type of innovation and
technical expertise upon which the
Valley prides itself.
Armaan Ali characterizes the po
tential good that can come of this
kind of technological spread. Ar
maan is a current sophomore and in
ternational student at Stanford;
over the summer, he worked on an
organization that brought cheap
health care technology to those in
need in Bangladesh and Pakistan.
Visiting Armaan, I had the chance to
visit Dhaka, the capital of
Bangladesh, and the reality of the
Dhakan poor is truly astounding.
Dhaka, far from the airy hills of Palo
Alto, is grossly overpopulated and its
infant mortality rate is five and a half
times higher than that of the United
States. By bringing low-cost technol
ogy such as jaundice-fighting light
bulbs to the area, Armaan and his
colleagues opened up the possibility
of saving literally thousands of lives.
Stanford is not the only universi
ty whose students help people
across the globe. But certainly there
is a lot that students at well-heeled
universities such as Stanford take
for granted that could mean the dif
ference between life and death for
millions of people around the world.
The education that we get here is
incredible and could have lasting
impacts on developing countries.
Exchange programs are useful, but
spending four affordable years at
Stanford would be far more impor
tant and far more meaningful for

someone trying to learn skills that
will eventually save lives where they
live.
I think it is important to try to
foster the connection between what
is going on here and what is taking
place around the world. It is easy,
when trying to come up with the
"next big thing," to forget that half
of the world's population survives on
less than $3 a day. We must commit
ourselves to helping bridge the gap
by admitting more students from in
ternational backgrounds who would
otherwise miss out on the unique op
portunity that is Stanford.
This is but one of the reasons for
which I believe that admitting more
international students who come
from disadvantaged backgrounds
will yield great fruit. Appealing to
the culture of Silicon Valley, empiri
cally speaking, immigrants are dis
proportionately likely to become en
trepreneurs: think Elon Musk,
Sergei Brin, and Jan Koum. Immi
grants, according to Forbes maga
zine, founded more than 40% of the
Fortune 500 companies. Naturally,
not every international student is
going to come straight to university,
found a company or take up Ameri
can citizenship, but the point re
mains: international students em
body some of the core ideals of our
university.
William Kamkwamba, whose in
genuity should have been welcomed
by any university on the planet, end
ed up at Dartmouth University. We
are truly missing out on an incredi
ble opportunity to render our cam
pus more diverse and serve the en
tire world. Let's make sure that the
next generations of global entrepre
neurs are given a chance to try their
hands on The Farm. By working to
gether I believe we can convince the
University administration to give
this policy a second look.

ing that admit international stu
dents on a need-blind basis. For this
reason it is genuinely surprising
that despite the fact that Stanford
routinely the best fundraiser in
higher education raised a record
$1 billion dollars last year, it has yet
to open itself up to financing oppor

tunities for international students
without Social Security numbers.
Our university has been widely
characterized in popular media as
being a "Get Rich U" that feeds the
machine of innovation that is Silicon
Valley. William is a perfect example
of the type of positive outcome that
can come from the Stanford blend of
engineering, ingenuity and enter
prise in developing countries. Many
areas of the world are far worse off
than the United States and are in re
al need of the type of innovation and
technical expertise upon which the
Valley prides itself.
Armaan Ali characterizes the po
tential good that can come of this
kind of technological spread. Ar
maan is a current sophomore and in
ternational student at Stanford;
over the summer, he worked on an
organization that brought cheap
health care technology to those in
need in Bangladesh and Pakistan.
Visiting Armaan, I had the chance to
visit Dhaka, the capital of
Bangladesh, and the reality of the
Dhakan poor is truly astounding.
Dhaka, far from the airy hills of Palo
Alto, is grossly overpopulated and its
infant mortality rate is five and a half
times higher than that of the United
States. By bringing low-cost technol
ogy such as jaundice-fighting light
bulbs to the area, Armaan and his
colleagues opened up the possibility
of saving literally thousands of lives.
Stanford is not the only universi
ty whose students help people
across the globe. But certainly there
is a lot that students at well-heeled
universities such as Stanford take
for granted that could mean the dif
ference between life and death for
millions of people around the world.
The education that we get here is
incredible and could have lasting
impacts on developing countries.
Exchange programs are useful, but
spending four affordable years at
Stanford would be far more impor
tant and far more meaningful for

someone trying to learn skills that
will eventually save lives where they
live.
I think it is important to try to
foster the connection between what
is going on here and what is taking
place around the world. It is easy,
when trying to come up with the
"next big thing," to forget that half
of the world's population survives on
less than $3 a day. We must commit
ourselves to helping bridge the gap
by admitting more students from in
ternational backgrounds who would
otherwise miss out on the unique op
portunity that is Stanford.
This is but one of the reasons for
which I believe that admitting more
international students who come
from disadvantaged backgrounds
will yield great fruit. Appealing to
the culture of Silicon Valley, empiri
cally speaking, immigrants are dis
proportionately likely to become en
trepreneurs: think Elon Musk,
Sergei Brin, and Jan Koum. Immi
grants, according to Forbes maga
zine, founded more than 40% of the
Fortune 500 companies. Naturally,
not every international student is
going to come straight to university,
found a company or take up Ameri
can citizenship, but the point re
mains: international students em
body some of the core ideals of our
university.
William Kamkwamba, whose in
genuity should have been welcomed
by any university on the planet, end

are truly missing out on an incredi

next generations of global entrepre
neurs are given a chance to try their
hands on The Farm. By working to
gether I believe we can convince the
University administration to give
this policy a second look.

In 2002, William Kamkwamba
used bicycle parts, blue gum
tree and scraps to build a wind
mill in his village in Malawi. Only fif
teen, William nevertheless managed
to use the windmill to power several
electrical appliances in his village.
What is striking is that despite
William's lack of money, if William
had applied to Stanford he would
have been ineligible for financial aid.
Without financial aid, William's
inability to pay the full $42,000
would essentially disqualify him
from attending Stanford. Despite
our $lB billion endowment, we still
do not provide financial aid to inter
national students, even though oth
er top-tier universities such as Har
vard do.
Eleven percent of the under
graduate population at Stanford are
international students, all of whom
have had to find alternative ways of
funding their educations. Although
Stanford does not provide informa
tion on the number and source of its
international applications, it is evi
dent that an increase in financial aid
would undoubtedly make Stanford
an option for more students across
the world.
This marginalization of disad
vantaged international students
seems to be a rightable wrong.
