# SUPER TUESDAY
## Report Card: Obamacare 
### Nick Ahamed 
Yesterday was the last day to
enroll in health care without
also having to pay a tax
penalty for 2014.
That mile marker comes exactly
six months after Obamacare was
launched. How has it performed?
Here, I evaluate Obama's primary
legislative accomplishment's success
for students across communica
tion, functionality and accessibility.

Communication: B +
The Obama administration has
gone to great lengths to communi
cate deadlines for the law and to en
courage people to sign up. This
communication has been especially
targeted toward young people, as
the participation of young Ameri
cans is important to both Oba
macare's universality and its sol
vency. For example, in January,
popular actor Kal Penn published
an op-ed on http://www.barackoba
ma.com which targeted students
and other young people. Similarly,
the administration uses memes and
other internet phenomena which
are designed to drive engagement
with young people.
Many of you likely saw Presi
dent Obama's appearance on "Be
tween Two Ferns," which now has
almost four million You Tube views
and also trended on both Facebook
and Twitter. That video provided
more referrals than any other
source the day it was released.
Thus, for outreach, Obamacare is
performing exceedingly well.

However, messaging about the
law's purpose and scope could be
improved, as Jimmy Fallon humor
ously pointed out when Obamacare
was launched.
Obamacare is still unpopular ac
cording to the Kaiser Family Foun
dation, with 46 percent of Ameri
cans having an unfavorable opinion
and only 38 percent expressing a
favorable one.
However, Fallon's point that
the popular perception of Oba
macare suffers from insufficient
outreach is upheld by polling da
ta. The Kaiser Family Foundation
found that just over three-fourths
of the country knew that Oba
macare requires all Americans to
have health insurance or pay the
fine. This is surprising, considering
the individual mandate is the most
central and controversial compo
nent of Obamacare. Even fewer
people (63 percent) knew the law
provides subsidies for low-income
folks to purchase coverage. More
over, there is a clear mismatch be
tween popularity and knowledge.
More people favor aspects of Oba
macare (eight of nine important
parts of the law) than know that
those aspects are included.
The president must continue to
educate the public about the law.
Functionality: A
Despite the rocky rollout, the
law has had decent success getting
people health insurance. Politco re
ports that after yesterday, there
are expected to be seven million
sign-ups. As of last Wednesday,
there were six million. Three mil
lion people visited HealthCare.gov
by 8 p.m. on deadline day.
The data on young people for
March is not yet out. However, as of
February, individuals aged 18 to 34
made up a quarter of applicants.
This does not include young people
who can now stay on their parents'
plans until the age of 26.
Interestingly, health care ex
change policies are less popular
with young people than other, off
exchange policies. In fact, com
pared to the 25 percent figure cited
above, nearly 40 percent (the ad
ministration's goal) of individuals
buying off-exchange policies are
between the ages of 18 and 34, re
ports CNN.
Going off-exchange is important
to young people because doing so
will help keep prices down. But the
financial future of Obamacare rests
on the fact that young people, who
tend to be healthier, will balance
out people with pre-existing condi
tions. And the fewer young people
that sign up, the higher the burden
on those that do. Critically, the
American youth must be reminded

that a little sacrifice now will be re
paid years down the road.
However, these positive mark
ers have nevertheless been in line
with insurance companies' predic
tions. Blue Cross Blue Shield exec
utive Ken Goulet said, "I'm very
optimistic as to where we are."
Many companies are relying on the
high yield of youth off-exchange
policies. Cliff Gold, COO of
CoOportunity Health in Nebraska
stated: "We're very glad we didn't
rely exclusively on the exchanges.
It would have skewed the business
older and sicker and caused higher
rate increases."
Obamacare's mechanism is
working as it should; premiums are
not expected to rise because young
people are signing up.
Accessibility: B-
Obamacare's most vulnerable
traits are its technological woes.
Time and time again, its website,
www.HealthCare.gov, has gone
down (often because of too much
site traffic). For young people espe
cially, this is a huge letdown. Much
of our lives take place on the web,
and as students, the other re
sources to sign up for health care
in-person centers and phone ap
plications are much less prefer
able. Moreover, those sources too
have been plagued with difficulties.
Yesterday, likely because of the
deadline and heavy traffic, the
HealthCare.gov website had seri
ous glitches. As Politico writes:
"The federal website was down for
six hours early Monday morning.
Then it was up. Then it activated its
'virtual waiting room.' Then it
blocked newcomers from creating
accounts."
This could have financial conse
quences for individuals who tried to
sign up before the deadline but
were unable to. For an increasingly
tech-sawy world, and especially for
young people, the failings of
HealthCare.gov are a huge faux
pas that must continue to be im
proved. Nevertheless, the website
gets a B- because it's still handled a
massive number of sign-ups and
made insurance coverage possible
for millions.
Final Verdict: B +
Overall, the law is performing
well. American health care is much
better off now than it was in 2013.
The uninsured rate has continued
to fall and sign-ups are surging.
Nevertheless, there is still room for
improvement, especially in Oba
macare's online accessibility and
messaging.

and also trended on both Facebook
and Twitter. That video provided
more referrals than any other
source the day it was released.
Thus, for outreach, Obamacare is
performing exceedingly well.

However, messaging about the
law's purpose and scope could be
improved, as Jimmy Fallon humor
ously pointed out when Obamacare
was launched.
Obamacare is still unpopular ac
cording to the Kaiser Family Foun
dation, with 46 percent of Ameri
cans having an unfavorable opinion
and only 38 percent expressing a
favorable one.
However, Fallon's point that
the popular perception of Oba
macare suffers from insufficient
outreach is upheld by polling da
ta. The Kaiser Family Foundation
found that just over three-fourths
of the country knew that Oba
macare requires all Americans to
have health insurance or pay the
fine. This is surprising, considering
the individual mandate is the most
central and controversial compo
nent of Obamacare. Even fewer
people (63 percent) knew the law
provides subsidies for low-income
folks to purchase coverage. More
over, there is a clear mismatch be
tween popularity and knowledge.
More people favor aspects of Oba
macare (eight of nine important
parts of the law) than know that
those aspects are included.
The president must continue to
educate the public about the law.
Functionality: A
Despite the rocky rollout, the
law has had decent success getting
people health insurance. Politco re
ports that after yesterday, there
are expected to be seven million
sign-ups. As of last Wednesday,
there were six million. Three mil
lion people visited HealthCare.gov
by 8 p.m. on deadline day.
The data on young people for
March is not yet out. However, as of
February, individuals aged 18 to 34
made up a quarter of applicants.
This does not include young people
who can now stay on their parents'
plans until the age of 26.
Interestingly, health care ex
change policies are less popular
with young people than other, off
exchange policies. In fact, com
pared to the 25 percent figure cited
above, nearly 40 percent (the ad
ministration's goal) of individuals
buying off-exchange policies are
between the ages of 18 and 34, re
ports CNN.
Going off-exchange is important
to young people because doing so
will help keep prices down. But the
financial future of Obamacare rests
on the fact that young people, who
tend to be healthier, will balance
out people with pre-existing condi
tions. And the fewer young people
that sign up, the higher the burden
on those that do. Critically, the
American youth must be reminded

that a little sacrifice now will be re
paid years down the road.
However, these positive mark
ers have nevertheless been in line
with insurance companies' predic
tions. Blue Cross Blue Shield exec
utive Ken Goulet said, "I'm very
optimistic as to where we are."
Many companies are relying on the
high yield of youth off-exchange
policies. Cliff Gold, COO of
CoOportunity Health in Nebraska
stated: "We're very glad we didn't
rely exclusively on the exchanges.
It would have skewed the business
older and sicker and caused higher
rate increases."
Obamacare's mechanism is
working as it should; premiums are
not expected to rise because young
people are signing up.
Accessibility: B-
Obamacare's most vulnerable
traits are its technological woes.
Time and time again, its website,
www.HealthCare.gov, has gone
down (often because of too much
site traffic). For young people espe
cially, this is a huge letdown. Much
of our lives take place on the web,
and as students, the other re
sources to sign up for health care
in-person centers and phone ap
plications are much less prefer
able. Moreover, those sources too
have been plagued with difficulties.
Yesterday, likely because of the
deadline and heavy traffic, the
HealthCare.gov website had seri
ous glitches. As Politico writes:
"The federal website was down for
six hours early Monday morning.
Then it was up. Then it activated its
'virtual waiting room.' Then it
blocked newcomers from creating
accounts."
This could have financial conse
quences for individuals who tried to
sign up before the deadline but
were unable to. For an increasingly
tech-sawy world, and especially for
young people, the failings of
HealthCare.gov are a huge faux
pas that must continue to be im
proved. Nevertheless, the website
gets a B- because it's still handled a
massive number of sign-ups and
made insurance coverage possible
for millions.
Final Verdict: B +
Overall, the law is performing
well. American health care is much
better off now than it was in 2013.
The uninsured rate has continued
to fall and sign-ups are surging.
Nevertheless, there is still room for
improvement, especially in Oba
macare's online accessibility and
messaging.

Yesterday was the last day to
enroll in health care without
also having to pay a tax
penalty for 2014.
That mile marker comes exactly
six months after Obamacare was
launched. How has it performed?

The Obama administration has
gone to great lengths to communi
cate deadlines for the law and to en
courage people to sign up. This
communication has been especially
targeted toward young people, as
the participation of young Ameri
cans is important to both Oba
macare's universality and its sol
vency. For example, in January,
popular actor Kal Penn published
an op-ed on http://www.barackoba
ma.com which targeted students
and other young people. Similarly,
the administration uses memes and
other internet phenomena which
are designed to drive engagement
with young people.
Many of you likely saw Presi
dent Obama's appearance on "Be
tween Two Ferns," which now has
almost four million You Tube views
and also trended on both Facebook
and Twitter. That video provided
