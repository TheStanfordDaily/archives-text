# TROJANS TOPPLED
## Card hand USC first loss of season 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
The 2014 women's water polo
season was again expected to con
clude in a hard-fought battle be
tween USC and Stanford for the
national championship after a
star-studded Cardinal squad was
felled in a four-overtime heart
breaker in last season's NCAA ti
tle match.

Despite a stumble for No. 3
Stanford (16-1, 2-0 MPSF) at the
UCI Invitational earlier this sea
son, expectations of a champi
onship meeting of the powerhouse
teams were vindicated, with the
Cardinal barreling through its

schedule and No. 1 USC extend
ing a winning streak that started
last season to 27 matches. On Sun
day at Avery Aquatic Center, the
Cardinal emphatically snapped
the Trojans' (20-1, 5-1) streak as
Stanford rode its exceptional de
fense to a 9-5 victory over the top
ranked team in the country.
With a Trojan offense that had
been averaging 15.9 goals per
match and a Stanford defense that
had only been allowing six per
match colliding in the pool, some
thing had to give. And what gave
on Sunday was the Trojan offense,
which the Cardinal defense stifled
and held to only five goals during
the match.
Sophomore goalie Gabby Stone
set a new career high with 17
saves, while the Cardinal defense
buckled down to allow just two
goals after the half.
While the USC offense scuffled
throughout the match, Stanford
was able to take advantage of a
six-goal run spanning halftime to
take an 8-3 lead that it would nev
er look back from in the third peri
od. Junior driver Cory Dodson

shared the team lead with two
goals in the match and began the
Cardinal's run with a goal to tie
the game at 3 apiece and capping
it off with a 3-on-2 goal to give the
Cardinal a five-score advantage.
Sophomore driver Maggie
Steffens also contributed two
goals, including one in the first pe
riod as the Cardinal jumped out to
an early 2-0 lead, to share the
team lead in scoring.
The Cardinal will continue a
tough stretch to close out its regu
lar season as it moves forward in
to matchups against No. 5 Arizona
State and No. 2 UCLA, both of
which gave Stanford difficult
matches in their last meetings
with the Cardinal. While Arizona
State fell just short of the upset as
Stanford prevailed 11-10, UCLA
was able to pull off the victory to
hand Stanford its only defeat of
the season.
Stanford will take on the Sun
Devils at Avery Aquatic Center on
Saturday at 1 p.m.
