# Office of Admissions to bring admit rate to standstill

### â€“ Alita N'winning 
The Office of Undergrad
uate Admission announced
earlier this month that it
plans to gradually cut the
University's admit rate over
time until eventually attain
ing a rate of zero percent.
The plan, appropriately
dubbed "#WinningUS-
News," will continue a con
sistent downward trend in
Stanford's admit rates and
will take approximately one
decade to complete.
"It's a work of genius,"
said a University admissions
officer who asked not to be
identified. "Because none of
the nation's other top
schools will see it coming.
Bam we got 'em."

"This new admissions
plan truly embodies the spir
it of innovation we promote
here at Stanford," added a
colleague. "It's unlike any
thing the world of higher ed
ucation has ever seen."
When asked what the
University will do after ad
missions comes to a stand
still, the colleague declined
to offer specifics, instead
shrugging his shoulders.

"Die Luft der Freiheit
weht wherever the wind
of freedom takes me," he
replied, grinning.
A complete overhaul of
the "holistic admissions
process" will accompany the
decrease in admit rates, with
alterations to the current
process having been piloted
in recent years.
"The lottery system
won't be that different from
the ultimately planned selec
tion process," the admissions
source reassured The Daily.
