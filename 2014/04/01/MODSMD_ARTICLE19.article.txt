### – Claire Net 
After cowbell player Alex
Chang 'l4 shot to fame last

week on the back of his vig
orous performances during
Stanford men's basketball's
run to the Sweet Sixteen, er
hu player Joe Smith 'l4 ex
pressed anger at the lack of
recognition he has received
for his dynamic role in the
Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity Marching Band.
According to Smith, he
has been consistently placed
in the back of the band

behind even the tuba play
ers— and generally over
looked by his peers.

"Joe Smith? Doesn't
sound familiar," said trum
pet player Cathy Greenwald
'l6. "What instrument does
he play?"

Smith noted that most
friends refuse to believe that
he is part of the Band, and
that his attempts to describe
his instrument— a violin
like Chinese instrument
with two strings and a bow
are generally met with
blank stares.

"It gives that oriental
feel to all of our pieces,"
Smith explained. "It's also
very versatile. I can play
anything from the Stanford
fight song to Taylor Swift's
'22.'"

Smith also objected to
the fact that despite the
overpowering prominence of
Chang's instrument, the
conductor always asks for
"more cowbell."

"The cowbell just drowns
everyone else out," Smith
said. "No one ever says 'I
could've used a little more
erhu.'"

To help bring awareness
about his role, Smith is plan
ning the Band's next gig,
which has been scheduled
for the Stanford Dragonboat
team's next race.
