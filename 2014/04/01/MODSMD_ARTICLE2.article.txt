# Jasper Ridge elicits lawsuit
## Environmental groups sue Stanford for endangering trout 
### KYLIE JUE DESK EDITOR 
After a Feb. 28 court-ordered inspection of the Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve, two environmental groups filed a lawsuit
on Mar. 11 against the National Marine Fisheries Service
(NMFS) for allegedly allowing Stanford University to endanger
steelhead trout.
The lawsuit refers to two of Stanford's water diversions
downstream of the Searsville Dam that provide irrigation for a
golf course and other campus landscaping. Our Children's
Earth Foundation and the Ecological Rights Foundation had
previously sued Stanford in Jan. 2013, in a lawsuit that is cur
rently in the discovery phase. Both foundations are part of a net
work of Northern California environmental groups.
"In recent years [we] have gotten increasingly interested in
endangered species protection," said Christopher Sproul, lead
attorney for the plaintiffs and a member of both organizations.
"Steelhead and endangered species like that are the canaries
in the coal mine. If water quality and environmental quality
are not being maintained, they're kind of the first to really see
effects."
The allegations
According to Sproul, the Searsville Dam blocks the flow of
water that steelhead trout need, thus harming the fish and vio-

The creek bed of Corte Madera Creek, a tributary of the San Francisquito Creek, has become mostly jagged rock that
does not provide suitable breeding grounds for the endangered steelhead trout in Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve.
