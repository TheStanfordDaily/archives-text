# Jasper Ridge elicits lawsuit
## Environmental groups sue Stanford for endangering trout 
### KYLIE JUE DESK EDITOR 
After a Feb. 28 court-ordered inspection of the Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve, two environmental groups filed a lawsuit
on Mar. 11 against the National Marine Fisheries Service
(NMFS) for allegedly allowing Stanford University to endanger
steelhead trout.
The lawsuit refers to two of Stanford's water diversions
downstream of the Searsville Dam that provide irrigation for a
golf course and other campus landscaping. Our Children's
Earth Foundation and the Ecological Rights Foundation had
previously sued Stanford in Jan. 2013, in a lawsuit that is cur
rently in the discovery phase. Both foundations are part of a net
work of Northern California environmental groups.
"In recent years [we] have gotten increasingly interested in
endangered species protection," said Christopher Sproul, lead
attorney for the plaintiffs and a member of both organizations.
"Steelhead and endangered species like that are the canaries
in the coal mine. If water quality and environmental quality
are not being maintained, they're kind of the first to really see
effects."

lating the Endangered
Species Act.
"We've claimed that
Searsville Dam and Searsville
Reservoir have the effect of
doing substantial damage to
the shape and composition of
the creek bed below Searsville
Dam in away that renders it
less suitable for steelhead,"
Sproul said. "We were taking
measurements to confirm
that, and we did [confirm that
effect]."
In its current state, the
creek bed consists of mostly
jagged rock, lacking the grav
el that steelhead use for
spawning. Sproul also ex
plained that the trout were
spawning at the time of the in
spection and that adult steel
head are currently present in
the San Francisco Bay.
In addition to the lack of
good breeding terrain in the
lower section of San Francis
quito Creek, the Searsville
Dam also prevents sufficient
freshwater from reaching the
bay. The fish sense the pres
ence of freshwater, which sig
nals them to swim upstream
to spawn.
"By blocking the flow in
Corte Madero Creek, Stan
ford is reducing that [freshwa
ter] clue and making it less
likely that there's going to be
healthy return of steelhead
this year in the San Francis
quito Creek," Sproul said.
However, the organiza
tions did not find any sedi
ment pollution during then* in
spections, which they claimed
was probably due to the dry
weather. Flushing sediment
into the creek only occurs
when the reservoir is full. The
claim that Stanford was vio
lating the Clean Water Act is
still under investigation.
"When Stanford is actively
pumping water out of the
reservoir, the pipelines tend to
get clogged with sediment,
and then they flush the sedi
ment out into the creek,"
Sproul said. "That's in Stan
ford's own documents."

Stanford's response
Although the organiza
tions' inspection tour was led
by Jasper Ridge biologists,
Sproul said that the Stanford
scientists did not comment on

fornia office of American
Rivers, options to help the en
dangered fish include provid
ing the steelhead with access
to spawning habitat upstream
of the dam, allowing water
passage through the dam dur
ing dry summer months and
planting vegetation to stabi
lize the creek's banks down
stream.
"There is approximately
20 miles of historic habitat
that is considered in good con
dition upstream of the dam
that they can't now get to,"
Rothert said.
However, Rothert also ex
plained that since San Fran
cisquito Creek acts as a
boundary between San Mateo
County and Santa Clara
County the creek has actually
remained in relatively good
condition. According to
Rothert, many other Bay
Area streams have been lay
ered with concrete to serve as
flood channels.
According to Rothert, al
though American Rivers was
asked to join Our Children's
Earth Foundation and the
Ecological Rights Foundation
as a co-litigant, the organiza
tion declined to join the law
suit against Stanford.
'American Rivers is an ac
tive member of the advisory
group that is an official part of
Stanford's Searsville Alterna
tives Study process," Rothert
said. "The Searsville Alterna
tive Study process was get
ting underway, and we wanted
to remain active and construc
tive in that process and not be
distracted by litigation."
Rothert suggested that
the water resources the dam
provides could be replaced en
tirely by Stanford's already
existing downstream diver
sions. He applauded the Uni
versity's efforts to further in
vestigate other water supply
options through the Searsville
Alternatives Study.
Associate Professor of Civ
il and Environmental Engi
neering David Freyberg M.S.
'77 Ph.D. 'Bl has been in
volved in research at Jasper
Ridge for many years, serving
on both the Jasper Ridge Ad
visory Committee and the
Searsville Alternatives Study
group.

FYeyberg explained that
researchers are currently
gathering information about
the many potential outcomes
for the dam, and the formal

analysis of alternatives has
been ongoing for over a year.
"There are a number of
different ways that fish can
get by a dam," Freyberg said.
"The most common scenario
is to construct an artificial
channel that goes around the
dam. It has t0... be at a flat
enough slope so the fish can
swim up."
However, Freyberg ex
plained that the solutions are
not one-sided. Installing a
passage for fish around the
dam would require controlling
the water flow at all times to
prevent floods. Sediment has
accumulated behind the dam,
complicating any effort to re
move the dam entirely.
"There are three regions
in which we need to under
stand the impacts of change:
flow of water and sediment
and the consequences for both
people and other organisms,"
Freyberg said.
Although no firm deadline
for finding a solution has been
set, researchers hope to de
termine a promising option
soon.
"The committee has been
charged with reporting to the
administration... either late
this year [or] early next year,"
Freyberg said.
"I certainly don't have a
clear idea of how all the trade
offs are going to play out, and
so I think we have a ways to
go before it will be clearer
what alternatives are the
most viable," he added. "It's
still an open question."
Where the lawsuit will go
Sproul explained that al
though settlement has been
discussed, the parties have
not reached an agreement. If
no informal resolution can be
reached, the next step will be
to ask a judge to issue a deci
sion in the case.
"We've had settlement dis
cussions with Stanford but we
didn't get anywhere," Sproul
said. "We would like to settle if
we can get something reason
able for the fish, but so far in
our view, Stanford is not being
reasonable."
Professor of Environmen
tal Law and Director of the
Environmental Law Clinic
Deborah Sivas J.D. 'B7, who
represented the organization
Spawn in a similar litigation
against Marin County, shared
her perspective on the
Searsville Dam case.

"If the plaintiffs were suc
cessful and the court found
that they were correct, the
court would typically order
[Stanford] to go seek a per
mit," Sivas said. "It gets a lit
tle tricky; it goes back to the
agency to determine if a per
mit was appropriate. The
agency would then have to de
termine if the species is truly
endangered."
Sivas believed it would be
unlikely for Stanford to be re
quired to tear down Searsville
Dam. She explained that
foothill erosion has created a
new marsh-like ecosystem due
to the buildup of silt at the
base of the dam. Removing it
would negatively affect Jasper
Ridge wildlife, she said.
"The NMFS typically
wouldn't make anyone take
down the dam," Sivas said.
"More likely the NMFS
would make Stanford cut back
on water to be taken out of the
dam or figure out away to al
low fish to move beyond the
dam."
Sivas predicted that the
parties will settle and that the
case is not likely to go to trial.
"Courts have not been that
receptive to these cases,"
Sivas said. "Some have been
able to win, but I don't know
[the organizations'] evidence
on harm to the species ... I
suspect this case will not go to
trial, but I suspect there will
be a potential settlement."
Sproul spoke about what
Our Children's Earth and the
Ecological Rights Foundation
want to see from the lawsuit.
"In the short term, we'd
like to see Stanford stop di
verting water out of the local
creeks or at least substantial
ly cut back diversion," Sproul
said. "We would like to see
Stanford do some habitat
restoration."
In the long term, the or
ganizations want the Univer
sity to provide the trout with a
path around Searsville Dam,
regardless of whether that in
volves constructing a passage
through or around the dam or
removing it all together.
"We're still continuing to
do discovery, to get as much
information as we can,"
Sproul said. "In the near fu
ture, we'll be bringing motions
to try to get some relief for the
fish."

freshwater from reaching the
bay. The fish sense the pres
ence of freshwater, which sig
nals them to swim upstream
to spawn.
"By blocking the flow in
Corte Madero Creek, Stan
ford is reducing that [freshwa
ter] clue and making it less
likely that there's going to be
healthy return of steelhead
this year in the San Francis
quito Creek," Sproul said.
However, the organiza
tions did not find any sedi
ment pollution during then* in
spections, which they claimed
was probably due to the dry
weather. Flushing sediment
into the creek only occurs
when the reservoir is full. The
claim that Stanford was vio
lating the Clean Water Act is
still under investigation.
"When Stanford is actively
pumping water out of the
reservoir, the pipelines tend to
get clogged with sediment,
and then they flush the sedi
ment out into the creek,"
Sproul said. "That's in Stan
ford's own documents."

Stanford's response
Although the organiza
tions' inspection tour was led
by Jasper Ridge biologists,
Sproul said that the Stanford
scientists did not comment on

fornia office of American
Rivers, options to help the en
dangered fish include provid
ing the steelhead with access
to spawning habitat upstream
of the dam, allowing water
passage through the dam dur
ing dry summer months and
planting vegetation to stabi
lize the creek's banks down
stream.
"There is approximately
20 miles of historic habitat
that is considered in good con
dition upstream of the dam
that they can't now get to,"
Rothert said.
However, Rothert also ex
plained that since San Fran
cisquito Creek acts as a
boundary between San Mateo
County and Santa Clara
County the creek has actually
remained in relatively good
condition. According to
Rothert, many other Bay
Area streams have been lay
ered with concrete to serve as
flood channels.
According to Rothert, al
though American Rivers was
asked to join Our Children's
Earth Foundation and the
Ecological Rights Foundation
as a co-litigant, the organiza
tion declined to join the law
suit against Stanford.
'American Rivers is an ac
tive member of the advisory
group that is an official part of
Stanford's Searsville Alterna
tives Study process," Rothert
said. "The Searsville Alterna
tive Study process was get
ting underway, and we wanted
to remain active and construc
tive in that process and not be
distracted by litigation."
Rothert suggested that
the water resources the dam
provides could be replaced en
tirely by Stanford's already
existing downstream diver
sions. He applauded the Uni
versity's efforts to further in
vestigate other water supply
options through the Searsville
Alternatives Study.
Associate Professor of Civ
il and Environmental Engi
neering David Freyberg M.S.
'77 Ph.D. 'Bl has been in
volved in research at Jasper
Ridge for many years, serving
on both the Jasper Ridge Ad
visory Committee and the
Searsville Alternatives Study
group.

FYeyberg explained that
researchers are currently
gathering information about
the many potential outcomes
for the dam, and the formal

analysis of alternatives has
been ongoing for over a year.
"There are a number of
different ways that fish can
get by a dam," Freyberg said.
"The most common scenario
is to construct an artificial
channel that goes around the
dam. It has t0... be at a flat
enough slope so the fish can
swim up."
However, Freyberg ex
plained that the solutions are
not one-sided. Installing a
passage for fish around the
dam would require controlling
the water flow at all times to
prevent floods. Sediment has
accumulated behind the dam,
complicating any effort to re
move the dam entirely.
"There are three regions
in which we need to under
stand the impacts of change:
flow of water and sediment
and the consequences for both
people and other organisms,"
Freyberg said.
Although no firm deadline
for finding a solution has been
set, researchers hope to de
termine a promising option
soon.
"The committee has been
charged with reporting to the
administration... either late
this year [or] early next year,"
Freyberg said.
"I certainly don't have a
clear idea of how all the trade
offs are going to play out, and
so I think we have a ways to
go before it will be clearer
what alternatives are the
most viable," he added. "It's
still an open question."
Where the lawsuit will go
Sproul explained that al
though settlement has been
discussed, the parties have
not reached an agreement. If
no informal resolution can be
reached, the next step will be
to ask a judge to issue a deci
sion in the case.
"We've had settlement dis
cussions with Stanford but we
didn't get anywhere," Sproul
said. "We would like to settle if
we can get something reason
able for the fish, but so far in
our view, Stanford is not being
reasonable."
Professor of Environmen
tal Law and Director of the
Environmental Law Clinic
Deborah Sivas J.D. 'B7, who
represented the organization
Spawn in a similar litigation
against Marin County, shared
her perspective on the
Searsville Dam case.

"If the plaintiffs were suc
cessful and the court found
that they were correct, the
court would typically order
[Stanford] to go seek a per
mit," Sivas said. "It gets a lit
tle tricky; it goes back to the
agency to determine if a per
mit was appropriate. The
agency would then have to de
termine if the species is truly
endangered."
Sivas believed it would be
unlikely for Stanford to be re
quired to tear down Searsville
Dam. She explained that
foothill erosion has created a
new marsh-like ecosystem due
to the buildup of silt at the
base of the dam. Removing it
would negatively affect Jasper
Ridge wildlife, she said.
"The NMFS typically
wouldn't make anyone take
down the dam," Sivas said.
"More likely the NMFS
would make Stanford cut back
on water to be taken out of the
dam or figure out away to al
low fish to move beyond the
dam."
Sivas predicted that the
parties will settle and that the
case is not likely to go to trial.
"Courts have not been that
receptive to these cases,"
Sivas said. "Some have been
able to win, but I don't know
[the organizations'] evidence
on harm to the species ... I
suspect this case will not go to
trial, but I suspect there will
be a potential settlement."
Sproul spoke about what
Our Children's Earth and the
Ecological Rights Foundation
want to see from the lawsuit.
"In the short term, we'd
like to see Stanford stop di
verting water out of the local
creeks or at least substantial
ly cut back diversion," Sproul
said. "We would like to see
Stanford do some habitat
restoration."
In the long term, the or
ganizations want the Univer
sity to provide the trout with a
path around Searsville Dam,
regardless of whether that in
volves constructing a passage
through or around the dam or
removing it all together.
"We're still continuing to
do discovery, to get as much
information as we can,"
Sproul said. "In the near fu
ture, we'll be bringing motions
to try to get some relief for the
fish."

After a Feb. 28 court-ordered inspection of the Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve, two environmental groups filed a lawsuit
on Mar. 11 against the National Marine Fisheries Service
(NMFS) for allegedly allowing Stanford University to endanger
steelhead trout.
The lawsuit refers to two of Stanford's water diversions
downstream of the Searsville Dam that provide irrigation for a
golf course and other campus landscaping. Our Children's
Earth Foundation and the Ecological Rights Foundation had
previously sued Stanford in Jan. 2013, in a lawsuit that is cur
rently in the discovery phase. Both foundations are part of a net
work of Northern California environmental groups.
"In recent years [we] have gotten increasingly interested in
endangered species protection," said Christopher Sproul, lead
attorney for the plaintiffs and a member of both organizations.
"Steelhead and endangered species like that are the canaries
in the coal mine. If water quality and environmental quality
are not being maintained, they're kind of the first to really see
effects."

lating the Endangered
Species Act.
"We've claimed that
Searsville Dam and Searsville
Reservoir have the effect of
doing substantial damage to
the shape and composition of
the creek bed below Searsville
Dam in away that renders it
less suitable for steelhead,"
Sproul said. "We were taking
measurements to confirm
that, and we did [confirm that
effect]."
In its current state, the
creek bed consists of mostly
jagged rock, lacking the grav
el that steelhead use for
spawning. Sproul also ex
plained that the trout were
spawning at the time of the in
spection and that adult steel
head are currently present in
the San Francisco Bay.
In addition to the lack of
good breeding terrain in the
lower section of San Francis
quito Creek, the Searsville
Dam also prevents sufficient
freshwater from reaching the
bay. The fish sense the pres

'American Rivers is an ac

to remain active and construc

distracted by litigation."
Rothert suggested that
the water resources the dam

'77 Ph.D. 'Bl has been in
volved in research at Jasper
Ridge for many years, serving
on both the Jasper Ridge Ad
visory Committee and the
Searsville Alternatives Study
group.

FYeyberg explained that
researchers are currently
gathering information about
the many potential outcomes
for the dam, and the formal

analysis of alternatives has
been ongoing for over a year.
"There are a number of
different ways that fish can
get by a dam," Freyberg said.
"The most common scenario
is to construct an artificial
channel that goes around the
dam. It has t0... be at a flat
enough slope so the fish can
swim up."
However, Freyberg ex
plained that the solutions are
not one-sided. Installing a
passage for fish around the
dam would require controlling
the water flow at all times to
prevent floods. Sediment has
accumulated behind the dam,
complicating any effort to re
move the dam entirely.
"There are three regions
in which we need to under
stand the impacts of change:
flow of water and sediment
and the consequences for both
people and other organisms,"
Freyberg said.
Although no firm deadline
for finding a solution has been
set, researchers hope to de
termine a promising option
soon.
"The committee has been
charged with reporting to the
administration... either late
this year [or] early next year,"
Freyberg said.
"I certainly don't have a
clear idea of how all the trade
offs are going to play out, and
so I think we have a ways to
go before it will be clearer
what alternatives are the
most viable," he added. "It's
still an open question."
Where the lawsuit will go
Sproul explained that al
though settlement has been
discussed, the parties have
not reached an agreement. If
no informal resolution can be
reached, the next step will be
to ask a judge to issue a deci
sion in the case.
"We've had settlement dis
cussions with Stanford but we
didn't get anywhere," Sproul
said. "We would like to settle if
we can get something reason
able for the fish, but so far in
our view, Stanford is not being
reasonable."
Professor of Environmen
tal Law and Director of the
Environmental Law Clinic
Deborah Sivas J.D. 'B7, who
represented the organization
Spawn in a similar litigation
against Marin County, shared
her perspective on the
Searsville Dam case.

"If the plaintiffs were suc
cessful and the court found
that they were correct, the
court would typically order
[Stanford] to go seek a per
mit," Sivas said. "It gets a lit
tle tricky; it goes back to the
agency to determine if a per
mit was appropriate. The
agency would then have to de
termine if the species is truly
endangered."
Sivas believed it would be
unlikely for Stanford to be re
quired to tear down Searsville
Dam. She explained that
foothill erosion has created a
new marsh-like ecosystem due
to the buildup of silt at the
base of the dam. Removing it
would negatively affect Jasper
Ridge wildlife, she said.
"The NMFS typically
wouldn't make anyone take
down the dam," Sivas said.
"More likely the NMFS
would make Stanford cut back
on water to be taken out of the
dam or figure out away to al
low fish to move beyond the
dam."
Sivas predicted that the
parties will settle and that the
case is not likely to go to trial.
"Courts have not been that
receptive to these cases,"
Sivas said. "Some have been
able to win, but I don't know
[the organizations'] evidence
on harm to the species ... I
suspect this case will not go to
trial, but I suspect there will
be a potential settlement."
Sproul spoke about what
Our Children's Earth and the
Ecological Rights Foundation
want to see from the lawsuit.
"In the short term, we'd
like to see Stanford stop di
verting water out of the local
creeks or at least substantial
ly cut back diversion," Sproul
said. "We would like to see
Stanford do some habitat
restoration."
In the long term, the or
ganizations want the Univer
sity to provide the trout with a
path around Searsville Dam,
regardless of whether that in
volves constructing a passage
through or around the dam or
removing it all together.
"We're still continuing to
do discovery, to get as much
information as we can,"
Sproul said. "In the near fu
ture, we'll be bringing motions
to try to get some relief for the
fish."

After a Feb. 28 court-ordered inspection of the Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve, two environmental groups filed a lawsuit
on Mar. 11 against the National Marine Fisheries Service
(NMFS) for allegedly allowing Stanford University to endanger
steelhead trout.
The lawsuit refers to two of Stanford's water diversions
downstream of the Searsville Dam that provide irrigation for a
golf course and other campus landscaping. Our Children's
Earth Foundation and the Ecological Rights Foundation had
previously sued Stanford in Jan. 2013, in a lawsuit that is cur
rently in the discovery phase. Both foundations are part of a net
work of Northern California environmental groups.
"In recent years [we] have gotten increasingly interested in
endangered species protection," said Christopher Sproul, lead
attorney for the plaintiffs and a member of both organizations.
"Steelhead and endangered species like that are the canaries
in the coal mine. If water quality and environmental quality
are not being maintained, they're kind of the first to really see
effects."
The allegations
According to Sproul, the Searsville Dam blocks the flow of
water that steelhead trout need, thus harming the fish and vio-

The creek bed of Corte Madera Creek, a tributary of the San Francisquito Creek, has become mostly jagged rock that
does not provide suitable breeding grounds for the endangered steelhead trout in Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve.
lating the Endangered
Species Act.
"We've claimed that
Searsville Dam and Searsville
Reservoir have the effect of
doing substantial damage to
the shape and composition of
the creek bed below Searsville
Dam in away that renders it
less suitable for steelhead,"
Sproul said. "We were taking
measurements to confirm
that, and we did [confirm that
effect]."
In its current state, the
creek bed consists of mostly
jagged rock, lacking the grav
el that steelhead use for
spawning. Sproul also ex
plained that the trout were
spawning at the time of the in
spection and that adult steel
head are currently present in
the San Francisco Bay.
In addition to the lack of
good breeding terrain in the
lower section of San Francis
quito Creek, the Searsville
Dam also prevents sufficient
freshwater from reaching the
bay. The fish sense the pres
ence of freshwater, which sig
nals them to swim upstream
to spawn.
"By blocking the flow in
Corte Madero Creek, Stan
ford is reducing that [freshwa
ter] clue and making it less
likely that there's going to be
healthy return of steelhead
this year in the San Francis
quito Creek," Sproul said.
However, the organiza
tions did not find any sedi
ment pollution during then* in
spections, which they claimed
was probably due to the dry
weather. Flushing sediment
into the creek only occurs
when the reservoir is full. The
claim that Stanford was vio
lating the Clean Water Act is
still under investigation.
"When Stanford is actively
pumping water out of the
reservoir, the pipelines tend to
get clogged with sediment,
and then they flush the sedi
ment out into the creek,"
Sproul said. "That's in Stan
ford's own documents."

Stanford's response
Although the organiza
tions' inspection tour was led
by Jasper Ridge biologists,
Sproul said that the Stanford
scientists did not comment on

fornia office of American
Rivers, options to help the en
dangered fish include provid
ing the steelhead with access
to spawning habitat upstream
of the dam, allowing water
passage through the dam dur
ing dry summer months and
planting vegetation to stabi
lize the creek's banks down
stream.
"There is approximately
20 miles of historic habitat
that is considered in good con
dition upstream of the dam
that they can't now get to,"
Rothert said.
However, Rothert also ex
plained that since San Fran
cisquito Creek acts as a
boundary between San Mateo
County and Santa Clara
County the creek has actually
remained in relatively good
condition. According to
Rothert, many other Bay
Area streams have been lay
ered with concrete to serve as
flood channels.
According to Rothert, al
though American Rivers was
asked to join Our Children's
Earth Foundation and the
Ecological Rights Foundation
as a co-litigant, the organiza
tion declined to join the law
suit against Stanford.
'American Rivers is an ac
tive member of the advisory
