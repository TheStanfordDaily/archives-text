## Epicenter student fellows visit Stanford 
### KYLIE JUE DESK EDITOR 
From Mar. 20 to Mar. 22, 88 stu
dents from colleges across the coun
try visited Stanford and Silicon Val
ley through the National Center of
Engineering Pathways to Innova
tion (Epicenter)'s University Inno
vation Fellows program to learn
about entrepreneurship and innova
tion through hands-on designing,
listening to speakers and even danc

ing.
Goals of the program
Funded by the National Science
Foundation, Epicenter is directed
by Stanford University and the Na
tional Collegiate Inventors and In
novators Alliance (NCIIA). The
Epicenter promotes innovation in
undergraduate education, and its
University Innovation Fellows pro
gram aims to train students to "be
come leaders who catalyze change"
at their schools.

"We believe very strongly that
engineers cannot graduate with just
excellent technical skills," said Leti
cia Britos Cavagnaro Ph.D. 'll,
deputy director of Epicenter. "They
also need to graduate with skills to
identify and create opportunities."
"Specifically, we feel students are
key players to shaping their own ed
ucations," she added. "They are
change agents to shaping not only
their education but [also] the Uni
versity."
Britos Cavagnaro explained that
the program began on a much small
er scale in an effort by the NCIIA
four years ago.
"We worked together and re
vamped it completely. We changed
the philosophy," Britos Cavagnaro
said. "Now we are tasking the stu
dents to be more strategic
thinkers. They are to analyze their
schools' landscapes and what
changes they want to make in their
own school."
Fellows are selected through an
application process and must be
sponsored by a faculty member.
Each year, the Epicenter supports
two cohorts of fellows: one in the
spring and one in the fall. Following
acceptance into the program, stu
dents must complete six weeks of
online training using the massive
open online course platform
NovoEd.

The Epicenter's University Innovation Fellows took part in a design
challenge at Google last month during their visit to Stanford campus.
"Each week there is an
assignment... For example
they have to [perform] land
scape analysis of them cam
pus, talk with a past fellow or
[have] a set of calls with a
training coordinator," Britos
Cavagnaro said. 'After train
ing they are off to imple
menting then* plan at their
campus. We have monthly
status calls and sharing."
Scaling the program
Since its inception in Aug.
2012, the program has seen
significant growth.
"We started with 10 [fel
lows] the first semester, and
last semester we doubled to
20," said Humera Fasihud
din, senior program officer
for the University Innovation
Fellows. "This semester we
accepted 74 students."
According to Fasihuddin,
the fellows who have partici
pated in the program have
generally proven successful.
Their efforts have included
TEDx events, design teams
and new innovation spaces.
"Faculty embrace the pro
grams," Fasihuddin said.
"For example, we have 70
students shadowing physi
cians. That resulted in four
patents in biomedical engi
neering... We've seen stu
dents being able to make
substantial differences."
Fasihuddin also explained
that the program is piloting
leadership circles for groups
of four or five fellows from
the same school to go
through training together
and have a more rapid impact
on their universities.
In future years, Epicen
ter hopes to continue expand
ing the program to even
more colleges, with an objec
tive of reaching 200 engineer
ing schools in the U.S. by
2016.
"[At that point] Epicenter
would reach a tipping point in
the engineering field," Fasi
huddin said.
Student takeaways
Both new and old fellows
spoke about how they bene
fited by coming together and

exchanging ideas over the
course of four days.
Jared Karp, a UC-Berke
ley senior studying mechani
cal engineering, shared his
story of creating the Design
Engineering Collaborative
on campus, as well as receiv
ing $2O million in funding to
build a design institute at
Berkeley.
"My favorite part of this is
the students. It is so clear
that this is a profound collec
tion of leaders who can ac
complish anything," Karp
said. "In our everyday lives,
there are a lot of people who
are not doers. In our every
day lives, we have to navigate
whatever ecosystem we are
in. But here anything is pos
sible."
"It is so electrifying and
refreshing and exciting to be
around each other," he
added. "I have never been a
part of something like this.
Students are the drivers of
real change."
Natalia von Windheim, a
sophomore at North Carolina
State University and a Uni
versity Innovation Fellow
candidate this spring, ex
plained that the event al
lowed her to find new ways to
innovate beyond participat
ing in existing entrepreneur
ship efforts on her campus.
Ben Riddle, a current
candidate who attends Fur
man University, has worked
to create new courses at his
school and to promote the
presence of design thinking
in social entrepreneurship on
his campus.
"You think you're alone
until you meet everybody
else and realize that there's
tons of us out there shifting
the culture of institutions
from the inside out," Riddle
said. "I think it's a huge op
portunity."
Fasihuddin explained that
they plan to hold a similar
conference every year to con
tinue bringing together a
growing number of fellows.
"The time is now for these
students to transform," Fasi
huddin said. "Every individ
ual can be a leader. We can't
change where we came from,
but everyone can make their
own impact."

Bradley Hayward '92,
Stanford's senior director of
strategic communications,
provided a written statement
regarding the litigation.
"The filing of a lawsuit
does not mean that the allega
tions are true," Hayward
wrote. "The National Marine
Fisheries Service conducted a
thorough evaluation and is
sued permits for Stanford
that do not harm and in fact
benefit the fish in Los Trancos
Creek and the San Francis
quito watershed."
Hayward also explained
that the University has con
structed a fish ladder to facili
tate steelhead migration up
Los Trancos Creek, one of the
San Francisquito Creek's trib
utaries. NMFS approved the
construction of this ladder and
Stanford's proposed water di
versions in 2008.
"It was the result of a mul
ti-year [sic] process involving
careful analysis and evalua
tion of the project," Hayward
said. "Specific minimum flows
in the creek are required by
NMFS, for the benefit of
steelhead, before Stanford
can divert water. Upstream
migration is not blocked, and
in fact the Steelhead En
hancement Project (SHEP)
created more effective up
stream migration."
"The University is com
mitted to conserving habitats
for protected species and is in
full compliance with the En
dangered Species Act and all
local, state and federal laws in
its operations of Searsville
Dam and Reservoir," Hay
ward wrote.
The future of Searsville
Dam and the steelhead trout
To further investigate pos
sible long-term futures for the
dam, Stanford faculty mem
bers are continuing their re
search on the reservoir. The
University has also estab
lished the Searsville Alterna
tives Study, which has a steer
ing committee that recom
mends actions for the reser
voir that best meet a balance
of University objectives.

American Rivers is an or
ganization dedicated to pro
tecting the nation's rivers and
is currently a member of the
advisory group for the
Searsville Alternatives Study.
