## Epicenter student fellows visit Stanford 
### KYLIE JUE DESK EDITOR 
From Mar. 20 to Mar. 22, 88 stu
dents from colleges across the coun
try visited Stanford and Silicon Val
ley through the National Center of
Engineering Pathways to Innova
tion (Epicenter)'s University Inno
vation Fellows program to learn
about entrepreneurship and innova
tion through hands-on designing,
listening to speakers and even danc

ing.
Goals of the program
Funded by the National Science
Foundation, Epicenter is directed
by Stanford University and the Na
tional Collegiate Inventors and In
novators Alliance (NCIIA). The
Epicenter promotes innovation in
undergraduate education, and its
University Innovation Fellows pro
gram aims to train students to "be
come leaders who catalyze change"
at their schools.

"We believe very strongly that
engineers cannot graduate with just
excellent technical skills," said Leti
cia Britos Cavagnaro Ph.D. 'll,
deputy director of Epicenter. "They
also need to graduate with skills to
identify and create opportunities."
"Specifically, we feel students are
key players to shaping their own ed
ucations," she added. "They are
change agents to shaping not only
their education but [also] the Uni
versity."
Britos Cavagnaro explained that
the program began on a much small
er scale in an effort by the NCIIA
four years ago.
"We worked together and re
vamped it completely. We changed
the philosophy," Britos Cavagnaro
said. "Now we are tasking the stu
dents to be more strategic
thinkers. They are to analyze their
schools' landscapes and what
changes they want to make in their
own school."
Fellows are selected through an
application process and must be
sponsored by a faculty member.
Each year, the Epicenter supports
two cohorts of fellows: one in the
spring and one in the fall. Following
acceptance into the program, stu
dents must complete six weeks of
online training using the massive
open online course platform
NovoEd.
