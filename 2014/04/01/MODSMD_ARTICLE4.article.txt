## Arrillaga to build new reproductive center 
### â€“ Ron Burgundy 
Stanford announced plans on
Monday for the construction of a
multipurpose reproductive cen
ter, with completion scheduled
for 2015.

The center, made possible by
a $69 million donation from phi
lanthropist John Arrillaga '6O,
will be called the Arrillaga Fam
ily Semen Center. The new facil
ity will have 45 individual donat
ing booths, outfitted with the lat
est semen receiving technology.
After noticing numerous ads
in The Daily soliciting sperm
donors and meeting with stu
dents to discuss concerns about
the current sperm donating
process, Arrillaga decided to do
nate the funds necessary to
build the state-of-the-art facility.
Several University adminis

trators, speaking on condition of
anonymity, noted that the open
ing of the facility would be cou
pled with the release of a new
app to help connect sperm
donors and individuals seeking
sperm. The app, tentatively
named Jackr, will use profiles
and questionnaires to match in
dividuals.

Administrators noted, how
ever, that the plan had received
pushback from Yaden officials,
who had expressed concern that
the center would reduce then
stranglehold on reproductive
health.
