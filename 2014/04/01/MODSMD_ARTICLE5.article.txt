# Campus construction to expand and become louder
## 
### â€“ A.R. Martin 
Residents of Stern Hall have
been informed via email that
construction occurring on
Galvez Street will continue
through spring quarter with
"slower, but substantially
louder progress."
The Galvez construction,
which has been underway at
the intersection of Arguello
and Bowdoin Streets since
early 2013, is scheduled for
completion in 2017, when
current Stern freshmen will
graduate. To meet the new,
extended deadline, construc
tion is anticipated to
progress at a rate of four
square centimeters of road
per week.
One resident expressed
his happiness that construc
tion will start and end with
his generation.

"I first heard it when I
stayed at Burbank during
Admit Weekend when it was
on Arguello, and now living
in Serra, it's right by my
side! I love it!" said Charlie
McFadden 'l7.
Construction workers
stressed that, as with every
thing on Stanford's campus,
they are partnering with lo
cal wildlife organizations to
leave as little impact as pos
sible.

"We're partnering with
the birds that wake up at
4:30 a.m. to keep residents
up 24/7," said Patrick Smith,
one construction worker on
what is essentially a job-cre
ation project. "The birds
start chirping at 4:30 and go
on until about 6 a.m. which is
when we take over. We like
to start with the jackham
mer to really just fill the still,
quiet air with deafening,
heart-stopping noise. It's
symbolic."

Other dorms have ex
pressed anger about Stern's
construction to residential
services, saying that they
too wish they had a consis
tent, unavoidable "pseudo
alarm clock" paid for by
Stanford.

"We really would like to
have this construction hap
pen near our dorms too,"
said one Wilbur premed res
ident. "I mean...it is just
putting me behind Stern res
idents if they're up every
day at 6 a.m."

Residential services stat
ed that similar construction
projects will be launched by
Wilbur and Roble Halls by
the start of next year, with
projects for Lagunita Court
to follow soon after.

"We really want to
spread this equally to all of
the dorms," said Louis
Thompson, residential serv

ices spokesperson. "And giv
en that these projects are ar
bitrary and totally made up,
it's really easy. We just break
open the street and repair it,
so it's a viable idea any
where."
