# STUDENT LIFE
## Aziz Ansari sells out in minutes 
### NITISH KULKARNI DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Tickets for an April 4 performance
by comedian Aziz Ansari sold out in min
utes yesterday evening, with students
unable to claim tickets shortly after they
went on sale online at 8.00 p.m.
Cardinal Nights, the alcohol-free
programming initiative that was in
volved in organizing the event, quickly
moved to prevent any illegal re-sales of
the tickets.

In an email to the general student
body, the initiative cautioned that tickets
were being sold on a newly created
black market for hundreds of dollars. In
a policy change to prevent illegal
ticket resale, the name on the tick
et and the student ID of attendees
will have to match for admission to
the show.
The event had previously
elicited controversy when it was
moved from Memorial Auditori
um to the significantly smaller
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, due to
space conflicts with the perform
ance of "Les Miserables" next
week. The ASSU Undergraduate
Senate had given the Stanford
Speakers Bureau, the organiza
tion hosting the event, an extra
$20,000 under the understanding

that the event would "significant
ly benefit the entire Student [sic]
body" rather than a smaller sub-
S6t
Senate Bill UGS-W2013-3,
written by John-Lancaster Finley
'l6, stated that "SSE should im
mediately transfer the amount of
$20,000 from the Undergraduate
Buffer Fund to the Associated
Students of Stanford University
Speakers Bureau; and THAT The
transfer be made to the SPEAK
ERS SPEC FEE HONORARIA
FEES account (SSE Account #2-
5052-2-5-6310)."
By time of press, The Daily was
unable to confirm whether the
transfer of funds remains valid giv
en the location change.
