# STANFORD'S THAI CAFÃ‰
## Serving the Main Quad since 1987 
### NITISH KULKARNI DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Thai Cafe is Stanford's hole
in-the-wall restaurant, tucked in
a niche near the Math Corner
but well known to many for of
fering good yet affordable food.
A longstanding Stanford institu
tion, the establishment has been
serving food to the University
community since 1987, when it
was founded by the petite and
gray-haired Mykanh Bahlman
and her then-husband.
While for decades the cafe
has been known to many stu
dents as Thai Cafe, however, the
majority of its menu isn't even
Thai food, consisting mostly of
Vietnamese soups and salads. In
fact, the cafe wasn't even origi
nally called Thai Cafe.
What's in a name
"I'm Vietnamese," Bahlman
noted, admitting that many have
mistaken her as being Thai.
Originally, the eatery was
called the Jordan Hall Cafe but
changed its official name during
its renovation five years ago.
"Though it's not actually
called the Thai Cafe, people have
been calling it that for over 20
years," she said. "I just went
ahead and changed it. We used
to try and correct people and
have the original name written

all over the menu, but it never
made a difference."
A customer standing in line
who preferred not to be named
echoed Bahlman's account, not
ing that despite having eaten
at the cafe many times over the
course of decades she had on
ly referred to the restaurant as
"Thai Cafe."
"I never knew that it was
called the Jordan Hall Cafe," the
customer expressed.
The "Thai Cafe" name even
crossed over international bor
ders.
"Customers come from all
over the world and ask for the
Thai Cafe," Bahlman said. "I
have one customer from Italy, a
professor who used to come with
his wife to the cafe at least once
every summer."
Recent renovations
Although it may seem like
the busy Thai Cafe is already
comfortably situated in its place
in the basement of Building 380,
the cafe only recently moved to
its current location.
Before assuming its current
location, the cafe used to be on
the fifth floor of the building be
fore later moving into the oppo
site side of its current location.
