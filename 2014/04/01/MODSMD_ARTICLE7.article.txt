# STANFORD'S THAI CAFÉ
## Serving the Main Quad since 1987 
### NITISH KULKARNI DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Thai Cafe is Stanford's hole
in-the-wall restaurant, tucked in
a niche near the Math Corner
but well known to many for of
fering good yet affordable food.
A longstanding Stanford institu
tion, the establishment has been
serving food to the University
community since 1987, when it
was founded by the petite and
gray-haired Mykanh Bahlman
and her then-husband.
While for decades the cafe
has been known to many stu
dents as Thai Cafe, however, the
majority of its menu isn't even
Thai food, consisting mostly of
Vietnamese soups and salads. In
fact, the cafe wasn't even origi
nally called Thai Cafe.
What's in a name
"I'm Vietnamese," Bahlman
noted, admitting that many have
mistaken her as being Thai.
Originally, the eatery was
called the Jordan Hall Cafe but
changed its official name during
its renovation five years ago.
"Though it's not actually
called the Thai Cafe, people have
been calling it that for over 20
years," she said. "I just went
ahead and changed it. We used
to try and correct people and
have the original name written

all over the menu, but it never
made a difference."
A customer standing in line
who preferred not to be named
echoed Bahlman's account, not
ing that despite having eaten
at the cafe many times over the
course of decades she had on
ly referred to the restaurant as
"Thai Cafe."
"I never knew that it was
called the Jordan Hall Cafe," the
customer expressed.
The "Thai Cafe" name even
crossed over international bor
ders.
"Customers come from all
over the world and ask for the
Thai Cafe," Bahlman said. "I
have one customer from Italy, a
professor who used to come with
his wife to the cafe at least once
every summer."
Recent renovations
Although it may seem like
the busy Thai Cafe is already
comfortably situated in its place
in the basement of Building 380,
the cafe only recently moved to
its current location.
Before assuming its current
location, the cafe used to be on
the fifth floor of the building be
fore later moving into the oppo
site side of its current location.
"We moved from [the other

side of the building] in 2009,"
Bahlman said. "It took over
14 months of renovation."
Bahlman lamented the
fact that during those 14
months when the restaurant
was closed, the cafe generat
ed no revenue. She also not
ed that the newer location,
though larger in total, has a
smaller kitchen, which
meant that they could only
have a third of their original
kitchen equipment in the
space.
"The kitchen size is what
really restricts the kind of
food that you can serve," she
said. "It gets really cramped
in there, and it is a little dif
ficult to move around."
Affordable prices on an ex
pensive campus
The limited kitchen size
isn't the only reason for the
relatively small menu, how
ever. According to Bahlman,
the menu is designed for the
cafe to be affordable for stu
dents.
"Most of my customers
are students," she said.
"That's why I haven't raised
the price much and hope not
to raise it past six dollars pet
food item."
She framed that desire to
limit prices as the cause of
her refusal to take credit
cards, as the fees needed to
take cards would end up
raising the prices.
Food prices have indeed
remained relatively consis
tent. The price for an entree
was $5.50 up to 2004, but
even the current $6 per food
item still presents appeal for
customers.
Yasmin Bashirova 'l7 ar
gued that the pricing gave
the food good value in com
parison to other locations on
campus.
"The price is acceptable
for a big portion of food," she
said, adding that at other
places on campus, a similar
item is much more expen
sive.
In addition, Bashirova
commented the convenience
of equal pricing for each en
tree, which Bahlman later
explained was to ensure that
the entire menu was afford
able for students.
"Everything is the same

price, so there is no financial
restriction in buying certain
items," Bashirova said.
Bahlman noted, however,
that low prices make it more
difficult to maintain a steady
margin. She expressed con
cern about having to raise
the prices, explaining that
the rental rate she pays for
the restaurant's lease will
rise —by 56.25 percent
when she renews her con
tract.
Gradual food price in
creases over the years have
meant that certain items
have had to come off the
menu. Thai Cafe used to
serve banh mi, a Vietnamese
sandwich, but it was taken
off the menu because it could
not be sold at the same price
as the other items and need
ed more kitchen space to
prepare.
The fastest line on campus
The Thai Cafe is known
for more than its food,
though. Many students joke
about the line at the cafe be
ing the antithesis of the
lengthy and protracted line
at the post office.
Bahlman explained that
the menu is designed to en
able fast preparation and
serving of food.
"We buy fresh produce
and do preparation for food
every morning," Bahlman
said. "I normally get to the
cafe at around 5 a.m. to pre
pare for the day."
"They do a great job with
serving you right away,"
Bashirova said. "If you're in
a rush to class, you can grab
the salad, unlike lots of oth
er places."
Bashirova recalled that
she was in a hurry the first
time she went to Thai Cafe.
"I think the first time I
went there was my second
week, because I had CME
100 in Building 420, and I
realized that it was a place
[where] I could go to eat and
get to class quickly and on
time."
Bahlman said that the
cafe serves around 350 peo
ple for lunch on weekdays,
with the length of the line
peaking at around noon.
"I make sure that the
line is short. Even at its
peak you never have to
stand in it for over 20 min
utes," she said.
