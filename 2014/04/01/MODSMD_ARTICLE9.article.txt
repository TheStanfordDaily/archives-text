## Northwestern football players threaten NCAA 
### Ashley Westhem 
Northwestern football
players were granted
the light to unionize by
the National Labor
Relations Board (NL
RB) last week. The players were
deemed "employees" of the university
and so the NLRB Region 13 director,
Peter Sung Ohr, approved the ruling.
I wish this ruling had been made to
day so that I could know for certain
that this was an April Fool's joke. Right
now, I'm just hoping they decided to
make the joke a little early
I just spent the majority of this
school year interviewing athletes to
gain insight into what it's like to be a
student-athlete at the collegiate level.
It's not all shiny new Nike apparel and
free books; there's a lot of time, pain
and energy that goes into competing at
the highest level. But almost all ath
letes agreed that their love for the
sport is what makes it all worthwhile.
The perks are nice, but as many ath
letes expressed to the NCAA while this
case was under review by the NLRB,
they "participate [in a sport] to en
hance their overall college experience."
The ability of high-revenue teams
at private universities to unionize could
end up undermining the integrity of
collegiate athletics and blur its distinc
tion from professional sports, while al
so creating a divide between academic
and athletic pursuits on campus.

The whole debacle was not founded
on money, however. Northwestern sen
ior quarterback Kain Colter brought
the question of unionizing the team to
the attention of the National College
Players Association, which filed a peti
tion on behalf of players to increase
protection against injuries. The peti
tion was not about earning money for
the players, but rather arose out of con
cern for athletes' health care coverage.
The players believed that athletes
shouldn't have to pay for injuries in
curred while playing their sport or lose
their scholarship if forced to retire due
to an injury; basically they deserve
some form of workers' protection.
Although the petition arose from a
desire to increase the protection of stu
dent-athletes' welfare, Ohr's decision
to unionize the team was made from a
purely business angle, treating the
case as any other he might deal with
and not taking into account that the
players are not just "employees" but
are also students and have responsibil
ities to the university other than to play
their sport. The ruling could lead to
confusion about the job of a student
athlete: to go to class while simultane
ously representing the university ath
letically or simply to play their sport
and focus on that endeavor? The ruling
basically asserts that the football play
ers are hired by the coaches and paid in
scholarship money and so can be con
sidered employed by the university, as
are students working in the library.
But if players are being hired by
coaches, then what role does the ad
missions process play? One Stanford
student-athlete questioned whether
football players will then be admitted
to the university as paid employees to
play football or as students.
While it is true that the life of a stu
dent-athlete differs greatly from that
of a non-athlete, they are still students
just the same and are receiving an ed
ucation in return for the commitment
they put into their sport. Ohr criticized
coaches for breaking the NCAAs hour
limits with the imposition of extra
meetings, film-watching and "volun
tary" workouts and that players
should be compensated for those.
Student-athletes do receive incen
tives besides scholarships, however, to
reward them for all the time they put
into their sport. Some universities go
so far as to allow special housing for
athletes (Auburn) and hold more le
nient academic standards for athletes
(causing controversy at the University
of Georgia). At Stanford, athletes re
ceive free books, units for their sport
(although a mere eight units for an ath
lete's entire career is a bit ludicrous),
tutoring fi'om the AARC and the red
backpack, for example.
Northwestern is going to appeal
the decision, but Northwestern players
will vote to be unionized and could sub
sequently be entitled to bargain collec
tively with Northwestern regarding
player benefits. Other private universi
ties could make this happen on their
own campuses, and if that becomes the
case, the spirit of collegiate athletics
will be tainted. Student-athletes play to
play—and maybe to pay for college
and shouldn't be given exorbitant
preferential treatment Although this
was not the intent of the Northwestern
football players, the ruling could be

construed in this way in the fu
ture.

I have the utmost respect
for student-athletes. Heck, I
aspire to be an Athletic Direc
tor at a major university so that
I can positively impact and im
prove their college experi
ences. But that improvement is
not going to be found by under
mining the NCAA and unioniz
ing its teams.

friend, Chiney Ogwumike,

athlete, contact her at awest

curred while playing their sport or lose

some form of workers' protection.
Although the petition arose from a
desire to increase the protection of stu
dent-athletes' welfare, Ohr's decision
to unionize the team was made from a
purely business angle, treating the
case as any other he might deal with
and not taking into account that the
players are not just "employees" but
are also students and have responsibil
ities to the university other than to play
their sport. The ruling could lead to
confusion about the job of a student
athlete: to go to class while simultane
ously representing the university ath
letically or simply to play their sport
and focus on that endeavor? The ruling
basically asserts that the football play
ers are hired by the coaches and paid in
scholarship money and so can be con
sidered employed by the university, as
are students working in the library.
But if players are being hired by
coaches, then what role does the ad
missions process play? One Stanford
student-athlete questioned whether
football players will then be admitted
to the university as paid employees to
play football or as students.
While it is true that the life of a stu
dent-athlete differs greatly from that
of a non-athlete, they are still students
just the same and are receiving an ed
ucation in return for the commitment
they put into their sport. Ohr criticized
coaches for breaking the NCAAs hour
limits with the imposition of extra
meetings, film-watching and "volun
tary" workouts and that players
should be compensated for those.
Student-athletes do receive incen
tives besides scholarships, however, to
reward them for all the time they put
into their sport. Some universities go
so far as to allow special housing for
athletes (Auburn) and hold more le
nient academic standards for athletes
(causing controversy at the University
of Georgia). At Stanford, athletes re
ceive free books, units for their sport
(although a mere eight units for an ath
lete's entire career is a bit ludicrous),
tutoring fi'om the AARC and the red
backpack, for example.
Northwestern is going to appeal
the decision, but Northwestern players
will vote to be unionized and could sub
sequently be entitled to bargain collec
tively with Northwestern regarding
player benefits. Other private universi
ties could make this happen on their
own campuses, and if that becomes the
case, the spirit of collegiate athletics
will be tainted. Student-athletes play to
play—and maybe to pay for college
and shouldn't be given exorbitant
preferential treatment Although this
was not the intent of the Northwestern
football players, the ruling could be

construed in this way in the fu
ture.

I have the utmost respect
for student-athletes. Heck, I
aspire to be an Athletic Direc
tor at a major university so that
I can positively impact and im
prove their college experi
ences. But that improvement is
not going to be found by under
mining the NCAA and unioniz
ing its teams.

Northwestern football
players were granted
the light to unionize by
the National Labor
Relations Board (NL
RB) last week. The players were
deemed "employees" of the university
and so the NLRB Region 13 director,
Peter Sung Ohr, approved the ruling.
I wish this ruling had been made to
day so that I could know for certain
that this was an April Fool's joke. Right
now, I'm just hoping they decided to
make the joke a little early
I just spent the majority of this
school year interviewing athletes to
gain insight into what it's like to be a
student-athlete at the collegiate level.
It's not all shiny new Nike apparel and
free books; there's a lot of time, pain
and energy that goes into competing at
the highest level. But almost all ath
letes agreed that their love for the
sport is what makes it all worthwhile.
The perks are nice, but as many ath
letes expressed to the NCAA while this
case was under review by the NLRB,
they "participate [in a sport] to en
hance their overall college experience."
The ability of high-revenue teams
at private universities to unionize could
end up undermining the integrity of
collegiate athletics and blur its distinc
tion from professional sports, while al
so creating a divide between academic
and athletic pursuits on campus.

The whole debacle was not founded
on money, however. Northwestern sen
ior quarterback Kain Colter brought
the question of unionizing the team to
the attention of the National College
Players Association, which filed a peti
tion on behalf of players to increase
protection against injuries. The peti
tion was not about earning money for
the players, but rather arose out of con
cern for athletes' health care coverage.
