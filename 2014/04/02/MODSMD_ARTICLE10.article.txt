in a row and the eighth time
overall this season that the Car

The morning began with
doubles matches, in which all
three Stanford pairs quickly
routed the Wildcats, dropping
only six games across the three
courts. On court one, the No. 10
ranked duo of senior Kristie

Ahn and freshman Carol Zhao

over Arizona's Lacey Smyth and
Shayne Austin. Freshman Caro
