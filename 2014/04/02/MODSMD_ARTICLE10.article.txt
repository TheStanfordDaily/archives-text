The No. 4 Stanford women's
tennis team (13-0, 5-0 Pac-12)
continued steamrolling its com
petition this past weekend,
cruising past No. 35 Arizona (14-
3, 3-2) and No. 23 Arizona State

The back-to-back wins ex
tended the Cardinal's unbeaten
streak to 19 consecutive match
es, dating back to last year's
NCAA Tournament.
Stanford won last Friday's
match against Arizona 7-0 in
front of Pac-12 Networks cam
eras, which was the fourth time
in a row and the eighth time
overall this season that the Car
dinal blanked their opponent.
The morning began with
doubles matches, in which all
three Stanford pairs quickly
routed the Wildcats, dropping
only six games across the three
courts. On court one, the No. 10
ranked duo of senior Kristie

Ahn and freshman Carol Zhao
started it off with an 8-1 victory
over Arizona's Lacey Smyth and
Shayne Austin. Freshman Caro
line Doyle and sophomore
Ki'ista Hardebeck followed with
an 8-2 win to clinch the doubles
point and the No. 36 team of
freshman Taylor Davidson and
junior Ellen Tsay wrapped up
with an 8-3 victory on the second

court.
Ahead 1-0, the Cardinal be
gan their singles matches with
No. 42 Tsay demolishing Austin
6-1,6-0 on court five. With every
Stanford singles player national
ly ranked in the top 45, it didn't
take long after that to come up
with two more points to win the

(16-4,3-2) at home.
