## Men's tennis extends season-long winning streak with win over Boise Strife 
### â€” Jordan Wallach 
Extending its season-high winning
streak to six matches, the No. 52 Stan
ford's men's tennis team (9-2, 2-0 Pac
-12) swept No. 22 Boise State (18-4, 20
Mountain West) 4-0 in a rain-shortened
match at Taube Family Tennis Stadium
on Tuesday.
The Cardinal defeated its highest
ranked opponent of the season in the
Broncos, who entered the match on an
eight-match winning streak of their
own.
After the two teams agreed to play
singles first due to a threatening fore
cast, Stanford was able to jump out
with to a quick one-point lead after
sophomore Anthony Tsodikov defeated
Boise State freshman Brendan Mc-
Clain 6-2, 6-2 on court five. Tsodikov
has gone 5-1 in singles during the
team's season-long winning streak.
Stanford extended its lead when
juniors Robert Stineman and John
Morrissey each won their singles
matches in two sets on courts six and
one, respectively.
Stineman has also gone 5-1 in singles
over the Cardinal's last six matches,
while Morrissey has simply been domi
nant with an undefeated 6-0 record in
that span.
The Cardinal clinched the
victory minutes after the
court one win, as sophomore
Maciek Romanowicz won the

No. 2 match, 6-4, 6-3. The
other two singles matches
were abandoned and the
doubles matches were fore
gone after Stanford secured
its win.
For a team that fell in the
first round of the NCAA
Tournament last season, the
Cardinal will look to garner
more confidence as they en

ter the heart of Pac-12 play.
They will certainly be tested
this weekend as they are
slated to take on No. 2 USC
and No. 3 UCLA in a two
match SoCal road trip.
Friday's match at USC
will take place at 1:30 p.m.
and Saturday's at UCLA has
a 1 n.m. start.
