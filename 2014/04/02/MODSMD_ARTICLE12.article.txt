## SEEING GREEN Seeing the Light 
### Holly Moeller 
MANHATTAN BEACH,
CALIF. Warming up
with my volleyball under an
overcast sky at our recent southern
California tournament, I couldn't
help but long for a sunnier welcome.
Still, experienced beachgoers
slather on sunscreen even on cloudy
days, when the dim sunlight lulls
novices into forgetting just how in
tense solar rays can be, and I want
to take a moment to appreciate the
awesome power of our sun.
After all, sunlight is the ultimate
source of energy on Earth's surface.
Even fossil fuels coal, oil and nat
ural gas, which power almost every
aspect of our modern lives are
merely the partly decomposed, com
pacted remains of ancient plants.
People have always dreamed of har
nessing the power of the sun. But
only recently have we had the abili
ty to do so in major ways.
For the last 3.5 billion years or
so, photosynthetic organisms (in
cluding, in modern times, the
plants that provide food, shade and
decoration for humans around the
world) have made our complex food
chain possible by transforming so
lar energy into organic compounds
useful to other organisms. Yet even
they only manage to capture about
one percent of the sunlight that
strikes their leaves (though scien
tists are tinkering with ways to
boost their efficiency).
But the search for renewable en
ergy has led humanity to seek other
ways of capturing this sunlight. In
particular, modern solar panels can
turn 25 percent or more of the light
striking them directly into electrici
ty. Along with hydroelectricity and
wind, solar power is supposed to
lead us into a new era of sustainabil
ity as we transitioned away from re
liance on what is a finite fossil fuel
supply and its unfortunate side
effect, climate change.
And at last, solar power seems
ready for the big stage.
In several states, solar energy
generation has reached "grid pari
ty," meaning that electricity from so
lar panels installed on your roof is as
cheap as or even cheaper than elec
tricity purchased from your local
utility company. This is a major eco
nomic milestone because it means
solar has finally reached the same
price point as traditional electricity
generation (typically from coal, gas
or nuclear power plants). Solar is no
longer the pet project of wealthy
greenies, and as technology contin
ues to improve, it will increasingly
become the economical choice
not just the environmentally con
scious one.
If further proof of solar's success
is necessary, one has only to gauge
the anxiety levels of the electrical
utility companies. After decades of
security in its then-"natural monop
oly" as the only source of electricity
available to homeowners, the utility
industry is suddenly facing substan
tial revenue losses as its customers
shift toward self-sufficiency.
The companies' response has
been almost painfully predictable:
lobbying government officials to im-

pose a monthly fee on solar users
who remain connected to the grid.
Their reasoning is not without
merit: Solar users typically retain
their grid connection to compensate
for the times when their panel in
stallations can't meet their energy
needs (like our gray Manhattan
Beach day, or at nighttime). But this
all evens out: During the day, when
solar users' electricity generation
exceeds demand, they feed this
spare power back into the grid, off
setting their previous usage. At the
end of the month, some homeown
ers have sold back enough electrici
ty to completely offset their usage,
so they owe the utilities nothing.
It's true that solar users benefit
from the extensive and expen
siveâ€” infrastructure provided by
their utility companies. Still, it's
hard to view the exorbitant charges
recommended by the (electric) utili
ty companies as anything but an ef
fort to force solar into an uneconom
ical corner. It's an attempt that Ari
zona regulators recently saw
through, however they set fees
at about $5 per month rather than
the utility-recommended $5O-100.
But monthly tariffs aren't the
only way utilities can try to block
solar. They can also charge unrea
sonable amounts for grid hookups
and drag their feet with lengthy
delays. At least that's what Elon
Musk, of Tesla fame, and Solar City
claim is happening to California
customers, who present a double
threat to the utilities as they begin
to install the company's lithium-ion
batteries.
For now, it makes sense for
homeowners to retain their safety
tether to the grid. But the future of
battery technology which repre
sents complete self-sufficiency,
made possible by storing excess so
lar panel-captured energy in those
batteries during peak production
that can be used at nighttime
clearly results in customers remov
ing themselves completely from re
liance on the grid. By reducing the
revenues of a natural monopoly, in
creased reliance on batteries will
drive up the price for the remaining
utility customers, causing more and
more to jump ship.
The seeming inevitability of this
transition at least in sunny states
like Arizona and California is en
couraging, regardless of whether
your concerns center more on sus
tainability or environmental impact.
And while there will be some fossil
fuel-based hiccups along the way
(for example, as fracking floods the
market with natural gas), it's nice to
see at least one renewable technolo
gy have its day in the sun.
