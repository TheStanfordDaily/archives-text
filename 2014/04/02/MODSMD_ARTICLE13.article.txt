## The 						Merit of Meritocracy 
### Vihan Lakshman 
Meritocracy is a word that we
view with reverence and
pride in our modern society
celebrating the idea that virtual
ly any qualified individual can rise
to the top of his or her field.
Indianapolis Colts quarterback
Andrew Luck 'l2 received a lot of
attention from the media a few
months ago as a champion of meri
tocracy on the football field, once
telling his teammates at Stanford:
"Football is the great meritocracy
in our society... You will be judged
on merit."

Luck's statement is not a pure
and unreserved defense of meritoc
racy, but a reminder to us that foot
ball provides a pure way to judge
someone based on merits in away
that may be difficult to replicate
elsewhere. In college and the NFL,
players who can consistently catch
touchdowns or record sacks will
earn more playing time. Evidently,
football has clear parameters for
identifying merit and rewarding
the right players. The real question
is: How does the rest of society do?
In recent years, many promi
nent voices have questioned the na
ture of meritocracy in America.
MSNBC's Chris Hayes, for exam
ple, argues in his book "Twilight of
the Elites and the End of Meritoc
racy" that many of the problems
facing America in the past decade
particularly the financial crisis

stem from the erosion of our old
meritocratic and democratic system
in favor of a plutocracy in which the
extremely wealthy manipulate the
system for their own benefit.
On the other side of the criti
cisms levied against meritocracy,
writer Joseph Epstein argues in a
Wall Street Journal essay, "The
Late, Great American WASP" that
the ineffectual state of the United
States government stems from a
crop of "self-involved, over
schooled products of modern meri
tocracy" as opposed to the digni
fied, selfless leadership of Ameri
ca's WASP (White Anglo-Saxon
Protestant) ruling class of previous
centuries. David Brooks put it
more bluntly in his headline in The
New York Times: "Why Our Elites
Stink." Brooks argues that meri
tocracy has lost sight of its original
principles: in his words, "The lan
guage of meritocracy (how to suc
ceed) has eclipsed the language of
morality (how to be virtuous)."
While I disagree with Epstein
and Brooks' glorification of an insu
lar, WASP-dominated America,
they do make a powerful point (one
that ties with Hayes' argument)
that maybe our modern meritocra
cy fails to properly define merit.
Today's top government officials
and business leaders are largely
graduates of elite universities,
many of whom have earned Rhodes

Scholarships and other prestigious
honors. Epstein writes: "Having
been a good student, in other
words, means that one was good at
school." But that statement is more
important for what it delicately
leaves out: Doing well in school is
not necessarily the same as getting
a good education and having the
merits of a good citizen and an ef
fective leader.
That's where I think Hayes' and
Epstein's views come together. We
have replaced true merit with ex
clusivity.
This fundamental misunder
standing between merit and exclu
sivity is an extremely important
question to consider at Stanford. I
believe that an education from a
world-class institution with an un
fathomable amount of resources is
extremely valuable, but we need to
be careful about what exactly it
means to have a Stanford educa
tion.
Venture capitalist Peter Thiel
B.A. 'B9 J.D. '92 frequently argues
that the only benefit of schools like
Stanford is in their "artificial exclu
sivity." Students from elite univer
sities are destined to rise to top po
sitions because they have already
earned an exclusive position; there
is very little need to focus on the ac
tual learning experience (beyond
doing what it takes to earn good
grades) while in college.
As Winston Shi addressed in his
column earlier this week, Stanford
admitted a new record low percent
age of applicants at 5.07 percent,

furthering this idea of exclusivity
and perhaps an unapproachable
one. My message to the class of
2018 and to all college students
—is to not be complacent but
rather to seek out a transformative
education that transcends what
goes on a transcript. You have the
freedom, as surprising as it may
seem, to challenge your professor's
ideas if you disagree, question your
values and seriously consider what
it means to have good character.
Success in life is not reduced to a
salary or to the square footage of a
home. But in today's society, the
difference may not be so apparent.
While football may nudge us to
think that life reduces to a series of
easily interpretable statistics, the
truth is never that simple (and it is
n't that simple for football either).
All our lives, we have been present
ed with a series of achievable objec
tives on the path to Stanford, with
our statistics and our measurables
and our numeric goals and dreams.
But it takes effort to see the forest
through the trees.
By being fortunate enough to
attend Stanford, we are certainly in
a special position, but exclusivity
does not equal merit. We still need
to work to develop knowledge and
character the real merits of a
meritocracy —to have what it
takes to make a positive impact on
the world and find the real value of
a Stanford education.

home. But in today's society, the
difference may not be so apparent.
While football may nudge us to
think that life reduces to a series of
easily interpretable statistics, the
truth is never that simple (and it is
n't that simple for football either).
All our lives, we have been present
ed with a series of achievable objec
tives on the path to Stanford, with
our statistics and our measurables
and our numeric goals and dreams.
But it takes effort to see the forest
through the trees.
By being fortunate enough to
attend Stanford, we are certainly in
a special position, but exclusivity
does not equal merit. We still need
to work to develop knowledge and
character the real merits of a
meritocracy —to have what it
takes to make a positive impact on
the world and find the real value of
a Stanford education.

Meritocracy is a word that we
view with reverence and
pride in our modern society
celebrating the idea that virtual
ly any qualified individual can rise
to the top of his or her field.
Indianapolis Colts quarterback
Andrew Luck 'l2 received a lot of
attention from the media a few
months ago as a champion of meri
tocracy on the football field, once
telling his teammates at Stanford:
"Football is the great meritocracy
in our society... You will be judged
on merit."

Luck's statement is not a pure
and unreserved defense of meritoc
racy, but a reminder to us that foot
ball provides a pure way to judge
someone based on merits in away
that may be difficult to replicate
elsewhere. In college and the NFL,
players who can consistently catch
touchdowns or record sacks will
earn more playing time. Evidently,
football has clear parameters for
identifying merit and rewarding
the right players. The real question
is: How does the rest of society do?
In recent years, many promi
nent voices have questioned the na
ture of meritocracy in America.
MSNBC's Chris Hayes, for exam
ple, argues in his book "Twilight of
the Elites and the End of Meritoc
racy" that many of the problems
facing America in the past decade
particularly the financial crisis

stem from the erosion of our old
meritocratic and democratic system
in favor of a plutocracy in which the
extremely wealthy manipulate the
system for their own benefit.
On the other side of the criti
cisms levied against meritocracy,
writer Joseph Epstein argues in a
Wall Street Journal essay, "The
Late, Great American WASP" that
the ineffectual state of the United
States government stems from a
crop of "self-involved, over
schooled products of modern meri
tocracy" as opposed to the digni
fied, selfless leadership of Ameri
ca's WASP (White Anglo-Saxon
Protestant) ruling class of previous
centuries. David Brooks put it
more bluntly in his headline in The
New York Times: "Why Our Elites
Stink." Brooks argues that meri
tocracy has lost sight of its original
principles: in his words, "The lan
guage of meritocracy (how to suc
ceed) has eclipsed the language of
morality (how to be virtuous)."
While I disagree with Epstein
and Brooks' glorification of an insu
lar, WASP-dominated America,
they do make a powerful point (one
that ties with Hayes' argument)
that maybe our modern meritocra
cy fails to properly define merit.
Today's top government officials
and business leaders are largely
graduates of elite universities,
many of whom have earned Rhodes

Scholarships and other prestigious
honors. Epstein writes: "Having
been a good student, in other
words, means that one was good at
school." But that statement is more
important for what it delicately
leaves out: Doing well in school is
not necessarily the same as getting
a good education and having the
merits of a good citizen and an ef
fective leader.
That's where I think Hayes' and
Epstein's views come together. We
have replaced true merit with ex
clusivity.
This fundamental misunder
standing between merit and exclu
sivity is an extremely important
question to consider at Stanford. I
believe that an education from a
world-class institution with an un
fathomable amount of resources is
extremely valuable, but we need to
be careful about what exactly it
means to have a Stanford educa
tion.
Venture capitalist Peter Thiel
B.A. 'B9 J.D. '92 frequently argues
that the only benefit of schools like
Stanford is in their "artificial exclu
sivity." Students from elite univer
sities are destined to rise to top po
sitions because they have already
earned an exclusive position; there
is very little need to focus on the ac
tual learning experience (beyond
doing what it takes to earn good
grades) while in college.
As Winston Shi addressed in his
column earlier this week, Stanford
admitted a new record low percent
age of applicants at 5.07 percent,

furthering this idea of exclusivity
and perhaps an unapproachable
one. My message to the class of
2018 and to all college students
—is to not be complacent but
rather to seek out a transformative
education that transcends what
goes on a transcript. You have the
freedom, as surprising as it may
seem, to challenge your professor's
ideas if you disagree, question your
values and seriously consider what
it means to have good character.
