# Embracing Compassion against Mortality
## 
### Ajit Vakharia 
"So, are you happy at
Carnegie?"
"Ajit, that's an irrelevant
question."
"How so?"
"My happiness depends on
the happiness of those around
m.e. What you should he asking
is, 'Rohan, are you making
everyone around you happy?
And are you doing so with com
passion in your heart?"'

My brother committed suicide
four years ago while attend
ing Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity. He is my best friend; I love
him more than anything else. And I
know he loves me back.
That love has not made my last
four years unproblematic. Since Au
gust 27, 2009, my life has been a
dance with the devil. Losing a sib
ling to suicide is cruel; I can un
equivocally say it should never hap
pen. Ever. Every step forward is a
hurdle, and for every hurdle over
come, a far higher one seems to coa
lesce out of thin air. Acknowledging
that his death had had the power to
change me and had indeed changed
me, for instance, opened a troubling
door, one that made me consider
whether I had changed for the
worse because of it. To this day, this
fear troubles my soul.
I have not learned much from my
experience thus far; in fact, I would
say my working model for life is far
more fragile now than it was on Au
gust 26, 2009. To say I am troubled
by death is an understatement; I am
petrified of it. When I wake up to the
monotonous hymn of my phone
alarm, I look out the window, and
wonder Is this the day for me?
As I bike to class, I pray it isn't. For
if something happened to me, would
those close to me be okay? I think of

what Rohan told me: 'Are you mak
ing everyone around you happy?"
My parents have brilliantly come to
terms with my brother's passing;
could they do the same if I too was
taken? Would my friends and family
be able to cope with another sight
ing of the Grim Reaper?
I don't like these questions; they
frighten me. Nevertheless, to dwell
over them is not my choice to make;
they plague me. My belief that I
don't wish to die is certainly impor
tant; and yet it is the fact that I have
little to no control over mortality
(mine and others') that has become
my paramount concern.
With that said, experience has

taught me one key principle during
my struggle. Interestingly, this
truth is not just old and well known;
it might even seem antiquated. Con
sidering my new perspective on the
effects that death has on the world it
leaves behind, I have learned that
happiness should depend on the
happiness of those around you, as
Buddha and all other great philoso
phers have simultaneously preached
for eons.

It is easy to misinterpret this
statement, as I did initially. But ac
knowledging the importance of oth
ers isn't just a casual nod to pain, a
flippant #firstworldproblems. Com
passion is the key that unlocks beau
ty in the human experience.
Individualism is important. It is
one of the major drivers of innova
tion. But my dance with the devil
has taught me that happiness can
not be found within one's own bub
ble. And in this regard, our system
for dealing with each other has to
change.
Socialization can't be dependent
on competition. Why forge relation
ships on tension when they can de
pend on love instead? It seems like a
no-brainer. Yet, it isn't. Most of us
hold onto a preconceived notion of
what being social is, a dogma that
propagates the "grass is always
greener" mentality. We are taught
to believe that life must have win
ners and losers, that we are "in it to
win it," and that there is nothing
worth living for but ourselves.
But what happens when the
grass turns brown? In my case, Au
gust 27 was when the grass turned
not brown but black. We think of
emotional dependence as vulnerabil
ity, but we all should treat ourselves
as vulnerable because we are vul
nerable. Weakness allows others to
see us for who we are, while blithely
proclaiming #strength only festers
the sore that grows in our hearts.
Our confidence in our own individu
ality is not just unproductive. It is
counterproductive.
This means that the essential
questions should be: Are you doing
your best at making those around
you happy? Are you present for
your friends in need? And are you
being compassionate even to those
who you may not know? We may not
all accomplish these goals at all
times, and I certainly don't;
nonetheless, orienting ourselves to
wards them is the avenue to filling
hearts with joy.
I love my brother. I am not
ashamed to tell his story, for his wis
dom will affect me for the rest of my
life. Though his death once turned
my core cold, my soul is beginning to
thaw. I now recognize that showing
compassion for all is vital. Dancing
with the devil is natural. But letting
the dance spark your own emotional
hubris is not.
My happiness depends on the
happiness of others. What I should
be asking you is: "Are you making
everyone around you happy? And
are you doing so with compassion in
your heart?"
