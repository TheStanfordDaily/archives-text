# Men fall short at NCAAs
## 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford men's swim
ming and diving finished its
season with an underwhelm
ing ninth-place finish last
weekend at the NCAA
Championships, at which Cal
claimed its third national ti
tle in four years. Juniors
David Nolan and Kristian
Ipsen failed to defend their
four combined national titles
from last season as no Cardi
nal swimmers won events at
the 2014 meet.
After finishing in the top
four as a team at the NCAAs
in 31 straight seasons from
1982 to 2012, the Cardinal has
now finished in seventh and
ninth in 2013 and 2014, mark
ing an unexpected downward
trend for the program de
spite the strong talent that it
fielded in both seasons.
"We competed well
enough to stay in the top 10,
but our performance came
up short of representing our

talent," said head coach Ted
Knapp to GoStanford.com.
"We know we will be more
competitive next year."
Nolan though he ulti
mately finished in third in
the event set a new Stan
ford record in the 200-yard
backstroke with his 1:39.17,
breaking his mark of 1:39.31
that earned him a runner-up
finish at last year's champi
onships. However, the im
provement was not enough
to overcome a monster swim
from Cal freshman Ryan
Murphy, who burst onto the
scene in his first NCAA
Championships by setting a
new NCAA record in the
event with an eye-popping
1:37.35.
Nolan and Ipsen, the de
fending national champions
in the 200-yard individual
medley (IM) and 1-meter
diving event, respectively,
were expected to be strong
threats given their excellent
seasons and previous confer
ence titles in those events.

However, Nolan's time of
1:41.38, nearly two-tenths of
a second slower than his
championship time of
1:41.21, was not enough to
push past the competition, as
Florida senior Marcin Cies
lak narrowly missed the
NCAA record with a winning
time of 1:40.58.
Meanwhile, Ipsen was
unable to replicate his
record-breaking perform
ance in the 1-meter dive
from a season ago, as his fi
nals mark of 436.55 was not
good enough to edge out
Texas freshman Michael
Hixon, who took the national
title with a 443.50 score. In
addition, the two-time de
fending national champion in
the 3-meter dive was unable
to extend his dominance to
three straight seasons, as he
slipped to a fourth-place fin
ish with a mark of 394.90 in
the finals more than 50
points fewer than his effort
in the event last season.
Sophomore Tom Kremer

won the "B" final of the 200-
yard freestyle with a strong
1:33.32 swim after having
claimed a bronze in last
year's edition of the event as
a freshman in 1:33.07. De
spite a time in the prelimi
naries that would have quali
fied him for the "A" final in
last year's field, improved
depth from around the na
tion four swimmers fin
ished in under 1:33.00 this
season, as opposed to two
last season pushed him
back to the "B" final this sea
son.
Despite a disappointing
finish at this year's NCAAs,
however, both Nolan and
Ipsen will be back next sea
son for one final opportunity
to lead the team back into
the upper echelons of the na
tional swimming world and
will have a talented, quickly
developing supporting cast
to help them do so.
