# ON TO THE Music CITY
## Cardinal rally past Tar Heels to reach Final Four 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
Country music was blasting, a country
twang was heard in the voices of the players
buzzing with excitement, fried chicken was
being munched on and "NASHVILLE" was
printed across the white board. The locker
room was filled with energy, as the south
ward-bound Stanford's women's basketball
team celebrated its regional final victory over
North Carolina. For the 11th time under head
coach Tara VanDerveer, the Cardinal are
headed to the Final Four of the NCAA Tour
nament.
The Cardinal's 74-65 victory over the Tar
Heels wasn't a guarantee from the opening
tip, but as Ail-American senior forward
Chiney Ogwumike said post-game, it was
"heart, heart, heart" and not "perfectly exe
cuted plays" that earned Stanford the win.
Stanford trailed UNC at the half by six points
after the Tar Heels' electric 7-for-13 (53.8%)
3-point shooting to open the game.
"If a game was like five minutes long, we
would not be sitting up here and be in a good
mood. If the game was even ten minutes long,
we'd probably not be excited," VanDerveer
said. "But in 40 minutes, our team really
showed great resilience, figured out things
that were working, worked really hard to
gether and beat an excellent UNC team."
After junior point guard Amber Orrange
scored the first basket of the game on Stan
ford's opening possession, the Cardinal went
cold for the next five minutes of play, allowing
the Tar Heels to take an early 7-2 lead. UNC
knocked down five consecutive 3-pointers to
push the lead to 22-9 with 12:47 remaining in
the first half.
The Tar Heels dominated the Cardinal in
the paint in the opening half of play, limiting
Ogwumike to just four points. The first half
boiled down to a shooting competition as
both teams scored under 10 points in the

Second-seeded Stanford overcame a halftime deficit to defeat fourth-seeded UNC and book their tickets to the Final Four. Senior forward
Chiney Ogwumike (right) did not disappoint in her final game at Maples, finishing with a game-high 20 points and 10 rebounds.

paint. Orrange held up the
Cardinal offense in the first
half with 12 points, finishing
the game with 14 points and
four assists.
"I think our team did a re
ally good job of not being dis
couraged," Ogwumike said.
"Basketball is a game of
runs. They had a run in the
beginning of the game, and
we got our run right before
halftime to give us a chance
in the second half."
While freshman guard
Lili Thompson was able to
shut down the Tar Heel's
freshman sensation Diamond
DeShields, holding her to
just four points in the first
half, it was freshman Allisha
Gray who lit it up with 15
points in the first half, lead
ing the Tar Heels' charge
against the Card.
The second half was all
Cardinal for nearly all 20
minutes. Stanford outscored
UNC 44-29 in the second
half, shooting 58.6 percent
and holding UNC to just 37.9
percent. Orrange played sti
fling defense on Gray and on
ly allowed her four points,
while Thompson continued to
contain DeShields, allowing
her just nine points in the
second half for a total of 13 in
the game. DeShields had
been averaging 18.8 points
per game this season.
Stanford made key ad
justments at halftime to get
the ball to Ogwumike more
effectively. Ogwumike fin
ished the game with 20 points
and 10 rebounds. Her 93
points in this year's NCAA
Tournament ranks second
behind Baylor's Odyssey

Sims, and her 167 career re
bounds in the tournament
rank tenth in NCAA history.
Redshirt senior Mikaela
Ruef provided a resurgent
spark in the second half, ral
lying the crowd behind the
players, when she knocked
down three 3-pointers. She
finished the game with a ca
reer-high 17 points and three
assists that perfectly set Og
wumike up underneath the
basket to score. Her "best
game ever putting on a Stan
ford uniform," according to
VanDerveer, earned her re
gional MVP honors. Ruef had
only knocked down six 3-
pointers in her career prior
to last night's game.
"[The defense] was liter
ally standing in the paint, and
I was like, well, you know
what, I'm either going to turn
it over or this is going to go
in, so I shot it, and it went in.
Then I just kept shooting it,"
Ruef said.
After going on a 13-4 run
to open up the half, Stanford
took its first lead since going
up 2-0 to start the game. The
lead changed three times late
in the second half, as UNC
did not allow Stanford to pull
away by more than eight
points. UNC was able to gain
a 63-62 lead with four min
utes remaining on a three
pointer from freshman Jessi
ca Washington.
Thompson, who finished
the game with 10 points and
two steals, scored two of the
Card's next three baskets to
put Stanford in the lead for
good. Junior guard Bonnie
Samuelson iced the game
minutes later with two free
throws to make it a two-pos
session game with 21 seconds
remaining. Samuelson scored
13 points in the win and her
14 three-pointers were the
most by any player in the
2014 NCAA Tournament.
With Ogwumike, Orrange,
Ruef, Thompson and Samuel
son all scoring in double dig
its, the Cardinal offense
looked unstoppable espe
cially in the second halfâ€”
while the defense opened up
great opportunities to score.
This was the first game in
more than a year that five

players scored in double dig
its.

"If we have so many peo
ple [scoring], that's when we
play at our best," Ogwumike
said. "When Amber was do
ing it in the beginning and
Mikaela consistently through
the second half, and Lili com
ing up with big plays off the
dribble, those are the things
that make us a better team."
While it was the last game

at Maples for seniors Ogwu
mike, Ruef and Sara James,
the Cardinal's journey to the
Final Four will continue on
Thursday when the team
travels to Nashville, Tenn.
Stanford will take on the No.
1, undefeated, reigning
NCAA champs Connecticut
on Sunday at 6 p.m.
