# ON TO THE Music CITY
## Cardinal rally past Tar Heels to reach Final Four 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
Country music was blasting, a country
twang was heard in the voices of the players
buzzing with excitement, fried chicken was
being munched on and "NASHVILLE" was
printed across the white board. The locker
room was filled with energy, as the south
ward-bound Stanford's women's basketball
team celebrated its regional final victory over
North Carolina. For the 11th time under head
coach Tara VanDerveer, the Cardinal are
headed to the Final Four of the NCAA Tour
nament.
The Cardinal's 74-65 victory over the Tar
Heels wasn't a guarantee from the opening
tip, but as Ail-American senior forward
Chiney Ogwumike said post-game, it was
"heart, heart, heart" and not "perfectly exe
cuted plays" that earned Stanford the win.
Stanford trailed UNC at the half by six points
after the Tar Heels' electric 7-for-13 (53.8%)
3-point shooting to open the game.
"If a game was like five minutes long, we
would not be sitting up here and be in a good
mood. If the game was even ten minutes long,
we'd probably not be excited," VanDerveer
said. "But in 40 minutes, our team really
showed great resilience, figured out things
that were working, worked really hard to
gether and beat an excellent UNC team."
After junior point guard Amber Orrange
scored the first basket of the game on Stan
ford's opening possession, the Cardinal went
cold for the next five minutes of play, allowing
the Tar Heels to take an early 7-2 lead. UNC
knocked down five consecutive 3-pointers to
push the lead to 22-9 with 12:47 remaining in
the first half.
The Tar Heels dominated the Cardinal in
the paint in the opening half of play, limiting
Ogwumike to just four points. The first half
boiled down to a shooting competition as
both teams scored under 10 points in the
