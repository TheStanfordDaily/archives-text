## Orange Is the New Black writer talks prison reform Kerman draws attention to tack of public scrutiny 
### VICTOR XU STAFF WRITER 
On Tuesday night, Piper
Kerman spoke to students in
CEMEX Auditorium about
prison reform and her 13-
month term in a minimum-se
curity women's prison.
Kerman, the author of the
2010 memoir "Orange Is the
New Black: My Year in a
Women's Prison" that subse
quently inspired the popular
Netflix television show "Or
ange Is the New Black,"
opened the event with a per
sonal account of her incarcera
tion, followed by a discussion
moderated by author and for
mer prisoner Joe Loya, who
corresponded with Kerman
during her imprisonment. The
night ended with a Q&A ses
sion with students and a book
signing.
Shortly after graduating
from Smith College in 1992,
Kerman briefly became in
volved in an international nar

cotics operation. She was in
dicted for her crimes in 1998
but did not begin her incarcer
ation in Danbury, Conn., until
2004 because of legal delays.
She fulfilled 13 months of her
sentence before being released
early for good behavior.
Kerman said a daily routine
and her construction job
helped her retain a sense of
purpose while in prison. She
added that she made lifelong
friends, which she did not ex
pect to happen.
"There was unexpected
kindness from day one," she
recalled.
Kerman said she decided to
write her memoir after her re
lease due to overwhelming in
terest from friends and family
about her experiences. She
hoped the book would shed
light on a system that is often
"hidden from the public view."
"The goal was for people to
pick up a book about prison
[who] might not otherwise read
a book about prison," she said.
In addition to the personal
account of her experiences in

prison, Kerman talked at length
about major issues in the U.S.
prison system, noting skyrocket
ing incarceration rates in Ameri
ca, faulty legislation and jail sen
tences that reflect bias depending
on socioeconomic status and race.
Equally troubling, she added, is
the refusal of the prison-industri
al complex's financial leaders to
reform the system.
Valerie Ong, program associate
for Stern Hall, helped organize the
lecture, along with a lunch and din
ner with Kerman that students
from Stern and the sponsoring or
ganizations attended. Ong said a
major goal of the event was to
raise awareness of causes like
criminal justice and prison reform.
"Prison reform as an issue in
general is a huge one that Stan
ford already does a lot of stuff
with," she said. "But this event is
about raising more awareness.
Some people have never really
been exposed to these issues."
Ong emphasized that the focus
of the event was educational and
thus drew more from the book
and Piper's experiences than from
the Netflix show. For this reason,
Ong and three Stern residential
assistants organized intra-dorm
book clubs several weeks before
hand. Members of the book clubs
read Kerman's memoir and en
gaged in discussions about prison
life and U.S. criminal justice.
Residential assistant Halle
Edwards 'l4 led one such book
club in Donner and helped organ
ize a dinner with Kerman that
several Burbank, Serra and Don
ner students attended.
"I hope the attendees have had
the opportunity to think critically
about the prison system in the
United States and have been in
spired to get involved in either
volunteering or advocacy related
to the prison system," she said.
The lecture was hosted by Res
idential Education and co-spon
sored by the Clayman Institute,
the McCoy Family Center, the
Stanford Criminal Justice Center
and the Feminist, Gender and Sex
uality Studies Program.
