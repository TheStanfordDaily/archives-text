### VICTOR XU STAFF WRITER 
On Tuesday night, Piper
Kerman spoke to students in
CEMEX Auditorium about
prison reform and her 13-
month term in a minimum-se
curity women's prison.
Kerman, the author of the
2010 memoir "Orange Is the
New Black: My Year in a
Women's Prison" that subse
quently inspired the popular
Netflix television show "Or
ange Is the New Black,"
opened the event with a per
sonal account of her incarcera
tion, followed by a discussion
moderated by author and for
mer prisoner Joe Loya, who
corresponded with Kerman
during her imprisonment. The
night ended with a Q&A ses
sion with students and a book
signing.
Shortly after graduating
from Smith College in 1992,
Kerman briefly became in
volved in an international nar

cotics operation. She was in
dicted for her crimes in 1998
but did not begin her incarcer
ation in Danbury, Conn., until
2004 because of legal delays.
She fulfilled 13 months of her
sentence before being released
early for good behavior.
Kerman said a daily routine
and her construction job
helped her retain a sense of
purpose while in prison. She
added that she made lifelong
friends, which she did not ex
pect to happen.
"There was unexpected
kindness from day one," she
recalled.
Kerman said she decided to
write her memoir after her re
lease due to overwhelming in
terest from friends and family
about her experiences. She
hoped the book would shed
light on a system that is often
"hidden from the public view."
"The goal was for people to
pick up a book about prison
[who] might not otherwise read
a book about prison," she said.
In addition to the personal
account of her experiences in
