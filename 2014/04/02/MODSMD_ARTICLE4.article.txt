## Stanford team seeks to advance breast cancer research 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
Last month, a Stanford team won fourth
place in the Breast Cancer Startup Challenge,
in an event that challenged 200 interested
teams to develop new technologies with the
potential to advance breast cancer research.
The event was put on by the Avon Founda
tion for Women in conjunction with the Na
tional Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the Na
tional Institutes of Health, and the Center for
Advancing Innovation.

Graeme Fielder MBA 'l5 explained that
the team had worked with a researcher at
NCI who was developing a new antibody that
would act as a treatment against breast can
cer. The team proposed a plan to combine that
research with technology in order to bring the
researcher's work closer to the clinical aspect.
"Our next step is to refine our plan, go
through the negotiation to get the technology
to NCI and raise funding a lot of funding,
which we're going to do in the next three to
four months," Fielder said.
"It's a really good experience to work with

people from different backgrounds because
everyone is doing what they're doing best but
is also willing to learn," said first-year post
doctoral fellow in neurology Ka Yam Chak, re
flecting on the team members' diverse origins.
"I'm actually surprised by our ability to coor
dinate over three different countries."
Rosemarie Truman, founder and CEO of
the Center for Advancing Innovation, also
lauded the merits of an interdisciplinary team.
"We proposed the design of the teams to be
multi-disciplinary," she said. "A
study was done to see why startups
fail, and the number-one reason was
because the team was one-sided. If
you have a bad invention, you can
always work on another product."
Winners and finalists in the
Breast Cancer Startup Challenge
will not only be recognized for cre
ating a business plan and pitch, as
other competitions require, but
they will also be invited to launch a
startup, negotiate licensing agree
ments and raise seed funding in or
der to further develop their inven
tions.
"We are looking forward to start
ups launching around these inven
tions to accelerate breast cancer re
search and break the mold of how
research is funded," said Marc Hurl
bert, executive director of the Avon
Foundation for Women. "This new
approach, through our partnership
with NCI and CAI, will help trans
late promising inventions from the
academic laboratory to development
and commercialization and ultimate
ly benefit breast cancer patients."

However, despite their success
es, the team anticipates some chal
lenges going into the next stage.
"The biggest one is because
we're young and the amount of
knowledge you need to get to this
particular stage is quite a lot," Field
er said. "We know a bit about what
we need to do. We're naive in some
situations and need to talk to more
people that are experts and be wel
coming of knowledge that is given to
us. We need to be resourceful and
get the help that we need."
Fielder also added that the drug
industry was a relatively challeng
ing sphere but estimated that after
two years, the team should be ready
to start clinical trials.
According to Chak, the team
was extremely privileged to be us
ing the resources of the Stanford
community.
"What's great about Stanford is
that there's a lot of physicians here
that act as resources. We're in an
environment where we have a lot of
resources and the environment just
pushes our people to innovate,
which I don't experience in other in
stitutes and is unique to Stanford,"
Chak said.
