researcher's work closer to the clinical aspect.
"Our next step is to refine our plan, go
through the negotiation to get the technology
to NCI and raise funding a lot of funding,
which we're going to do in the next three to
four months," Fielder said.
"It's a really good experience to work with

people from different backgrounds because
everyone is doing what they're doing best but

doctoral fellow in neurology Ka Yam Chak, re
flecting on the team members' diverse origins.
"I'm actually surprised by our ability to coor
dinate over three different countries."
Rosemarie Truman, founder and CEO of
the Center for Advancing Innovation, also
lauded the merits of an interdisciplinary team.
"We proposed the design of the teams to be
