## Vaden offers birth control counseling 
### KYLIE JUE DESK EDITOR 
Earlier this year, the Vaden Health Center
launched a new Birth Control Peer Educators
(BCE) program that gives students the
chance to act as peer counselors on the topic of
birth control.
Program Origins
According to Julie Richards, a nurse prac
titioner in Medical Services and one of the
Vaden faculty supervisors for the program,
BCEs have existed for several years in a "pi
lot form." The counselors' names were listed
on the Vaden website.
In order to raise awareness about the
BCEs as a resource, Medical Services teamed
up with Health Promotion Services (I Thrive)
this year to hire two student coordinators
Geffan Pearlson 'l4 and Amy Young 'l4 to
manage the program.
Richards explained that many students
use Vaden for family planning services and
that clinicians receive a large amount of ques
tions about contraception. By educating pa
tients beforehand, BCEs allow patients to
come to their appointments well prepared.
"We really hope that we can provide anoth
er way for students to get accurate informa
tion about these kind of medical concerns,"
Richards said. "Then when they come to see
their clinician at Vaden, they can have a more
informed discussion and answer any addition
al questions that they have."
BCEs undergo training to learn both
counseling skills and medical information.
Richards herself helps teach counselors the
medical content they need to advise patients
on birth control.
"We wanted to provide some specific
training along those lines that would focus pri
marily on allowing the counselors to discuss
all the methods that are available," Richards
said.
Donnovan Yisrael 'B9 M.A. '9O, manager of
emotional and sexual health programs at I
Thrive, noted that the BCE program
offers students a chance to be in
volved in sexual health education and
also provides leadership opportuni
ties.
"On the end of the counselors,
they're getting their feet wet and en
joying that process of being a leader,"
Yisrael said.
Yisrael also explained that the
BCEs provide an alternative to of
ten-unreliable online resources.
"I think it's talking to another
peer about... what's involved in the
decision-making process and having
some tender loving care some
compassion and care face-to-face that
you're not going to get from the web,"
Yisrael said.
According to Pearlson and Young,
talking to peers gives students the
opportunity for one-on-one consulta
tions for which clinicians may not
have time.
"Providers don't have enough
time to really sit down with people
and go over all of their options,"
Pearlson said.
They also emphasized that the ed
ucators are not there to provide
emergency contraception or discuss
individuals' specific medical concerns.
"Our program fulfills a veiy spe
cific niche," Young said. "We're not
physicians, we are peer educators.
We're not advising people on what
birth control is right for them; we're
just telling them, 'Here are some of
your options and let's have a discus
sion.'"
The program managers
Pearlson and Young are both sen
iors studying human biology and con
sidering futures in medicine in pri
mary or preventative care. Young is
also a Peer Health Educator (PHE)
at a freshman dorm on campus.
"[l'm] very interested in behav
ioral changes and community en
gagement and more grassroots
change to positively impact health,"
Young said. "I love the idea of the em
powerment aspect of the program
that women could become more in
formed and could come into their doc
tor's office or doctor's appointment
already knowing what questions to
ask."
Pearlson has been conducting the
sis research around the topic of sexu
al health and women's health, and by

interviewing young Latino women
about family planning, she saw first
hand many of the misconceptions
surrounding birth control.
"I've had a lot of friends coming
to me asking me questions [about
birth control and sexual health],"
Pearlson said. "Now I'm formally
trained to do this, and I can actually
better answer their questions."
By working together, the two
hope to expand the program and
bring awareness about the resources
available to students on campus.
"Having the two of us spearhead
ing it is better for [Vaden] because
then we can take control of out
reach," Pearlson explained. "We've
really taken it on as our project."
Dispelling misconceptions
One of the program's main focus
es is dispelling misconceptions about
birth control. Pearlson explained
that many women do not fully under
stand the side effects of different
methods and often assume the worst
about hormonal options.
"[People think] that hormones
are these nebulous things that are
bad for you and going to make you
into a different person," Pearlson
said. "These misconceptions exist
and not only in the population that I
was interviewing but also here at
Stanford."
They explained that many people
do not realize that non-hormonal op
tions for birth control exist, with
some of the biggest misconceptions

revolving around intrauterine de
vices (lUDs).
Inserted through the cervix, an
lUD sits at the bottom of the uterus
and can be either hormonal or non
hormonal. Also known as a "long
acting reversible contraceptive,"
lUDS can last up to 12 years.

"It's more effective than steriliza
tion. It's the most effective form of
birth control," Pearlson said. "No
body actually knows what it looks
like and how really tiny it is and how
it's not going to interfere with any
thing."
She also emphasized that an lUD
does not require daily action like tak
ing a pill and that the process is easy
to reverse at any point in time. Due to
their localized setting, hormonal
lUDs have also been shown to have
fewer side effects than estrogen-con
taining hormonal contraception
methods.

"It's basically giving women flexi
bility that they never had previously,"
Young said.
"I think it's like especially rele
vant [at Stanford]," Pearlson added.
"There are a lot of women who have
future goals of having careers and not
necessarily starting to have kids until
maybe they're thirty or late twen
ties."

Expanding outreach
Last quarter, the program sched
uled over a dozen appointments with
BCEs, and they also sold condom
roses on Valentine's Day to raise

awareness. According to Young, their
patients have been mostly graduate
students but have also included a
number of international students.
They held their first information ses
sion at the end of February and had a
turnout of six people.
"I think we weren't really antici
pating it to be very big so even hav
ing a couple people was really excit
ing for us," Pearlson said. "There
was a guy there which was really
awesome. I think birth control is
generally seen as a woman's issue,
and unfortunately, currently it most
ly is."
Senior Laura Pospisil 'l4 ex
plained that the information session
made her more aware of the re
sources Stanford provides its stu
dents.
"I definitely think that more peo
ple should at least see what's out
there [for birth control]," Pospisil
said. "I think there's this assumption
that people already know everything
there is to know about sexual health,
but... [the information session] filled
in some [gaps] for me."
Several other students who could
not make the event contacted Pearl
son and Young to learn more about
scheduling an appointment.
"We actually got a lot of emails or
text messages from people all over
campus who had heard about it,"
Young said. "It was just an exciting
time because we just sent out this fly
er and then suddenly it hit a lot of dif
ferent lists that we didn't expect."
Pearlson and Young have also set
up a website for students to sign up
for appointments with BCEs.
"We're going to start doing adver
tising at the start of spring quarter
and start planning our training ses
sion," Young said.
Since several of the current BCEs
are graduating this year, Pearlson
and Young explained that they are
looking for new applicants. Although
the current educators all have back
grounds in counseling or sexual
health through other activities, they
emphasized that the most important
aspect of being a BCE is understand
ing the commitment to patients.
"Our goal is, by the time we grad
uate, to have it be a full-fledged pro
gram on campus with a strong con
nection to Yaden that will continue to
run and be sustainable for coming
years," Young said. "We're just try
ing to do the legwork for that to hap
pen."

birth control," Pearlson said. "No
body actually knows what it looks
like and how really tiny it is and how
it's not going to interfere with any
thing."
She also emphasized that an lUD
does not require daily action like tak
ing a pill and that the process is easy
to reverse at any point in time. Due to
their localized setting, hormonal
lUDs have also been shown to have
fewer side effects than estrogen-con
taining hormonal contraception
methods.

"It's basically giving women flexi
bility that they never had previously,"
Young said.
"I think it's like especially rele
vant [at Stanford]," Pearlson added.
"There are a lot of women who have
future goals of having careers and not
necessarily starting to have kids until
maybe they're thirty or late twen
ties."

Expanding outreach
Last quarter, the program sched
uled over a dozen appointments with
BCEs, and they also sold condom
roses on Valentine's Day to raise

awareness. According to Young, their
patients have been mostly graduate
students but have also included a
number of international students.
They held their first information ses
sion at the end of February and had a
turnout of six people.
"I think we weren't really antici
pating it to be very big so even hav
ing a couple people was really excit
ing for us," Pearlson said. "There
was a guy there which was really
awesome. I think birth control is
generally seen as a woman's issue,
and unfortunately, currently it most
ly is."
Senior Laura Pospisil 'l4 ex
plained that the information session
made her more aware of the re
sources Stanford provides its stu
dents.
"I definitely think that more peo
ple should at least see what's out
there [for birth control]," Pospisil
said. "I think there's this assumption
that people already know everything
there is to know about sexual health,
but... [the information session] filled
in some [gaps] for me."
Several other students who could
not make the event contacted Pearl
son and Young to learn more about
scheduling an appointment.
"We actually got a lot of emails or
text messages from people all over
campus who had heard about it,"
Young said. "It was just an exciting
time because we just sent out this fly
er and then suddenly it hit a lot of dif
ferent lists that we didn't expect."
Pearlson and Young have also set
up a website for students to sign up
for appointments with BCEs.
"We're going to start doing adver
tising at the start of spring quarter
and start planning our training ses
sion," Young said.
Since several of the current BCEs
are graduating this year, Pearlson
and Young explained that they are
looking for new applicants. Although
the current educators all have back
grounds in counseling or sexual
health through other activities, they
emphasized that the most important
aspect of being a BCE is understand
ing the commitment to patients.
"Our goal is, by the time we grad
uate, to have it be a full-fledged pro
gram on campus with a strong con
nection to Yaden that will continue to
run and be sustainable for coming
years," Young said. "We're just try

Earlier this year, the Vaden Health Center
launched a new Birth Control Peer Educators
(BCE) program that gives students the
chance to act as peer counselors on the topic of
birth control.
Program Origins
According to Julie Richards, a nurse prac
titioner in Medical Services and one of the
Vaden faculty supervisors for the program,
BCEs have existed for several years in a "pi
lot form." The counselors' names were listed
on the Vaden website.
In order to raise awareness about the
BCEs as a resource, Medical Services teamed
up with Health Promotion Services (I Thrive)
this year to hire two student coordinators
Geffan Pearlson 'l4 and Amy Young 'l4 to
manage the program.
Richards explained that many students
use Vaden for family planning services and
that clinicians receive a large amount of ques
tions about contraception. By educating pa
tients beforehand, BCEs allow patients to
come to their appointments well prepared.
"We really hope that we can provide anoth
er way for students to get accurate informa
tion about these kind of medical concerns,"
Richards said. "Then when they come to see
their clinician at Vaden, they can have a more
informed discussion and answer any addition
al questions that they have."
BCEs undergo training to learn both
counseling skills and medical information.
Richards herself helps teach counselors the
medical content they need to advise patients
on birth control.
"We wanted to provide some specific
training along those lines that would focus pri
marily on allowing the counselors to discuss
all the methods that are available," Richards
said.
Donnovan Yisrael 'B9 M.A. '9O, manager of
emotional and sexual health programs at I
Thrive, noted that the BCE program
offers students a chance to be in
volved in sexual health education and
also provides leadership opportuni
ties.
"On the end of the counselors,
they're getting their feet wet and en
joying that process of being a leader,"
Yisrael said.
Yisrael also explained that the
BCEs provide an alternative to of
ten-unreliable online resources.
"I think it's talking to another
peer about... what's involved in the
decision-making process and having
some tender loving care some
compassion and care face-to-face that
you're not going to get from the web,"
Yisrael said.
According to Pearlson and Young,
talking to peers gives students the
opportunity for one-on-one consulta
tions for which clinicians may not
have time.
"Providers don't have enough
time to really sit down with people
and go over all of their options,"
Pearlson said.
They also emphasized that the ed
ucators are not there to provide
emergency contraception or discuss
individuals' specific medical concerns.
"Our program fulfills a veiy spe
cific niche," Young said. "We're not
physicians, we are peer educators.
We're not advising people on what
birth control is right for them; we're
just telling them, 'Here are some of
your options and let's have a discus
sion.'"
The program managers
Pearlson and Young are both sen
iors studying human biology and con
sidering futures in medicine in pri
mary or preventative care. Young is
also a Peer Health Educator (PHE)
at a freshman dorm on campus.
"[l'm] very interested in behav
ioral changes and community en
gagement and more grassroots
change to positively impact health,"
Young said. "I love the idea of the em
powerment aspect of the program
that women could become more in
formed and could come into their doc
tor's office or doctor's appointment
already knowing what questions to
ask."
Pearlson has been conducting the
sis research around the topic of sexu
al health and women's health, and by

interviewing young Latino women
about family planning, she saw first
hand many of the misconceptions
surrounding birth control.
"I've had a lot of friends coming
to me asking me questions [about
birth control and sexual health],"
Pearlson said. "Now I'm formally
trained to do this, and I can actually
better answer their questions."
By working together, the two
hope to expand the program and
bring awareness about the resources
available to students on campus.
"Having the two of us spearhead
ing it is better for [Vaden] because
then we can take control of out
reach," Pearlson explained. "We've
really taken it on as our project."
Dispelling misconceptions
One of the program's main focus
es is dispelling misconceptions about
birth control. Pearlson explained
that many women do not fully under
stand the side effects of different
methods and often assume the worst
about hormonal options.
"[People think] that hormones
are these nebulous things that are
bad for you and going to make you
into a different person," Pearlson
said. "These misconceptions exist
and not only in the population that I
was interviewing but also here at
Stanford."
They explained that many people
do not realize that non-hormonal op
tions for birth control exist, with
some of the biggest misconceptions

revolving around intrauterine de
vices (lUDs).
Inserted through the cervix, an
lUD sits at the bottom of the uterus
and can be either hormonal or non
hormonal. Also known as a "long
acting reversible contraceptive,"
lUDS can last up to 12 years.

"It's more effective than steriliza
tion. It's the most effective form of
birth control," Pearlson said. "No
body actually knows what it looks
like and how really tiny it is and how
it's not going to interfere with any
thing."
She also emphasized that an lUD
does not require daily action like tak
ing a pill and that the process is easy
to reverse at any point in time. Due to
their localized setting, hormonal
lUDs have also been shown to have
fewer side effects than estrogen-con
taining hormonal contraception
methods.

"It's basically giving women flexi
bility that they never had previously,"
Young said.
"I think it's like especially rele

peer about... what's involved in the
decision-making process and having
some tender loving care some
compassion and care face-to-face that
you're not going to get from the web,"
Yisrael said.
According to Pearlson and Young,
talking to peers gives students the
opportunity for one-on-one consulta
tions for which clinicians may not
have time.
"Providers don't have enough
time to really sit down with people
and go over all of their options,"
Pearlson said.
They also emphasized that the ed
ucators are not there to provide
emergency contraception or discuss
individuals' specific medical concerns.
"Our program fulfills a veiy spe
cific niche," Young said. "We're not
physicians, we are peer educators.
We're not advising people on what
birth control is right for them; we're
just telling them, 'Here are some of
your options and let's have a discus
sion.'"
The program managers
Pearlson and Young are both sen
iors studying human biology and con
sidering futures in medicine in pri
mary or preventative care. Young is
also a Peer Health Educator (PHE)
at a freshman dorm on campus.
"[l'm] very interested in behav
ioral changes and community en
gagement and more grassroots
change to positively impact health,"
Young said. "I love the idea of the em
powerment aspect of the program
that women could become more in
formed and could come into their doc
tor's office or doctor's appointment
already knowing what questions to
ask."
Pearlson has been conducting the
sis research around the topic of sexu
al health and women's health, and by

interviewing young Latino women
about family planning, she saw first
hand many of the misconceptions
surrounding birth control.
"I've had a lot of friends coming
to me asking me questions [about
birth control and sexual health],"
Pearlson said. "Now I'm formally
trained to do this, and I can actually
better answer their questions."
By working together, the two
hope to expand the program and
bring awareness about the resources
available to students on campus.
"Having the two of us spearhead
ing it is better for [Vaden] because
then we can take control of out
reach," Pearlson explained. "We've
really taken it on as our project."
Dispelling misconceptions
One of the program's main focus
es is dispelling misconceptions about
birth control. Pearlson explained
that many women do not fully under
stand the side effects of different
methods and often assume the worst
about hormonal options.
"[People think] that hormones
are these nebulous things that are
bad for you and going to make you
into a different person," Pearlson
said. "These misconceptions exist
and not only in the population that I
was interviewing but also here at
Stanford."
They explained that many people
do not realize that non-hormonal op
tions for birth control exist, with
some of the biggest misconceptions

revolving around intrauterine de
vices (lUDs).
Inserted through the cervix, an
lUD sits at the bottom of the uterus
and can be either hormonal or non
hormonal. Also known as a "long
acting reversible contraceptive,"
lUDS can last up to 12 years.

"It's more effective than steriliza
tion. It's the most effective form of
birth control," Pearlson said. "No
body actually knows what it looks
like and how really tiny it is and how
it's not going to interfere with any
thing."
She also emphasized that an lUD
does not require daily action like tak
ing a pill and that the process is easy
to reverse at any point in time. Due to
their localized setting, hormonal
lUDs have also been shown to have
fewer side effects than estrogen-con
taining hormonal contraception
methods.

"It's basically giving women flexi
bility that they never had previously,"
Young said.
"I think it's like especially rele
vant [at Stanford]," Pearlson added.
"There are a lot of women who have
future goals of having careers and not
necessarily starting to have kids until
maybe they're thirty or late twen
ties."

Expanding outreach
Last quarter, the program sched
uled over a dozen appointments with
BCEs, and they also sold condom
roses on Valentine's Day to raise

awareness. According to Young, their
patients have been mostly graduate
students but have also included a
number of international students.
They held their first information ses
sion at the end of February and had a
turnout of six people.
"I think we weren't really antici
pating it to be very big so even hav
ing a couple people was really excit
ing for us," Pearlson said. "There
was a guy there which was really
awesome. I think birth control is
generally seen as a woman's issue,
and unfortunately, currently it most
ly is."
Senior Laura Pospisil 'l4 ex
plained that the information session
made her more aware of the re
sources Stanford provides its stu
dents.
"I definitely think that more peo
ple should at least see what's out
there [for birth control]," Pospisil
said. "I think there's this assumption
that people already know everything
there is to know about sexual health,
but... [the information session] filled
in some [gaps] for me."
Several other students who could
not make the event contacted Pearl
son and Young to learn more about
scheduling an appointment.
"We actually got a lot of emails or
text messages from people all over
campus who had heard about it,"
Young said. "It was just an exciting
time because we just sent out this fly
er and then suddenly it hit a lot of dif
ferent lists that we didn't expect."
Pearlson and Young have also set
up a website for students to sign up
for appointments with BCEs.
"We're going to start doing adver
tising at the start of spring quarter
and start planning our training ses
sion," Young said.
Since several of the current BCEs
are graduating this year, Pearlson
and Young explained that they are
looking for new applicants. Although
the current educators all have back
grounds in counseling or sexual
health through other activities, they
emphasized that the most important
aspect of being a BCE is understand
ing the commitment to patients.
"Our goal is, by the time we grad
uate, to have it be a full-fledged pro
gram on campus with a strong con
nection to Yaden that will continue to
run and be sustainable for coming
years," Young said. "We're just try
ing to do the legwork for that to hap
pen."
