## Vaden offers birth control counseling 
### KYLIE JUE DESK EDITOR 
Earlier this year, the Vaden Health Center
launched a new Birth Control Peer Educators
(BCE) program that gives students the
chance to act as peer counselors on the topic of
birth control.
Program Origins
According to Julie Richards, a nurse prac
titioner in Medical Services and one of the
Vaden faculty supervisors for the program,
BCEs have existed for several years in a "pi
lot form." The counselors' names were listed
on the Vaden website.
In order to raise awareness about the
BCEs as a resource, Medical Services teamed
up with Health Promotion Services (I Thrive)
this year to hire two student coordinators
Geffan Pearlson 'l4 and Amy Young 'l4 to
manage the program.
Richards explained that many students
use Vaden for family planning services and
that clinicians receive a large amount of ques
tions about contraception. By educating pa
tients beforehand, BCEs allow patients to
come to their appointments well prepared.
"We really hope that we can provide anoth
er way for students to get accurate informa
tion about these kind of medical concerns,"
Richards said. "Then when they come to see
their clinician at Vaden, they can have a more
informed discussion and answer any addition
al questions that they have."
BCEs undergo training to learn both
counseling skills and medical information.
Richards herself helps teach counselors the
medical content they need to advise patients
on birth control.
"We wanted to provide some specific
training along those lines that would focus pri
marily on allowing the counselors to discuss
all the methods that are available," Richards
said.
