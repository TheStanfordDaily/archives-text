## ASSU addresses student concerns on SAFE Reform bill 
### PETER MOON DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
The 15th Undergraduate
Senate convened Tuesday night
to discuss lingering concerns
about the SAFE Reform propos
al a bill meant to help simplify
the current student activities
funding system and to finalize
decisions on bills regarding
Graduate Student Council (GSC)
funding and the Green Store.
Last quarter, some students
questioned the efficacy and flexi
bility of the SAFE Reform pro
posal while others expressed
concern that their groups'
unique funding situations would
not be sustainable under the
measure's provisions. The Sen
ate framed concerns raised as
simply reflective of a need for
more transparency, better mar
keting, and clearer information
about the new funding system.
"We had a town hall meeting
today and many of the people
were supportive of the bill," said
proposal co-author Justine
Moore 'l6. "We are working on
marketing the SAFE bill, and we
will be creating info-graphics to
[make the bill more accessible

for students]."
The Senate also introduced
three bills, starting with a meas
ure to confirm student nominees
selected by the Nominations
Commission to occupy positions
on various University commit
tees. Senator John-Lancaster
Finley 'l6 discussed the prob
lems of candidates potentially
running for both the Senate and
the Board of Trustees. The Sen
ate will vote on the confirmations
of the prospective nominees next
week.

A representative from the
GSC came to the Senate meeting
to discuss a bill to fund and pro
mote tickets sales to graduate
students for a major spring
quarter concert in Frost Am
phitheater. The representative
requested a $lO,OOO withdrawal
from the graduate buffer fund to
subsidize the event in a measure
that, according to the joint by
laws, requires a two-thirds ma
jority vote from the Undergrad
uate Senate to pass.
The Undergraduate Senate
suspended the rules of order to
allow the GSC to use the buffer
fund, which effectively serves as
an emergency reserve.

The Senate closed its discus
sions with the final bill of the day
regarding the appointment of
Green Store directors. Green
Store, an online-operated joint
service project that works with
both the Senate and GSC, sells
recyclable cups and compostable
foodware. Green Store allows
registered undergraduate and
graduate student groups to buy
products, which are then deliv
ered to on-campus locations.
Susie Choi 'l2 J.D. 'l5, the co
founder of Green Store, recom
mended Christina Luu 'l6 and
Julie Zhu 'l6 as the new direc
tors.
In other news, the Senate will
hold a Senate transition confer
ence to educate members of the
16th Senate before they take of
fice later this quarter. Rachel
Samuels 'l7 commenced her Sen
ate career by serving as a proxy
for Senator Abby Dow 'l6, who is
spending the quarter abroad.
Senator Ilya Mouzykantskii 'l6
resigned his position, as he will
be spending the quarter in Rus
sia.
