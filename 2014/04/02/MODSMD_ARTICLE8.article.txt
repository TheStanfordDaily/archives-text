## Believably unbelievable April storylines 
### Vignesh Venkataraman 
The magic of April Fools'
Day is that, for a brief
span of 24 hours, the line
that we draw between
fiction and reality be
comes quite indistinct. Just yesterday
morning, I was told by Google that
they were looking for an individual to
fill the position of Pokemon Master;
needless to say, I spent the day on
Google Maps filling out my Pokedex.
Other highlights of the day includ
ed a special Linkedln exclusively for
cats, a Cheetos fragrance line, a Vir
gin America-Nest collaboration that
will allow passengers on Virgin Amer
ica flights to experience luscious cli
mates like "Cancun Afternoon" and
"Chicago Polar Vortex," a new Roset
ta Stone software for the esteemed
Klingon language and a science article
claiming the discovery of the eighth
color of the rainbow.
Although news outlets and blog
ging services have historically had ze
ro qualms about polluting the air
waves and the Internet with a combi
nation of real news and believably un
believable pranks, alas, the same
could not be said about sports. All of
the sports RSS feeds I subscribe to
sadly produced zero pranks. Even
the athletes didn't bring their A
games: Le√üron James and DeMar
cus Cousins both tried (and failed) to
fool folks into thinking they were re
leasing rap mixtapes, while the Okla
homa football team uninspiringly
tweeted that newly converted tight
end Blake Bell was switching back to
quarterback.
This simply will not do. As such, I
feel it is my personal responsibility to
make up for this sloppy showing.
Without further ado, below are some
believably unbelievable April Fools'
Day headlines that ESPN et al should
have published yesterday:
1. Tiger Woods Pulls Out of
Masters
This is the perfect storm of specu
lation married to actual facts, since
Tiger has already been complaining
about the state of his back, and... oh,
this happened for real? Sincerest
apologies. In any case, the watchabili
ty index of the Masters just went
down by a lot.
2. Kobe Reveals He Will Be Back
Next Week
At this point, would you put it past
Kobe to come back this season? He's
already been to Germany to receive
dubious stem-cell therapies, and we
all know how desperately he wants
to win more "titles" (I think this is a
euphemism for trying to catch Ka
reem on the all-time NBA scoring
leaders list). The Lakers are 18.5
games out of the eighth and final
playoff spot, with nine games left in
their season. If Kobe goes into gun
ner mode, that could be on the order
of 350 points to add to his career to
tals! To me, if this headline were re
al, I wouldn't at all be shocked. Kobe
on the floor is far more entertaining
than Kobe in a suit and tie.
3. Rafael Nadal Fires Uncle Toni
As Coach
I can see the press release now.
Citing irreconcilable differences in
cluding, but not limited to choice of at
tire, a reliance on black-magic super-

stition (a.k.a. OCD) and a con
sistent inability to beat
Djokovic in tournament finals,
Rafael Nadal and his uncle
Toni Nadal have decided to
paid ways. Rafael Nadal, the
No. 1 player in the world, stat
ed that last week's pasting to
Djokovic in the Miami Open fi
nal was the final straw. Nadal
was mum about potential re
placements, but speculation
has settled on Andre Agassi,
Pete Sampras, Roger Federer
and Djokovic's girlfriend.
4. New England Patriots
Trade Entire Stockpile of
Draft Picks, CB Devin Mc-
Courty and Tom Brady's Jock
strap for DL J.J. Watt
Despite signing Darrelle
Revis and Brandon Browner
at the onset of free agency, the
Patriots' defense remains

weak, especially along the de
fensive line; in fact, the defense
has been the team's biggest
weakness for that extended
stretch from their last Super
Bowl victory to today In that
time, coach Bill Belichick and
the front office have been ma
ligned for consistently stock
piling draft picks for the future
as opposed to spending them,
while Tom Brady's window of
opportunity to win that elusive
fourth championship continues
to slide slowly closed. At this
point, couldn't you see them
making this trade and going all
in? Teah, on second thought,
this would never happen in a
million years. One can dream
on April Fools' Day, though.
5. FIFA and UEFA An
nounce That Penalty for Simu
lation (a.k.a. Diving to Draw
Penalties) Has Been Increased
to Straight Red Card, Fol
lowed By Instant Death
This past weekend's Cham
pions League matches were
unwatchable due to the "Oh,

you brushed my leg, I'VE
BEEN SHOT" theatrics.
Maybe this will finally deter
the Ashley Youngs and Arjen
Robbens and Neymars of the
world.

6. Stanford Daily Colum
nist Vignesh Venkataraman
Renounces His Position As
The Lord of Hyperbole
Dream on, world. Dream
on.
