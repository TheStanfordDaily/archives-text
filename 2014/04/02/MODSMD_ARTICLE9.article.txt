# Golf breaks competition
## 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
For most Stanford students,
last week was a lazy one at best,
utilized for some much-needed
down time: catching up on sleep af
ter a tiresome winter quarter or
enjoying the spring weather at the
beach. But in the case of the Stan
ford men's and women's golf
teams, the end of finals meant a re
turn to the tee box, fairways and
greens. From the results, it seems
the view of the bunkers was all the
sand the Card's players needed to
see to have a great week.
On the women's side, No. 4
Stanford headed south to the San
Diego State Farms Invitational and
captured second place in the strong
field that included heavyweights
No. 1 USC, No. 2 UCLA and No. 6
Arizona State. Head coach Anne
Walker's lineup, which saw the in
sertion of senior Marissa Mar in
place of freshman Quirine Eijken
boom, fired a 2-over 290 to begin
the three-day, 54-hole event.
Sitting five shots behind the
Bruins after the first round, the
Cardinal reduced the advantage by
one stroke by the end of Tuesday's
frame and had three players
sophomores Mariah Stackhouse
and Lauren Kim, as well as fresh
men Casey Danielson in the
tournament's individual top 10.
Danielson, a mainstay in Walker's
lineup throughout the fall and
spring seasons, has played ex
tremely well of late; the Wisconsin
native has seemingly been thriving
in the mild winter weather and has
been her team's number-one or
number-two performer in each of
Stanford's past four events.
"I think her belief in herself has
been at its peak over the past few

events," said Kim of Danielson.
"She exudes more confidence now
than she did at the beginning of the
year and acts more like she be
longs. I think this definitely comes
from the way Coach [Walker] has
been working on developing her
game physically. She's learned new
shots and tightened up her me
chanics, which gives her confidence
in tournament play."
Danielson certainly played
liked she belonged at the front in
San Diego, carding a 4-under 68 on
Tuesday to shake off an up-and
down first round that included a
double-bogey on the par-4 seventh
hole. She would go on to finish
third individually, one place behind
Kim, who led the Card with a 6-un
der 210 cumulative score. Kim was
especially efficient on the par-ss:
she shot 7-under on twelve such
holes over the course of the event.

"I knew I had birdied quite a
few of the par-5s but in the end, I
was suiprised at how well I actual
ly played them," Kim stated. "I was
really confident in my wedge game
this tournament, and I think that
was key in helping me play the par
-5s well. Most of my approach shots
into the greens left me makeable
putts and plenty of opportunities."
Although the men's squad did
not enjoy the same sunny weather
as its female counterpart, its spring
break event nonetheless produced
the desired results.

Playing competitively at home
for the first and only time this sea
son, the No. 6 Stanford men's golf
team easily outpaced the field at
The Goodwin to collect the victory.
The event, formally called the U.S.
Intercollegiate, was renamed after
legendary Cardinal golf coach Wal-

top performers over the team's past four events. She finished
third individually with a 5-under 211 in San Diego last week.
ly Goodwin, who was at the
helm of the program from
1987 to 2000 and was in at
tendance. Goodwin men
tored, among other players,
current Stanford head coach
Conrad Ray and PGA Tour
professionals Tiger Woods,
Notah Begay 111 and Casey
Martin.
And the Cardinal deliv
ered a spectacular perform
ance for the former coach,
punctuated by junior Patrick
Rodgers' third straight win.
Rodgers, who last month an
nounced his intention to turn
professional after this sea
son's conclusion, flew out of
the gates with an opening
round 7-under 63, creating a
three-shot lead he would nev
er relinquish. Subsequent
rounds of 69 and 64 brought
him to 14-under-par for the
tournament, six strokes clear
of Rico Hoey of USC and
eight ahead of teammate
Cameron Wilson.
"The guys really had a
great weekend," Ray said.
"We battled a little bit of

weather on Saturday, but we
had some contributions
across the board from all five
players. It was neat to see
the guys bounce back from fi
nals and Dead Week and play
well."
Besides the strong per
formances from Rodgers and
Wilson, Stanford also bene
fitted from a solid outing by
freshman Maverick Mc-
Nealy. McNealy, who has
struggled with his consisten
cy in his first year as a colle
giate golfer, finished in a
three-way tie for fourth. The
Bay Area product's high
placing was anchored by an
excellent opening round that
saw him hole two eagles in
his first seven holes en route
to a 4-under 66.
Both the men's and
women's squads have one
regular season tournament
left before turning their at
tention towards the Pac-12
Tournament and NCAA play.
The women will conclude at
the PING/ASU Invitational
starting Friday, with the men
wrapping up their slate at the
Western Intercollegiate be
ginning on April 12.
