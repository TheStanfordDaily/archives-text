and Beyond—The Evolution of Form
m
m
Friday, April 4
8:00 pm
Dinkelspiel Auditorium
Stanford University
Free and open to public
Stanford teacher and actor Kay Kostopoulos conceived
Black Olive Jazz with two key ideas in mind: She wanted
to draw from both her acting background and her
Mediterranean heritage to establish a unique sound in jazz.
With the inspiration and generosity of her jazz mentors,
she has been able to bring this vision to audiences all
around the Bay Area.
Join us for this special concert that will feature Kay
Kostopoulos on vocals, with master musicians from the
local jazz scene: Larry Vuckovich on piano, Noel Jewkes
on multiple reeds, and an exotic rhythm section with
Akira Tana and Vince Delgado. The concert will trace
an evolution of jazz from film and the Broadway stage to
jazz standards, culminating in an homage to such enduring
masters as Duke Ellington and Dizzy Gillespie and their
groundbreaking offerings to the world music genre.
