# TOUGH TEST IN TEMPE
## 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
With Mother Nature rearing her ugly head
on the Stanford campus this week in the form of
one cloud burst after another, the Cardinal
women's golf team will surely be happy to escape
to the desert this weekend for its final tune-up
before postseason play begins. Anne Walker's

quintet headlined by sophomores Mariah
Stackhouse and Lauren Kim will look to repli
cate its glowing performance from the 2013
PING/ASU Invitational at this year's iteration of
the event, which begins Friday in Tempe, Ariz.
In what essentially amounts to a Pac-12 Tour
nament preview, the PING/ASU field will fea
ture eight of Stanford's conference foes, includ
ing fellow top-10 teams UCLA, Arizona State,

Arizona and Washington. The competition fig
ures to be the strongest the Card has faced all
year, with nine of the NCAA's top 12 squads
scheduled to compete on the Karsten Golf
Course. However, the Cardinal are not using this
event as a measuring stick to see how they stack
up against them Pac-12 opponents; rather, they
are focused on continuing them solid play of late
and building momentum with the postseason
looming.

"We are lucky to play in such a competitive
conference with six of the nation's top-10 teams,"
Walker said. "However, we are not so focused on
proving ourselves within the conference â€”we
have shown multiple times this year that we are
one of the best teams. We are more intent on
staying in the present and working on reaching
our peak performance state on a more regular
basis."

Stanford has certainly made big strides to
wards that goal over its first four spring tourna
ments, turning in two team victories and a run
ner-up finish. That recent stretch of play has
created great momentum for the young squad
as it readies itself for the championship portion
of its schedule. More importantly, though, the
Card has seen its depth blossom tremendously
over the past few months, with three different
players tallying the team's lowest score in as
many events. Key to this encouraging trend has
been the strong efforts from freshman Casey
Danielson, who has stepped up her game and
solidified herself as the squad's third-best play
er a much-needed boost, considering the
slump junior Mariko Tumangan seems to be
mired in.

"I think we have been getting better each
week and seeing multiple players contribute to
our team's success," Walker commented. "We
have three weeks before conference; we will be
looking closely at our stats and making some fi
nal adjustments to brush up on areas before we
head to [Oregon for the Pac-12 Championships]."
One of the aspects that the Cardinal are hop
ing to improve on at PING/ASU is what Stack
house called "course management." With the
wind likely to blow in Tempe, it will be incumbent
upon Stanford to give each shot the attention it
deserves, make committed swings and pick up
good shot lines. Stackhouse's experience at the
LPGA Tour's Kia Classic last weekend where
she missed the cut reminded her that taking
one's time is often the best strategy.
"The Kia Classic definitely showed me that I
need to put a lot more focus back into smart
course management, rather than quick deci
sions," Stackhouse admitted. "The amount of
time spent on approach shots and strategy defi-
