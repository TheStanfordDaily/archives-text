## Card to play Pacific, CBU in Maples finales 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's volleyball (16-7, 13-7
MPSF) is set to play its last two home
matches of the season this week against Pa
cific (2-21, 1-16) today and California Bap
tist (4-20, 2-18) tomorrow. The Card enter
the contests on a seven-match winning
streak, not having lost a match since Feb.
28. Undefeated in the month of March,
Stanford is now ranked fourth nationally
and is in a strong position heading into the
postseason.
John Kosty's squad defeated No. 3 Pep
perdine and No. 7 USC last week at Maples,

time this season and the final time in the
foreseeable future. While the two teams
have a long-standing series, the Tigers' ath

men's volleyball. The two neighboring
schools have consistently played each other
and are in the same conference, but Pacific
has not beaten Stanford in years and was
swept by Stanford earlier this season.
Stanford's strongest tool is its strong
and consistent offense. Sophomore setter
James Shaw is at the center of this offense,
providing consistent passing that allows for
dominant net play. The Card is third nation
ally in both hitting percentage and kills per
set, connecting for 13.71 kills per set while
hitting at a .334 clip.
Senior outside hitters Brian Cook and
Steven Irvin have led the hitting attack.
Cook averages 3.67 kills per set while Irvin
3.36 kills per set and both provide critical
