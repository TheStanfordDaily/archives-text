## Card to play Pacific, CBU in Maples finales 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's volleyball (16-7, 13-7
MPSF) is set to play its last two home
matches of the season this week against Pa
cific (2-21, 1-16) today and California Bap
tist (4-20, 2-18) tomorrow. The Card enter
the contests on a seven-match winning
streak, not having lost a match since Feb.
28. Undefeated in the month of March,
Stanford is now ranked fourth nationally
and is in a strong position heading into the
postseason.
John Kosty's squad defeated No. 3 Pep
perdine and No. 7 USC last week at Maples,
improving its conference record to 13-7.
With only four matches left in the regular
season, Stanford is looking to continue its
winning ways and gain more momentum
heading into the conference tournament on
its quest for a national title.
But before Stanford can turn its atten
tion to the postseason, it must focus on the
last four matches of the season. Thursday,

Stanford will face Pacific for the second
time this season and the final time in the
foreseeable future. While the two teams
have a long-standing series, the Tigers' ath
letic department recently announced that
this would be the school's final season of
men's volleyball. The two neighboring
schools have consistently played each other
and are in the same conference, but Pacific
has not beaten Stanford in years and was
swept by Stanford earlier this season.
Stanford's strongest tool is its strong
and consistent offense. Sophomore setter
James Shaw is at the center of this offense,
providing consistent passing that allows for
dominant net play. The Card is third nation
ally in both hitting percentage and kills per
set, connecting for 13.71 kills per set while
hitting at a .334 clip.
Senior outside hitters Brian Cook and
Steven Irvin have led the hitting attack.
Cook averages 3.67 kills per set while Irvin
3.36 kills per set and both provide critical
experience and leadership
to the team. Both players
have experience closing out
a season and know how to
head into the postseason
with the right mindset. If the
two seniors play well and
demonstrate their leader
ship and poise in the upcom
ing matches, Stanford will
continue to be successful and
gain even more confidence
heading into the postseason.
Another key to the
Card's recent success has
been its service game. Stan
ford has capitalized off aces,
averaging 1.43 per set
seventh in the nation. If the
Cardinal continues its hot
serving ways, the Tigers and
Lancers stand little chance
at Maples Pavilion this
weekend.
For Pacific, freshman
outside hitter Thomas
Hodges leads the team with
an average of 3.32 kills and
1.14 blocks per set. Another
key factor for Pacific's of
fense is junior middle block
er Tommy Carmody, who av
erages 1.85 kills per match
on a .315 hitting percentage.
Stanford's defense so far
this season has been very
strong in limiting teams to
fewer hits than normal, con
sistently forcing opponents
into more errors and poor
hitting percentages. If Stan
ford can achieve these
things, Pacific's offense will
have no answer. More im

portantly, if Stanford plays
with the same high intensity
and strong hitting power it
has displayed throughout
the second half of the sea
son, it should dominate the
Tigers' defense.
Stanford will host Pacific

today at 7 p.m., with the
match against Cal Baptist
also at 7 p.m. on Friday in its
final two home matches of
the season.
