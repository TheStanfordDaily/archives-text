## THE 						DEVIL'S ADVOCATE Censors at Stanford 
### Jason Willick 
Earlier this year, Harvard
Crimson columnist Sandra
Korn ignited a national de
bate by arguing that Harvard
should "give up on academic free
dom" or more precisely, give up
on academic freedom for those who
challenge her worldview. "When an
academic community observes re
search promoting or justifying op
pression, it should ensure that this
research does not continue," she
said bluntly. "Why... should we put
up with research that counters our
goals?"

One Crimson commenter
pointed out that in a previous age,
Galileo's deeply offensive heliocen
trism probably would not have sur
vived Ms. Korn's censorious scruti
ny. But Korn has trouble finding
any actual examples of people who
should be censored at Harvard in
2014, as the political scientist
Patrick Deneen observed. The only
person she can come up with is
Harvey Mansfield "a single con
servative octogenerian," whom, Ko
rn suggests, should not have been
allowed to publish one of his books.
Right-wing views are so rare on
modern elite campuses that left
wing calls for censorship are barely
necessary.

A similar irony is present in the
activities of anti-free speech ac
tivists on Stanford's campus. Those
few campus organizations they
want to suppress are small and po
litically powerless, so the anti-free
speech activists have no problem
overpowering them with their su
perior political muscle.
I'm referring, most recently to
the Graduate Student Council's de
cision to revoke the funding for a
conference hosted by the Stanford
Anscombe Society, a little-known,
socially conservative group. The
conference in question, called
"Marriage, Family and the Media,"
is intended to "promote the values
of marriage, family and integrity to
the broader popular culture." The
Council initially granted the
Anscombe Society's request for
$6OO dollars of funding, but with
drew the money last month after an
outcry over the Anscombe Soci
ety's view that marriage is "a
union, until death, between one
man and one woman," as well as the
list of speakers, which includes
scholars who have argued against
same-sex marriage.
For those of us who care about
free inquiry and a marketplace of
ideas that is, those of us who
think the Enlightenment was a
good thing and the American liber
al tradition has it right the min
utes from the Council meeting are
truly painful to read. The President
of the Undergraduate Senate, Ben
Holston, said "this event as it
stands ... given that they have said
the event is supposed to 'promote
one-man, one-woman'... is unac
ceptable on [the] Stanford cam
pus." This is a truly remarkable
statement: The tiny minority of
Stanford students who oppose
same-sex marriage aren't just
wrong they shouldn't even he
allowed to make their case,

Brianne Huntsman, who organ
ized opposition to the event, said
that "Stanford is supposed to be a
safe space" for gay and lesbian stu
dents and that the event would
make Stanford "unsafe." Naturally,
she cited no evidence that the event
would threaten anyone's safety.
That's because, as people who fol
low these types of debates know,
"unsafe" can be an Orwellian code
word a trump card that anti-free
speech activists sometimes use to

shut down ideas they disagree with.
As one of the invited speakers,
Ryan Anderson, noted wryly on
Twitter: "I lectured at Stanford's
Law School last year. No one's safe
ty was harmed in the process."
Moreover, one member of the
Council, Eduardo Gonzales-Monal
do, said the student government
"would not fund any event that
makes anyone feel unwelcome or
uncomfortable." This is an absurd
proposition. If it were upheld in
practice, it would mean that politi
cal student groups from the Stu
dents for Palestinian Equal Rights
to the Stanford Libertarians
would be virtually unable to hold
any events at all. Any students who
claimed offense would have veto
power, and political dialogue on
campus would wither and die.
The question that bewilders me
most about these students' intoler
ance of dissent on this issue is:
What are they afraid of? The vast
majority of Stanford students
myself very much included! sup
port same-sex marriage rights. The
reason we support same-sex mar
riage rights is because its propo
nents have made a much more com
pelling case not because they
systematically suppressed those
who disagreed. Indeed, for much of
its history, the gay rights move
ment has been a victim of uncon
scionable political censorship. The
Council's attempt to suppress this
conference is a betrayal of the prin
ciples of tolerance and fairness that
the gay rights movement has al
ways embraced.
To make matters worse, the lob
bying effort by Stanford's anti-free
speech activists led the university
administration to impose an addi
tional $5,600 dollar "security fee"
on the event, even though the
Anscombe Society never requested
any security. After a media outcry,
the administration "found" funds to
pay for security. But the Council
continues to withhold the $6OO that
it initially granted the group.
As the Foundation for Individ
ual Rights in Education has pointed
out, the Council's action may well
be unlawful under California's
Leonard Law, which prohibits uni
versities from engaging in view
point discrimination in the distribu
tion of funds collected through stu
dent fees.
It is disturbing that the Council
can get away with this. But it is
even more disturbing and omi
nous for the future of our democra
cy that Stanford's student lead
ers all seem to agree that suppres
sion and coercion, rather than dia
logue and debate, is the appropri
ate response to dissenting ideas.

of marriage, family and integrity to
the broader popular culture." The
Council initially granted the
Anscombe Society's request for
$6OO dollars of funding, but with
drew the money last month after an
outcry over the Anscombe Soci
ety's view that marriage is "a
union, until death, between one
man and one woman," as well as the
list of speakers, which includes
scholars who have argued against
same-sex marriage.
For those of us who care about
free inquiry and a marketplace of
ideas that is, those of us who
think the Enlightenment was a
good thing and the American liber
al tradition has it right the min
utes from the Council meeting are
truly painful to read. The President
of the Undergraduate Senate, Ben
Holston, said "this event as it
stands ... given that they have said
the event is supposed to 'promote
one-man, one-woman'... is unac
ceptable on [the] Stanford cam
pus." This is a truly remarkable
statement: The tiny minority of
Stanford students who oppose
same-sex marriage aren't just
wrong they shouldn't even he
allowed to make their case,

Brianne Huntsman, who organ
ized opposition to the event, said
that "Stanford is supposed to be a
safe space" for gay and lesbian stu
dents and that the event would
make Stanford "unsafe." Naturally,
she cited no evidence that the event
would threaten anyone's safety.
That's because, as people who fol
low these types of debates know,
"unsafe" can be an Orwellian code
word a trump card that anti-free
speech activists sometimes use to

shut down ideas they disagree with.
As one of the invited speakers,
Ryan Anderson, noted wryly on
Twitter: "I lectured at Stanford's
Law School last year. No one's safe
ty was harmed in the process."
Moreover, one member of the
Council, Eduardo Gonzales-Monal
do, said the student government
"would not fund any event that
makes anyone feel unwelcome or
uncomfortable." This is an absurd
proposition. If it were upheld in
practice, it would mean that politi
cal student groups from the Stu
dents for Palestinian Equal Rights
to the Stanford Libertarians
would be virtually unable to hold
any events at all. Any students who
claimed offense would have veto
power, and political dialogue on
campus would wither and die.
The question that bewilders me
most about these students' intoler
ance of dissent on this issue is:
What are they afraid of? The vast
majority of Stanford students
myself very much included! sup
port same-sex marriage rights. The
reason we support same-sex mar
riage rights is because its propo
nents have made a much more com
pelling case not because they
systematically suppressed those
who disagreed. Indeed, for much of
its history, the gay rights move
ment has been a victim of uncon
scionable political censorship. The
Council's attempt to suppress this
conference is a betrayal of the prin
ciples of tolerance and fairness that
the gay rights movement has al
ways embraced.
To make matters worse, the lob
bying effort by Stanford's anti-free
speech activists led the university
administration to impose an addi
tional $5,600 dollar "security fee"
on the event, even though the
Anscombe Society never requested
any security. After a media outcry,
the administration "found" funds to
pay for security. But the Council
continues to withhold the $6OO that
it initially granted the group.
As the Foundation for Individ
ual Rights in Education has pointed
out, the Council's action may well
be unlawful under California's
Leonard Law, which prohibits uni
versities from engaging in view
point discrimination in the distribu
tion of funds collected through stu
dent fees.
It is disturbing that the Council
can get away with this. But it is
even more disturbing and omi
nous for the future of our democra
cy that Stanford's student lead
ers all seem to agree that suppres
sion and coercion, rather than dia
logue and debate, is the appropri
ate response to dissenting ideas.

The question
that bewilders
me most about
these students'
intolerance of
dissent is: What
are they afraid of,?
Earlier this year, Harvard
Crimson columnist Sandra
Korn ignited a national de
bate by arguing that Harvard
should "give up on academic free
dom" or more precisely, give up
on academic freedom for those who
challenge her worldview. "When an
academic community observes re
search promoting or justifying op
pression, it should ensure that this
research does not continue," she
said bluntly. "Why... should we put
up with research that counters our
goals?"

One Crimson commenter
pointed out that in a previous age,
Galileo's deeply offensive heliocen
trism probably would not have sur
vived Ms. Korn's censorious scruti
ny. But Korn has trouble finding
any actual examples of people who
should be censored at Harvard in
2014, as the political scientist
Patrick Deneen observed. The only
person she can come up with is
Harvey Mansfield "a single con
servative octogenerian," whom, Ko
rn suggests, should not have been
allowed to publish one of his books.
Right-wing views are so rare on
modern elite campuses that left
wing calls for censorship are barely
necessary.

A similar irony is present in the
activities of anti-free speech ac
tivists on Stanford's campus. Those
few campus organizations they
want to suppress are small and po
litically powerless, so the anti-free
speech activists have no problem
overpowering them with their su
perior political muscle.
I'm referring, most recently to
the Graduate Student Council's de
cision to revoke the funding for a
conference hosted by the Stanford
Anscombe Society, a little-known,
socially conservative group. The

"Marriage, Family and the Media,"
is intended to "promote the values
