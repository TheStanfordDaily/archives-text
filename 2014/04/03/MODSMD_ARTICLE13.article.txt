# THE 						COURT AND THE CONSTITUTION
## Recess Appointments and Presidential Authority 
### Thomas Fu David Friedman 
"T ~T Then the Supreme Court is in
11\ session, constitutional law
V V comes to the fore of Ameri
can politics. To explain how the
Court makes its decisions and why
these decisions matter, it can be use
ful to think of constitutional law as
raising two distinct types of ques
tions.

First-order questions involve de
cisions about the fundamental rules
governing our democracy and socie
ty. They frequently implicate the
limits on government power and of
ten are the sexy kinds of legal issues
that make headlines. Think of the
debate on whether state universities
may use race-based affirmative ac
tion procedures.
Second-order questions involve
decisions about who has the author
ity to decide the first-order ques
tions. For example, should the
courts or the president determine
whether drone strikes against
American citizens abroad are consti
tutional? What are the limits of the
president's ability to wage war with
out Congressional approval?
Though not nearly as headline
ready as the first-order questions,
second-order questions are never
theless important and interesting in
their own right. And though they are
often politicized, they nevertheless
have the potential to attract a bipar
tisan consensus. As Professor Akhil
Amar explained, they raise the dis
tinct possibility that "even if people
violently disagree about what the
law in a given area was or ought to
be... they [might] nevertheless
agree that the legal decision in that
area ought to be made by a given le
gal institution... acting under certain
specified rules of operation."
NLRB v. Noel Canning, a
case currently before the Supreme
Court, brings both first- and second
order questions to the fore. The
first-order questions (and the ques
tions on which the Supreme Court
officially granted review) concern
the scope of the president's recess
appointments power. But while the
scope of the president's recess-ap
pointments power is undoubtedly
interesting in its own right, what
makes Noel Canning a particular
ly fascinating case is the second-or
der constitutional question underly
ing it: Who ought to have the au
thority to define the scope of the re
cess-appointments power?
First, some context. In general,

high-level presidential appoint
ments require approval by the Sen
ate. The recess appointment power
allows the president to temporarily
appoint nominees without Senate
approval while the Senate is in a re
cess. While this provision was origi
nally intended as a practical safety
valve to keep the federal govern
ment running, particularly in the
Founding Era when the Senate was
often not in session (and when call
ing senators back to Washington
solely to approve nominees was im
practicable), it has since become a
tool employed by presidents to avoid
subjecting some (controversial)
nominees to a Senate vote. Most re
cently, congressional gridlock over
congressional appointments has of
ten tempted President Obama to
make more recess appointments.
Despite the importance of recess
appointments to the functioning of
the federal government, the text of
the Constitution itself provides little
elaboration on the scope of the re
cess-appointments power, stating
simply that "[t]he President shall
have Power to fill up all Vacancies
that may happen during the Recess
of the Senate, by granting Commis
sions which shall expire at the End
of their next Session." Notably, no
further explanation is provided re
garding what a "recess" is or what it
means for a vacancy to "happen dur
ing" a recess.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, these
are precisely the points of disagree
ment between the parties in Noel
Canning. One side Noel Can
ning, a company challenging a num
ber of President Obama's recess ap
pointments to the National Labor
Relations Board argues that "re
cess" refers only to the time be
tween official sessions of Congress,
not adjournments within an official
session, and that the recess-appoint
ments power applies only to posi
tions that become vacant during a
recess, not to all positions that hap
pen to be vacant during a recess.
The Obama Administration, defend
ing its appointments to the NLRB,
has taken the opposite view on both
of these points.
After Senate Majority Leader
Harry Reid used the so-called "nu
clear option" to change the Senate's
rules governing presidential ap
pointments, the particular issue it
self is somewhat academic. Howev
er, Reid's action did not resolve the

issue of who, ultimately, has the
right to determine the answers to
these questions.
Until now, the answer has been,
emphatically, not the Court. Indeed,
for many years, the president and
the Senate have operated under a
mutual understanding that any ad
journment of the Senate longer than
three days (the Senate sometimes
adjourns early for three-day week
ends) would constitute a recess, and
that the recess-appointments power
would extend to any position that
happened to be vacant during such a
recess. This compromise allowed
the president to appoint some nomi
nees without Senate approval if he
was willing to wait until a recess,
and it allowed the Senate to block
particularly objectionable recess ap
pointments by holding so-called pro
forma sessions of the Senate
whereby a single senator would
open the Senate for business and
then promptly adjourn every three
days to avoid the occurrence of a re
cess.
In Noel Canning, however, all
of this seems likely to change. At oral
argument, most of the justices
seemed convinced that the text of
the Constitution failed to support
but indeed belied the compromise
understanding of the recess-appoint
ments power, thrusting the second
order question into the fore. As Jus
tice Scalia asked the Obama Admin
istration's lawyer: "What do you do
when there is a practice that... flatly
contradicts a clear text of the Consti
tution? ... [Wjhich of the two pre
vails?"
With the necessity of recess ap
pointments having been obviated by
the Senate's recent changes to the
filibuster rules, how the Court
thinks about this question, and more
generally, the roles of the various
branches in determining constitu
tional questions, may well be the
most important part of its decision.
The Court declared in its very infan
cy that "it is emphatically the
province and duty of the judicial de
partment to say what the law is."
But how far that authority extends
within the halls of Congress itself is
another question entirely.

the Senate's recent changes to the

thinks about this question, and more
generally, the roles of the various

V V comes to the fore of Ameri
can politics. To explain how the
Court makes its decisions and why
these decisions matter, it can be use
ful to think of constitutional law as
raising two distinct types of ques
tions.

First-order questions involve de
cisions about the fundamental rules
governing our democracy and socie
ty. They frequently implicate the
limits on government power and of
ten are the sexy kinds of legal issues
that make headlines. Think of the
debate on whether state universities
may use race-based affirmative ac
tion procedures.
Second-order questions involve
decisions about who has the author
ity to decide the first-order ques
tions. For example, should the
courts or the president determine
whether drone strikes against
American citizens abroad are consti
tutional? What are the limits of the
president's ability to wage war with
out Congressional approval?
Though not nearly as headline
ready as the first-order questions,
second-order questions are never
theless important and interesting in
their own right. And though they are
often politicized, they nevertheless
have the potential to attract a bipar
tisan consensus. As Professor Akhil
Amar explained, they raise the dis
tinct possibility that "even if people
violently disagree about what the
law in a given area was or ought to
be... they [might] nevertheless
agree that the legal decision in that
area ought to be made by a given le
gal institution... acting under certain
specified rules of operation."
NLRB v. Noel Canning, a
case currently before the Supreme
Court, brings both first- and second
order questions to the fore. The
first-order questions (and the ques
tions on which the Supreme Court
officially granted review) concern
the scope of the president's recess
appointments power. But while the
scope of the president's recess-ap
pointments power is undoubtedly
interesting in its own right, what
makes Noel Canning a particular
ly fascinating case is the second-or
der constitutional question underly
ing it: Who ought to have the au
thority to define the scope of the re
cess-appointments power?
First, some context. In general,

high-level presidential appoint
ments require approval by the Sen
ate. The recess appointment power
allows the president to temporarily
appoint nominees without Senate
approval while the Senate is in a re
cess. While this provision was origi
nally intended as a practical safety
valve to keep the federal govern
ment running, particularly in the
Founding Era when the Senate was
often not in session (and when call
ing senators back to Washington
solely to approve nominees was im
practicable), it has since become a
tool employed by presidents to avoid
subjecting some (controversial)
nominees to a Senate vote. Most re
cently, congressional gridlock over
congressional appointments has of
ten tempted President Obama to
make more recess appointments.
Despite the importance of recess
appointments to the functioning of
the federal government, the text of
the Constitution itself provides little
elaboration on the scope of the re
cess-appointments power, stating
simply that "[t]he President shall
have Power to fill up all Vacancies
that may happen during the Recess
of the Senate, by granting Commis
sions which shall expire at the End
of their next Session." Notably, no
further explanation is provided re
garding what a "recess" is or what it
means for a vacancy to "happen dur
ing" a recess.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, these
are precisely the points of disagree
ment between the parties in Noel
Canning. One side Noel Can
ning, a company challenging a num
ber of President Obama's recess ap
pointments to the National Labor
Relations Board argues that "re
cess" refers only to the time be
tween official sessions of Congress,
not adjournments within an official
session, and that the recess-appoint
ments power applies only to posi
tions that become vacant during a
recess, not to all positions that hap
pen to be vacant during a recess.
The Obama Administration, defend
ing its appointments to the NLRB,
has taken the opposite view on both
of these points.
After Senate Majority Leader
Harry Reid used the so-called "nu
clear option" to change the Senate's
rules governing presidential ap
pointments, the particular issue it
self is somewhat academic. Howev
er, Reid's action did not resolve the

issue of who, ultimately, has the
right to determine the answers to
these questions.
Until now, the answer has been,
emphatically, not the Court. Indeed,
for many years, the president and
the Senate have operated under a
mutual understanding that any ad
journment of the Senate longer than
three days (the Senate sometimes
adjourns early for three-day week
ends) would constitute a recess, and
that the recess-appointments power
would extend to any position that
happened to be vacant during such a
recess. This compromise allowed
the president to appoint some nomi
nees without Senate approval if he
was willing to wait until a recess,
and it allowed the Senate to block
particularly objectionable recess ap
pointments by holding so-called pro
forma sessions of the Senate
whereby a single senator would
open the Senate for business and
then promptly adjourn every three
days to avoid the occurrence of a re
cess.
In Noel Canning, however, all
of this seems likely to change. At oral
argument, most of the justices
seemed convinced that the text of
the Constitution failed to support
but indeed belied the compromise
understanding of the recess-appoint
ments power, thrusting the second
order question into the fore. As Jus
tice Scalia asked the Obama Admin
istration's lawyer: "What do you do
when there is a practice that... flatly
contradicts a clear text of the Consti
tution? ... [Wjhich of the two pre
vails?"
