# Colorado competition to test streak
## 
### KRISHNA BASSI 
Just past the halfway point of its
season, the No. 8 Stanford women's
lacrosse team (8-1, 2-0 MPSF) will
welcome the Denver Pioneers (9-1,3-
0) and the Colorado Buffaloes (4-5, 2-
1) to the Farm this weekend for a pair
of crucial conference matchups.
The Cardinal increased their win
ning streak to six games and im
proved their record to 8-1 when they
upset No. 6 Notre Dame (8-4) 11-10
last Saturday in South Bend, Ind.
Sophomore midfielder Lucy Dikeou
led the Cardinal with four goals, in
cluding the game-winner, and was
named the MPSF Offensive Player of
the Week for her efforts.
Stanford will also look to continue
its solid defense, led by senior goalie
Lyndsey Munoz. The Crofton, Md.
native has 55 saves on the season, an
average of about six per game. She,
along with senior defender Megan
Lerner, who last year was an All-
MPSF First Team selection, must
continue to anchor the defense for the
Cardinal to prove successful this
weekend.
On the offensive side, junior mid
fielder Hannah Farr also an All-
MPSF first-teamer and the MPSF
Tournament's Most Outstanding
Player in 2013 will certainly look
to spearhead the Cardinal's attack.
She has 15 goals, four assists and 22
ground ball pick-ups through nine
games this season. Additionally, soph
omore midfielder Meg Lentz, with 15
goals and four assists, and senior at
tacker Rachel Ozer, with 14 goals and
eight assists, will remain key cogs in
Stanford's offensive plans. Aside
from the Cardinal's established stars,
attention should be paid to freshman
attacker Kelsey Murray. She scored a
combined four goals and four assists

during victories on the road against
Cornell and Notre Dame, garnering
MPSF Rookie of the Week honors,
and could be on the verge of a break
out that could potentially propel
Stanford to the next level.
The Cardinal will look to extend
their six-match winning streak when
they face Denver on Friday. Last
year, Stanford defeated the Pioneers
7-6 to win its eighth MPSF Tourna
ment title in nine years. Denver fig
ures to be the tougher competition of
the Friday-Sunday doubleheader for
the Card. Coming off a tremendous
20-4 victory over St. Mary's last Sun
day, the Pioneers have now run their
own unbeaten streak to seven games.
Junior attacker Jill Remenapp and
senior midfielder Meredith Harris,
who have combined for 44 goals and
40 assists on the season, lead their of
fense.

Denver also has great depth, as
evidenced by the twelve different
players who contributed at least one
point in their last match. The Pio
neers figure to be a significant test
for the Cardinal, particularly for
Stanford's offense. Denver ranks
10th in the NCAA in scoring defense
this season, having allowed a paltry
75 goals in ten games. The Pioneers
have also fared better against the
teams' common opponent, Vanderbilt,
by virtue of a 10-8 victory. Stanford,
meanwhile, lost 16-15 to the Com
modores in a close overtime match
the team's only loss of the campaign
thus far. Regardless, Stanford should
be favored by virtue of its results
against tougher competition. The
Cardinal will be Denver's first top-20
opponent of the season.
On Sunday, Stanford will then face
a Colorado team playing its inaugural
season of women's lacrosse. While
the Cardinal loom as the heavy fa

vorite in this matchup, the Buffs are
coming off a convincing win 19-5
against St. Mary's. Bay Area native
Cali Castagnola, a freshman attacker
who scored four goals on four shots to
go with one assist against the Gaels,
leads the Buffs. Alongside Castagno
la, freshman midfielder Marie Moore
and freshman attacker Amelia Brown
are strong and impactful players who

will look to spur the young Buffs past
the experienced Cardinal.
Stanford faces Denver on 7 p.m.
on Friday, while Sunday's contest
against Colorado commences at 1
p.m. Pac-12 Networks will televise
both games.

Sophomore midfielder Lucy Dikeou (above) is second on the squad with
21 total points, totaling 14 goals and seven assists in nine matches. Her
home-state teams Denver and Colorado will visit the Farm this weekend.
Just past the halfway point of its
season, the No. 8 Stanford women's
lacrosse team (8-1, 2-0 MPSF) will
welcome the Denver Pioneers (9-1,3-
0) and the Colorado Buffaloes (4-5, 2-
1) to the Farm this weekend for a pair
of crucial conference matchups.
The Cardinal increased their win
ning streak to six games and im
proved their record to 8-1 when they
upset No. 6 Notre Dame (8-4) 11-10
last Saturday in South Bend, Ind.
Sophomore midfielder Lucy Dikeou
led the Cardinal with four goals, in
cluding the game-winner, and was
named the MPSF Offensive Player of
the Week for her efforts.
Stanford will also look to continue
its solid defense, led by senior goalie
Lyndsey Munoz. The Crofton, Md.
native has 55 saves on the season, an
average of about six per game. She,
along with senior defender Megan
Lerner, who last year was an All-
MPSF First Team selection, must
continue to anchor the defense for the
Cardinal to prove successful this
weekend.
On the offensive side, junior mid
fielder Hannah Farr also an All-
MPSF first-teamer and the MPSF
Tournament's Most Outstanding
Player in 2013 will certainly look
to spearhead the Cardinal's attack.
She has 15 goals, four assists and 22
ground ball pick-ups through nine
games this season. Additionally, soph
omore midfielder Meg Lentz, with 15
goals and four assists, and senior at
tacker Rachel Ozer, with 14 goals and
eight assists, will remain key cogs in
Stanford's offensive plans. Aside
from the Cardinal's established stars,
attention should be paid to freshman
attacker Kelsey Murray. She scored a
combined four goals and four assists

during victories on the road against
Cornell and Notre Dame, garnering
MPSF Rookie of the Week honors,
and could be on the verge of a break
out that could potentially propel
Stanford to the next level.
The Cardinal will look to extend
their six-match winning streak when
they face Denver on Friday. Last
year, Stanford defeated the Pioneers
7-6 to win its eighth MPSF Tourna
ment title in nine years. Denver fig
ures to be the tougher competition of
the Friday-Sunday doubleheader for
the Card. Coming off a tremendous
20-4 victory over St. Mary's last Sun
day, the Pioneers have now run their
own unbeaten streak to seven games.
Junior attacker Jill Remenapp and
senior midfielder Meredith Harris,
who have combined for 44 goals and
40 assists on the season, lead their of
fense.

Denver also has great depth, as
evidenced by the twelve different
players who contributed at least one
point in their last match. The Pio
neers figure to be a significant test
for the Cardinal, particularly for
Stanford's offense. Denver ranks
10th in the NCAA in scoring defense
this season, having allowed a paltry
75 goals in ten games. The Pioneers
have also fared better against the
teams' common opponent, Vanderbilt,
by virtue of a 10-8 victory. Stanford,
meanwhile, lost 16-15 to the Com
modores in a close overtime match
the team's only loss of the campaign
thus far. Regardless, Stanford should
be favored by virtue of its results
against tougher competition. The
Cardinal will be Denver's first top-20
opponent of the season.
On Sunday, Stanford will then face
a Colorado team playing its inaugural
season of women's lacrosse. While
the Cardinal loom as the heavy fa

vorite in this matchup, the Buffs are
coming off a convincing win 19-5
against St. Mary's. Bay Area native
Cali Castagnola, a freshman attacker
who scored four goals on four shots to
go with one assist against the Gaels,
leads the Buffs. Alongside Castagno
la, freshman midfielder Marie Moore
and freshman attacker Amelia Brown
are strong and impactful players who

will look to spur the young Buffs past
the experienced Cardinal.
Stanford faces Denver on 7 p.m.
on Friday, while Sunday's contest
against Colorado commences at 1
p.m. Pac-12 Networks will televise
both games.
