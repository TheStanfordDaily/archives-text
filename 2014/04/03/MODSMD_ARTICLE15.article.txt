The No. 10 Stanford
women's gymnastics team
(19-4, 11-3 Pac-12) will head
to Louisiana this weekend to
compete in the NCAA Baton
Rouge Regional, where it
will hope to claim its seventh
NCAA Championship berth
in the last eight seasons.
It will mark the 31st con
secutive NCAA Regional ap
pearance for the Cardinal,
who have claimed five re

2008.
Stanford will compete
against a field of five other
teams featuring No. 3 LSU,
No. 13 Auburn, No. 21 Ari

team competing in Baton

teams in the top 10 before
finishing a narrow second at
the Pac-12 Championships.
Senior Kristina Vaculik,
who led Stanford with 15 in
dividual victories on the sea

all-conference honors in the
all-around, will lead the Car-
