# W. GYMNASTICS
## NCAA Regional on tap for gymnasts 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
The No. 10 Stanford
women's gymnastics team
(19-4, 11-3 Pac-12) will head
to Louisiana this weekend to
compete in the NCAA Baton
Rouge Regional, where it
will hope to claim its seventh
NCAA Championship berth
in the last eight seasons.
It will mark the 31st con
secutive NCAA Regional ap
pearance for the Cardinal,
who have claimed five re
gional titles in their history.
Stanford has never failed to
advance to the NCAA Cham
pionships after having com
peted in the Baton Rouge
Regional with the top two
teams from each regional ad
vancing to the national meet,
Stanford finished second in
1999 and won the meet in
2008.
Stanford will compete
against a field of five other
teams featuring No. 3 LSU,
No. 13 Auburn, No. 21 Ari
zona, Kent State and lowa
State. Of those squads, the
only team that Stanford has

competed against this season
is Arizona, which the Cardi
nal defeated in a dramatic
come-from-behind win in
mid-January.
LSU will be looking to
earn its second consecutive
regional title after emerging
victorious in the Columbus
Regional last season. Led by
junior Rheagan Courville,
who is ranked second in the
country in the all-around, the
Tigers finished their regular
season with a 15-5 record
and will be the top-seeded
team at Sunday's meet.
As the only other top-10
team competing in Baton
Rouge this weekend, the
Cardinal will aim to build on
a season in which it defeated
11 top-25 teams and three
teams in the top 10 before
finishing a narrow second at
the Pac-12 Championships.
Senior Kristina Vaculik,
who led Stanford with 15 in
dividual victories on the sea
son and earned first-team
all-conference honors in the
all-around, will lead the Car-
dinal into the meet. Yaculik also
earned a third-place finish in the
bars at the Pac-12 Championships
after claiming four individual vic
tories out of the five events in a
victory over Cal in early March.
Pac-12 Freshman of the Year
Nicolette McNair will also be
looking to make a big impact for
the Cardinal after a breakout first
collegiate season in which she
earned six individual victories and
hit 94 percent of her routines on
vault, bars and beam. She has on
ly gotten stronger as the season
has progressed and will be riding
the momentum of a career-best
9.950 on bars that clinched her

second place finish in the event at
the Pac-12 Championships. She
was ultimately rewarded for her
efforts with first-team all-confer
ence selections in both the bars
and vault.
Stanford will also bring lots of
experience to the table at the
meet, with nine gymnasts that
have competed in previous region
al including senior Shona
Morgan, who will be competing in
her fourth regional lineup and
six that competed in the NCAA
Super Six in 2012, including all
conference second team selections
Amanda Spinner and Samantha
Shapiro.
The meet will take place on
Saturday starting at 2 p.m. in Ba
ton Rouge, La.
