## Project solves Wi-Fi congestion BeHop trial finds success, offers potential for broader applications 
### ALEX ZIVKOVIC DESK EDITOR 
BeHop, a Stanford research proj
ect that aims to better manage dense
Wi-Fi networks, has proven success
ful in trials in Studio 5 of Escondido
Village.
BeHop seeks to optimize network
success in high-density areas like
Stanford's campus â€”by allowing
sharing of Internet access points in
homes, colloquially called "hops." In
stead of encountering locked ac
counts, users can fluidly move be
tween access points whether they
be their own or others'.
The name of the project, accord
ing to lead researcher Yiannis Yiak
oumis M.S.'O9 Ph.D 'l4, is a combina
tion of the jazz style bebop and the
last "hop" of the network in the
home.

"If I am in my home and I'm far
away from my access point, I can use
my neighbor's access point," Yiak
oumis explained. "We're trying to re
search how we can put this together
where on one hand we can have a net
work that is very easy for the user to
set up and another that we can opti
mize infrastructure so that it is fast,
reliable, not slow and etc."
The concept for the project arose
from the challenges present in large
cities of crowded, dense networks.
"To give you some sense about
density, we did some experiments in
San Francisco and on average you get
to see around 30 home networks from
your own home," Yiakoumis said.
Yiakoumis explained that the Be-
Hop project would install an access
point in the user's apartment or stu
dio, allowing them to access the user
intuitive network as they normally
would. Those access points for the
BeHop project support higher rates
of connection than the existing equip
ment in Studio 5. In addition, the cov
erage is better for most students
since the access point is directly in
the students' room.
"I have lived in Studio 5 for four
years now and I remember that there
were periods when I had to connect
with the hardwire to get decent
streaming speed," said Alexandras
