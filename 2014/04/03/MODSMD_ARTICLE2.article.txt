## Project solves Wi-Fi congestion BeHop trial finds success, offers potential for broader applications 
### ALEX ZIVKOVIC DESK EDITOR 
BeHop, a Stanford research proj
ect that aims to better manage dense
Wi-Fi networks, has proven success
ful in trials in Studio 5 of Escondido
Village.
BeHop seeks to optimize network
success in high-density areas like
Stanford's campus â€”by allowing
sharing of Internet access points in
homes, colloquially called "hops." In
stead of encountering locked ac
counts, users can fluidly move be
tween access points whether they
be their own or others'.
The name of the project, accord
ing to lead researcher Yiannis Yiak
oumis M.S.'O9 Ph.D 'l4, is a combina
tion of the jazz style bebop and the
last "hop" of the network in the
home.

"If I am in my home and I'm far
away from my access point, I can use
my neighbor's access point," Yiak
oumis explained. "We're trying to re
search how we can put this together
where on one hand we can have a net
work that is very easy for the user to
set up and another that we can opti
mize infrastructure so that it is fast,
reliable, not slow and etc."
The concept for the project arose
from the challenges present in large
cities of crowded, dense networks.
"To give you some sense about
density, we did some experiments in
San Francisco and on average you get
to see around 30 home networks from
your own home," Yiakoumis said.
Yiakoumis explained that the Be-
Hop project would install an access
point in the user's apartment or stu
dio, allowing them to access the user
intuitive network as they normally
would. Those access points for the
BeHop project support higher rates
of connection than the existing equip
ment in Studio 5. In addition, the cov
erage is better for most students
since the access point is directly in
the students' room.
"I have lived in Studio 5 for four
years now and I remember that there
were periods when I had to connect
with the hardwire to get decent
streaming speed," said Alexandras
Manolakos M.S. 'l2 Ph.D. 'l7, a Be-
Hop user. "As far as I am con
cerned, I never had to do this af
ter I installed the new router."
"Also, they offer a free month
ly subscription to Netflix,"
Manolakos added.
In exchange for these services,
the research team receives writ
ten feedback from participating
students via a complaints form,
but more importantly collects in
formation on the network service
and data transmission.
"We are seeing up to four
times improvement in some basic
networking metrics," he added.
Yiakoumis stressed that there
is no added privacy or security
risk of BeHop given that the net
work is Stanford's and all data in
formation is anonymous.
"We do not collect any person
al information we just keep it
low-level networking metrics and
for this we're anonymizing any
sensitive information."
In addition to providing the

underlying network, IT Services
have explored the potential for a
broader rollout of the technology.
"IT Services believes this
emerging technology holds a lot of
promise for enabling innovative
solutions to current network chal
lenges and simplifying the deliv
ery and operation of the overall
network structure," wrote Nancy
Ware, director of strategic plan
ning and communication in IT
Services, in a statement. "We are
actively exploring possible uses of
this base technology and we will
continue to assess its role in the
future of Stanford's production
network."
Yiakoumis said that he has
similar goals, expressing hope
that the technology would find
broader use on campus and poten
tially in cities around the world.
"For the short term we want to
increase our user base: we want to
put more access points," Yiak
oumis said. "In the long term,
some of the ideas can be applied to
the way we set up home networks
or networks in these dense areas."
