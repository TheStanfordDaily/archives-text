# University to offer joint majors
## New initiative will combine computer science and the humanities 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
Starting next fall quarter, Stanford will offer
undergraduates the opportunity to pursue a
joint major in computer science (CS) and an
other humanities major, following the initia
tive's approval by the Faculty Senate in Febru
ary.
The initiative's pilot offerings will combine
computer science with either English or music,
though a more diverse selection may be fea
tured in the future.
The new program's structure will be distinct
from both double majors and dual degrees. Stu
dents who choose to pursue the joint major will
not be expected to complete the full require
ments of either of the two majors, but will in
stead conclude their educational experience
with "capstone" interdisciplinary courses or
projects.

According to Nicholas Jenkins, associate
professor of English and director of the CS+X
initiative—which eventually developed into
the joint major program many humanities
departments are interested in participating in
the joint major program.
"CS is becoming an integral part of many
humanities majors, and the humanities are be
coming important in CS," Jenkins said.
"There's a lot of two way traffic and we hope
that all these bridges will help transform not
only the humanities, but also the computer sci
ences. We're hoping that starting in September
this year, there will be a whole raft of CS and
humanities joint majors."
Jenkins credited the push for the joint ma
jor program to Professor of Computer Science
Eric Roberts, who advanced the idea of bring
ing together two disciplines in a fashion that
wasn't too academically rigorous to students.
"It's a wonderful thing to integrate two

fields of knowledge and find in that interstitial
between two fields a really wonderful new set
of ideas and that's exciting," Roberts said.
"Most real progress comes at the intersection."
Roberts recalled encountering significant
faculty interest last spring when he first pro
posed the idea. A Computer Science Depart
ment survey of all CS majors and students who
had taken the introductory CSIO6A class dur
ing the 2012-13 academic year, according to
Professor of Computer Science Mehran Saha
mi '92 M.S. '93 Ph.D. '99, found that 63 percent
of students would be more likely to double ma
jor were Stanford to offer a program that re
duced the number of classes required for each
major by two courses.
Roberts subsequently reached out to hu
manities departments, with the intent of en
couraging students who were originally inter-
ested in the humanities
but who for various reasons
ended up majoring in CS for
"marketability" or "practical
ity" reasons —to pursue
their passions and increasing
accessibility to larger majors
like economics which might
have been too demanding oth
erwise.
Faculty members conced
ed that the program's imple
mentation might strain the
Computer Science Depart
ment's resources.
"Making sure that the stu
dents get good advising is go
ing to be a challenge," said de
partment chair Jennifer
Widom. "Making sure that we
don't grow so fast that we get
overwhelmed is something to
worry about."
Widom explained that the
current number of under
graduates in CS has tripled
from a few years ago. Al
though students' academic in
terests have largely remained
the same over time when ma
triculating, a progressively
larger number of students
have switched to computer
science over the course of
their undergraduate career.
"[The joint major pro
gram] is one way we can ad
dress students that have CS
and another passion," Widom
said.
Widom disputed, however,
the concept that the develop
ment of a joint major pro
gram linking computer sci
ence with various humanities

subjects means that the hu
manities are dying out.
"We're not too worried
about that," Widom said. "We
realize that computing and
data is becoming more and
more important, and it's be
ing validated on the under
graduate level."
In fact, many faculty
members, including Widom,
argued that the joint major
program might help decrease
the apparent "fuzzy-techie"
divide that exists at Stanford.
"We're all at one universi
ty together. I don't know how
real [the fuzzy-techie divide]
is, but here's something holis
tic that would be a real bene
fit for the students," Jenkins
said. "I think that's impor
tant for the general mood of
the University, for people not

to feel forced to feel like they
have to be on one side of the
fence or the other."
Jenkins also asserted that
the joint major program will
be important for the broader
University, especially in
terms of developing a new
kind of intellectual culture.
"I believe that this is a
positive way to reconceptual
ize what the humanities can
do and also for other disci
plines," Jenkins said. "People
watch Stanford and they look
at what we're doing, so I
think in my opinion, we
should be the ones doing the
experimenting bringing
CS and the humanities to
gether to the next level."

"There's a lot of two way traffic and we hope
that all these bridges will help transform not
only the humanities, but also the computer sci
ences. We're hoping that starting in September
this year, there will be a whole raft of CS and
humanities joint majors."
Jenkins credited the push for the joint ma
jor program to Professor of Computer Science
Eric Roberts, who advanced the idea of bring
ing together two disciplines in a fashion that
wasn't too academically rigorous to students.
"It's a wonderful thing to integrate two

fields of knowledge and find in that interstitial
between two fields a really wonderful new set
of ideas and that's exciting," Roberts said.
"Most real progress comes at the intersection."
Roberts recalled encountering significant
faculty interest last spring when he first pro
posed the idea. A Computer Science Depart
ment survey of all CS majors and students who
had taken the introductory CSIO6A class dur
ing the 2012-13 academic year, according to
Professor of Computer Science Mehran Saha
mi '92 M.S. '93 Ph.D. '99, found that 63 percent
of students would be more likely to double ma
jor were Stanford to offer a program that re
duced the number of classes required for each
major by two courses.
Roberts subsequently reached out to hu
manities departments, with the intent of en
couraging students who were originally inter-
ested in the humanities
but who for various reasons
ended up majoring in CS for
"marketability" or "practical
ity" reasons —to pursue
their passions and increasing
accessibility to larger majors
like economics which might
have been too demanding oth
erwise.
Faculty members conced
ed that the program's imple
mentation might strain the
Computer Science Depart
ment's resources.
"Making sure that the stu
dents get good advising is go
ing to be a challenge," said de
partment chair Jennifer
Widom. "Making sure that we
don't grow so fast that we get
overwhelmed is something to
worry about."
Widom explained that the
current number of under
graduates in CS has tripled
from a few years ago. Al
though students' academic in
terests have largely remained
the same over time when ma
triculating, a progressively
larger number of students
have switched to computer
science over the course of
their undergraduate career.
"[The joint major pro
gram] is one way we can ad
dress students that have CS
and another passion," Widom
said.
Widom disputed, however,
the concept that the develop
ment of a joint major pro
gram linking computer sci
ence with various humanities

subjects means that the hu
manities are dying out.
"We're not too worried
about that," Widom said. "We
realize that computing and
data is becoming more and
more important, and it's be
ing validated on the under
graduate level."
In fact, many faculty
members, including Widom,
argued that the joint major
program might help decrease
the apparent "fuzzy-techie"
divide that exists at Stanford.
"We're all at one universi
ty together. I don't know how
real [the fuzzy-techie divide]
is, but here's something holis
tic that would be a real bene
fit for the students," Jenkins
said. "I think that's impor
tant for the general mood of
the University, for people not

to feel forced to feel like they
have to be on one side of the
fence or the other."
Jenkins also asserted that
the joint major program will
be important for the broader
University, especially in
terms of developing a new
kind of intellectual culture.
"I believe that this is a
positive way to reconceptual
ize what the humanities can
do and also for other disci
plines," Jenkins said. "People
watch Stanford and they look
at what we're doing, so I
think in my opinion, we
should be the ones doing the
experimenting bringing
CS and the humanities to
gether to the next level."

Starting next fall quarter, Stanford will offer
undergraduates the opportunity to pursue a
joint major in computer science (CS) and an
other humanities major, following the initia
tive's approval by the Faculty Senate in Febru
ary.
The initiative's pilot offerings will combine
computer science with either English or music,
though a more diverse selection may be fea
tured in the future.
The new program's structure will be distinct
from both double majors and dual degrees. Stu
dents who choose to pursue the joint major will
not be expected to complete the full require
ments of either of the two majors, but will in
stead conclude their educational experience
with "capstone" interdisciplinary courses or
projects.

According to Nicholas Jenkins, associate
professor of English and director of the CS+X
initiative—which eventually developed into
the joint major program many humanities
departments are interested in participating in
the joint major program.
"CS is becoming an integral part of many
humanities majors, and the humanities are be
coming important in CS," Jenkins said.
"There's a lot of two way traffic and we hope
that all these bridges will help transform not
only the humanities, but also the computer sci
ences. We're hoping that starting in September
