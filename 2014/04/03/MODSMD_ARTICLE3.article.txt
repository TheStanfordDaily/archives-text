# University to offer joint majors
## New initiative will combine computer science and the humanities 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
Starting next fall quarter, Stanford will offer
undergraduates the opportunity to pursue a
joint major in computer science (CS) and an
other humanities major, following the initia
tive's approval by the Faculty Senate in Febru
ary.
The initiative's pilot offerings will combine
computer science with either English or music,
though a more diverse selection may be fea
tured in the future.
The new program's structure will be distinct
from both double majors and dual degrees. Stu
dents who choose to pursue the joint major will
not be expected to complete the full require
ments of either of the two majors, but will in
stead conclude their educational experience
with "capstone" interdisciplinary courses or
projects.

According to Nicholas Jenkins, associate
professor of English and director of the CS+X
initiativeâ€”which eventually developed into
the joint major program many humanities
departments are interested in participating in
the joint major program.
"CS is becoming an integral part of many
humanities majors, and the humanities are be
coming important in CS," Jenkins said.
"There's a lot of two way traffic and we hope
that all these bridges will help transform not
only the humanities, but also the computer sci
ences. We're hoping that starting in September
this year, there will be a whole raft of CS and
humanities joint majors."
Jenkins credited the push for the joint ma
jor program to Professor of Computer Science
Eric Roberts, who advanced the idea of bring
ing together two disciplines in a fashion that
wasn't too academically rigorous to students.
"It's a wonderful thing to integrate two

fields of knowledge and find in that interstitial
between two fields a really wonderful new set
of ideas and that's exciting," Roberts said.
"Most real progress comes at the intersection."
Roberts recalled encountering significant
faculty interest last spring when he first pro
posed the idea. A Computer Science Depart
ment survey of all CS majors and students who
had taken the introductory CSIO6A class dur
ing the 2012-13 academic year, according to
Professor of Computer Science Mehran Saha
mi '92 M.S. '93 Ph.D. '99, found that 63 percent
of students would be more likely to double ma
jor were Stanford to offer a program that re
duced the number of classes required for each
major by two courses.
Roberts subsequently reached out to hu
manities departments, with the intent of en
couraging students who were originally inter-
