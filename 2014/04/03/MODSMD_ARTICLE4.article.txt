## University takes neutral stance on patent reform 
### KYLIE JUE DESK EDITOR 
Even as federal patent reform
legislation continues to spark de
bate between startups and patent
holding entities, Stanford a lead
ing source of innovation and
patents has remained neutral.
The Innovation Act passed the
House of Representatives by a vote
of 325 to 91 in December, backed by
several industry and consumer
groups. The Senate has begun to
consider a set of similar bills, which
will eventually be consolidated into
a single bill and then reconciled
with the House version.
The bills under consideration
generally seek to reduce unwar
ranted patent litigation by so-called
"patent trolls," a phenomenon that
incurred an estimated $29 billion in
cumulative damages in 2011 alone.
Why some universities oppose
reform
Jacob Sherkow, a fellow at Stan
ford Law School's Center for Law
and the Biosciences, explained that
many universities oppose change
because current laws have allowed
them to benefit in terms of both su
ing and defending. For example, in
the recent case of Carnegie Mel
lon University v. Marvell
Technology Group Ltd et al,

Marvell had to pay the university
$1.17 billion in damages.
"I think the universities are ret
icent against change," Sherkow
said. "To the extent that they feel
that their patents have been in
fringed, they have been remark
ably successful in suing."
The main aspect of the bill to
which universities have objected is
"fee shifting." The provision may
require the loser in a case to pay
the litigation costs of the other par
ty, countering the common tactic
practiced by patent trolls of forcing
defendants to settle rather than
risk losing in court while incurring
substantial legal expenses.
"There are a couple of aspects
to the bill [that universities are
against] that go in and out depend
ing on what week it is, including
joining all of the inventors [and]
making sure parties sue in their re
al name," Sherkow said.
He also explained that universi
ties are rarely sued by patent trolls
since the schools are more likely to
win in court. However, according to
Sherkow, some universities will sell
patents to patent trolls for a profit.
"There are some instances in
which universities do sell patents to
patent trolls," Sherkow said.
"Berkeley has been doing this for a
while."
"Universities also buy patents

from patent trolls and then sue," he
added. "So in that sense, universi
ties in many ways sometimes act as
their own patent trolls: they have a
patent, they don't necessarily prac
tice the technology themselves, and
they sue other people."
The discussion of whether or
not universities are patent trolls
has been ongoing for many years.
Professor of Law Mark Lemley
published a well-known paper in
2007 that concluded that universi
ties may act like patent trolls but in
fact do not typically do so.

Stanford's stance
Katherine Ku, the director of
Stanford's Office of Technology Li
censing, explained that Stanford is
neither for nor against the bill.
"We [Stanford] have opinions,
but we've not written to our con
gressmen or anything like that,"
Ku said.
In terms of Stanford's interac
tions with patent trolls, according
to Ku, the University is only inter
ested in working with companies
