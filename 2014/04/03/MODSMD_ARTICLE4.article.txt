## University takes neutral stance on patent reform 
### KYLIE JUE DESK EDITOR 
Even as federal patent reform
legislation continues to spark de
bate between startups and patent
holding entities, Stanford a lead
ing source of innovation and
patents has remained neutral.
The Innovation Act passed the
House of Representatives by a vote
of 325 to 91 in December, backed by
several industry and consumer
groups. The Senate has begun to
consider a set of similar bills, which
will eventually be consolidated into
a single bill and then reconciled
with the House version.
The bills under consideration
generally seek to reduce unwar
ranted patent litigation by so-called
"patent trolls," a phenomenon that
incurred an estimated $29 billion in
cumulative damages in 2011 alone.
Why some universities oppose
reform
Jacob Sherkow, a fellow at Stan
ford Law School's Center for Law
and the Biosciences, explained that
many universities oppose change
because current laws have allowed
them to benefit in terms of both su
ing and defending. For example, in
the recent case of Carnegie Mel
lon University v. Marvell
Technology Group Ltd et al,

Marvell had to pay the university
$1.17 billion in damages.
"I think the universities are ret
icent against change," Sherkow
said. "To the extent that they feel
that their patents have been in
fringed, they have been remark
ably successful in suing."
The main aspect of the bill to
which universities have objected is
"fee shifting." The provision may
require the loser in a case to pay
the litigation costs of the other par
ty, countering the common tactic
practiced by patent trolls of forcing
defendants to settle rather than
risk losing in court while incurring
substantial legal expenses.
"There are a couple of aspects
to the bill [that universities are
against] that go in and out depend
ing on what week it is, including
joining all of the inventors [and]
making sure parties sue in their re
al name," Sherkow said.
He also explained that universi
ties are rarely sued by patent trolls
since the schools are more likely to
win in court. However, according to
Sherkow, some universities will sell
patents to patent trolls for a profit.
"There are some instances in
which universities do sell patents to
patent trolls," Sherkow said.
"Berkeley has been doing this for a
while."
"Universities also buy patents

from patent trolls and then sue," he
added. "So in that sense, universi
ties in many ways sometimes act as
their own patent trolls: they have a
patent, they don't necessarily prac
tice the technology themselves, and
they sue other people."
The discussion of whether or
not universities are patent trolls
has been ongoing for many years.
Professor of Law Mark Lemley
published a well-known paper in
2007 that concluded that universi
ties may act like patent trolls but in
fact do not typically do so.

Stanford's stance
Katherine Ku, the director of
Stanford's Office of Technology Li
censing, explained that Stanford is
neither for nor against the bill.
"We [Stanford] have opinions,
but we've not written to our con
gressmen or anything like that,"
Ku said.
In terms of Stanford's interac
tions with patent trolls, according
to Ku, the University is only inter
ested in working with companies

that will develop actual tech
nologies.
"Certain companies have
come around and offered to
buy up patents, or they want
to have enough rights so that
they can sue others," Ku
said. "We're not really inter
ested in working with compa
nies who aren't developing
the technology themselves."
"If an entity who held a
lot of patents would come to
us and they were willing to
develop a particular technol
ogy in the area that they
have these patents and we
have an agreement that
shows that they were going
to develop it, we would con
sider licensing them," she
added.
Ku mentioned that one as
pect of the bill that Stanford
does not support is fee shift
ing.
"Let's say two big compa
nies sue each other. They're
willing to take the risk, and
they spend a lot of money,"
Ku said. "But if a university
were to sue a company and
then we lost for some reason,
it would be very expensive
for us. I think it would be a
total disincentive for univer
sities or individuals to sue."
She also expressed am
bivalence about provisions
that would require the patent
owner, not just the company
acting as the plaintiff, to be
listed in the demand letter.
"The only way we get our
technologies developed is if
we license them to someone,"
Ku said. "Many times when
there's a litigation, it's our li
censee who's suing, and we
may have to be named be
cause we're the owner of the
patent... We're okay to be
known [as] the patent holder,
but we don't want to be at the
front end of this."
In general, Ku explained
that the pressure for patent
reform stems mainly from
concerns in the high tech sec
tor.
"The drug companies, the
pharmaceutical companies,
the biotech sector [are] much
less worried about this," Ku
said.
"I do not feel that we are a
patent troll so I would love to
away to craft a legislation so

it doesn't apply to universi
ties or our kind of activities,"
she added.
The problem of patent trolls
Matt Levy, patent counsel
for the Computer and Com
munications Industry Associ
ation, explained that patent
trolls have historically been a
prominent issue for technolo
gy companies. Under current
laws, patent trolls can sue
with very little risk.
Levy also spoke about po
tential reforms that would
help prevent trolls from abus
ing the system and would en
sure that a case is reasonable.
"Patent trolls will often
send threatening letters to a
company ... saying 'We have
this patent that you might in
fringe so give us money by a
certain date,'" said Levy.
"There have been cases
where patent trolls have actu
ally sent letters with a pretty
good idea that the people they
were sending them to did not
infringe [the patent]."
Patent trolls have espe
cially had an impact on small
companies and startups. Ac
cording to Levy, some busi
nesses have had to scale back
or give up them companies all
together as a result of money
lost to patent trolls.
"Money is being drained
away to pay patent trolls in
stead of being used to make
new products or hire new
people," Levy said. "Last
year there were something
like 4800 companies sued by
patent trolls, and most of
those will settle. Of course,
that doesn't even include all
the companies that were hit
with demand letters but did
n't actually get sued."
"The technology industry
has for a long time been rais
ing concerns about patent
trolls and how they are nega
tively impacting the patent
system and the economy by
abusing the patent litigation
process," echoed Matt
Tanielian, executive director
for the Coalition for Patent
Fairness, which represents
tech companies including
Google, Cisco and Verizon.
Tanielian explained that
while the current standards
for when fee shifting would
occur are still under discus
sion, he does not believe uni
versities would be affected
since they are unlikely to file
unreasonable cases.
"If you look at the lan

guage, it seems to me that
judges have discretion when
to apply [fee shifting],"
Tanielian said. "That they
would choose to apply it
against universities... seems
a very unlikely outcome."
"There is no desire on be
half of people supporting re
form to at all damage univer
sities ability to innovate
through the legislative
process," he added. "The
goal is to deal with bad actors
and their actions, not to hurt
universities."
Where the bill will go
Sherkow explained that
the future of the bill will de
pend on what it looks if it
passes through the Senate.
"There's a question of
whether or not... the presi
dent is going to sign it or not.
The White House recently
announced it is taking its
own actions regarding patent
reform," Sherkow said. "So
to the extent that whatever
happens in the patent reform
bill conflicts with what's go
ing on at the White House,
there is a not insignificant
chance that the president
may have second thoughts
about signing it."
Sherkow also argued that
the bill will minimally affect
universities.
"For universities like
Stanford that have endow
ments that run up into the
double digit billions dollars, I
truly cannot imagine that
that's going to have any ef
fect whatsoever," Sherkow
said. "I don't even think it
will cause Stanford to think
twice about enforcing its
patent rights to the extent it
feels threatened."
The Senate Judiciary
Committee's markup is cur
rently scheduled for this
Thursday but may get
pushed back if a compromise
is not found.
"The legislative process is
a very complicated one
sometimes, and it's possible
that it could slide to next
week," Tanielian said. "But
the possibility that some
thing will be done is pretty
high. Given a legislative en
vironment where not a lot
gets accomplished, this is a
bipartisan bill that's already
passed the House that has a
fairly good chance."
