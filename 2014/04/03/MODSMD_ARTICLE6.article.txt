## New Stanford library archive features civil rights movement 
### â€“ Madeleine Han 
A new Stanford Libraries archive will fea
ture images from critical moments in recent
American history, including the civil rights
movements of the 1960s and 19705.
Approximately 200 photos from the Bob
Fitch Photography Archive are now available
online in Searchworks through Stanford Li
braries. The entire archive includes around
200,000 images.
The photos will be made available for a vari
ety of purposes. Ten thousand of the photos will
be preserved in the Stanford Digital Reposito
ry for academic purposes like research and
teaching.
A number of the photos will also be part of
an exhibition called "Movements for Change:
the Bob Fitch Photography Archive at Stan
ford." The exhibition will open in September at
Peterson Gallery of the Green Library.
Fitch, who was a photojournalist for the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference in
the 19605, captured subjects ranging from Ce
sar Chavez, co-founder of the National Farm
Workers Association, to Coretta Scott King, a
leader of the African-American Civil Rights
Movement.
Roberto Trujillo, the head of the special col
lections at Stanford Libraries and co-curator of
the archive, told the Stanford News Service
that Fitch captured Chavez's organizing efforts
over seven years.
"Some of the photographs are
intimate and offer a glimpse be
hind the headlines of their time,"
Trujillo said.
Fitch's photos of Chavez and
the United Farmworkers Union
will also expand the Stanford Li
braries' Mexican American collec
tions, which is already the largest
of its kind in the nation.
In addition to documenting the
civil rights movement, Fitch also
stood at the forefront of media cov
erage of the social tumult. Ben
jamin Lee Stone, curator of Amer
ican and British history and eo-cu
rator of the Fitch archive, told the
Stanford News Service that Fitch
documented events of the time for
African American news outlets in
high-risk situations.
Fitch's work has also left a na
tionwide legacy: one of his photos
also served as the basis for the
Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial
in Washinotnn D fl
