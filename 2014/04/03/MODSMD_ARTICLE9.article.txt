## Put my doubts to rest, Stanford women's hoops 
### Do-Hyoung Park 
After the Stanford
women's basketball
team was knocked out
of the Pac-12 Tourna
ment in the semifinals
by fifth-seeded USC, my hopes for
Stanford in the NCAA Tournament
weren't all too high. With losses to
Washington and USC, along with
several close calls down the stretch,
I wasn't confident in the Cardinal's
ability to have a consistent enough of
fense to keep up with teams having
good shooting nights —as was the
case in that loss against Washington.
As it stands, it certainly looks as if
the Cardinal took that loss to USC to
heart and used it as motivation to ride
into the NCAA Tournament with re
newed determination. When I returned
from my weeklong foray into the
wilderness over spring break, the Card
had rather easily clinched a Sweet 16
berth with victories over double-digit
seeds South Dakota and Florida State.
To welcome the student body back to
campus, the Card stymied third-seeded
Penn State to outdo its disappointing
performance in last season's tourna
ment. All seemed to be well.
But when I was in the stands during
the first half of the Stanford-UNC Elite
Eight matchup two nights ago, I must
admit that the doubts flooded back in a
big way during the first half
Absolutely nothing was going light
for the Cardinal. Chiney Ogwumike
was being closely marked on the inside,
leaving Stanford's offense without its
key cog. It led to untimely turnovers
and a stagnant offense that couldn't get
any penetration against a big North
Carolina defense. Meanwhile, on the
other side of the ball, Cardinal defend
ers were in disarray thanks to the Tar
Heels' perimeter ball movement, and

Allisha Gray was seemingly un
stoppable from behind the arc.
It was the first time I'd ever
seen Ogwumike deep into the
first half with as many points as
she had fouls. When she sat
down with two fouls with much
of the first half left to go, I was

about ready to throw in the
towel.
Amber Orrange and com
pany ensured that there would
be no towel throwing, respond
ing with 10 points, a steal and
an assist in the remainder of the
half. Lili Thompson brought the
swagger back into the house.
Mikaela Ruef fed off of the en
ergy of her last ever game at
Maples to spark the Card on
both sides of the ball. Bonnie
Samuelson resumed her sharp

shooting from 3-point range.
And in a sweeping charge,
the cavalry stormed back and
re-conquered Maples Pavilion
in one of the more impressive
comebacks I've ever seen. It
was an exclamation mark on a
point that had been evident all
season but had truly been put
to the test down the stretch:
One Chiney Ogwumike does
not a Stanford team make. Not
only did the team battle back
despite its focal point having an
uncharacteristically off day, but
it did so on the biggest of
stages.

That's why I'm confident
that this Stanford team can
give big, bad, undefeated
UConn one heck of a ride on
Sunday in Nashville.
It will go without saying
that UConn's suffocating de
fense will have the answer —
or at least, an answer—for
Ogwumike on the inside. It will
easily be the best defense that
the Card will have faced all sea
son, and as a result, it will real
ly be up to the other four on the
floor to step up and have big
days, particularly Samuelson
on the perimeter, to help Stan
ford keep pace with the
Huskies.

Coming off of the biggest
emotional high at Maples Pavil
ion this season, having cut
down the nets after the final
home win of their careers and
bouncing back from a difficult
loss to play great basketball in
the tournament, I think that
this year's group of seniors
along with the talented
younger corps—has demon
sfrated the resiliency and spirit
that it would need to pull off the
upset of the seemingly invinci
ble Huskies. UConn, like the
Cardinal, struggled a bit early
in its Elite Eight matchup be
fore pulling ahead with a big
inn. However, Stanford, unlike
many other teams in the coun
try, is capable of battling back
when faced with tough circum
stances under lots of pressure.
It's shown that time and time
again.
On paper, the game could

be seen as a mismatch. Heck,
UConn against anybody this
season could probably be seen
as a mismatch. But this is the
NCAA Tournament, when the
unexpected is to be expected
and the improbable becomes
reality I bet my friends at The
Daily that I would eat a leather
shoe if the men's team made
the Final Four, and I almost
ended up having to chow down
on tanned animal hide or, at
least, came much closer than
the nation expected.
I'm not saying that I'll eat a
pan- of rain boots if the
women's team beats UConn on
Sunday to earn a berth in the
title game, because it's not un
fathomable by any means that
it could pull off this upset. But
the numbers and the season's
results tell me that it would
take an upset of huge propor
tions for any team in the na
tion to beat the ferocious tide
that is the Connecticut
Huskies this season.
Stanford, put my doubts to
rest again.

despite its focal point having an
uncharacteristically off day, but
it did so on the biggest of
stages.

That's why I'm confident
that this Stanford team can
give big, bad, undefeated
UConn one heck of a ride on
Sunday in Nashville.
It will go without saying
that UConn's suffocating de
fense will have the answer —
or at least, an answer—for
Ogwumike on the inside. It will
easily be the best defense that
the Card will have faced all sea
son, and as a result, it will real
ly be up to the other four on the
floor to step up and have big
days, particularly Samuelson
on the perimeter, to help Stan
ford keep pace with the
Huskies.

Coming off of the biggest
emotional high at Maples Pavil
ion this season, having cut
down the nets after the final
home win of their careers and
bouncing back from a difficult
loss to play great basketball in
the tournament, I think that
this year's group of seniors
along with the talented
younger corps—has demon
sfrated the resiliency and spirit
that it would need to pull off the
upset of the seemingly invinci
ble Huskies. UConn, like the
Cardinal, struggled a bit early
in its Elite Eight matchup be
fore pulling ahead with a big
inn. However, Stanford, unlike
many other teams in the coun
try, is capable of battling back
when faced with tough circum
stances under lots of pressure.
It's shown that time and time
again.
On paper, the game could

be seen as a mismatch. Heck,
UConn against anybody this
season could probably be seen
as a mismatch. But this is the
NCAA Tournament, when the
unexpected is to be expected
and the improbable becomes
reality I bet my friends at The
Daily that I would eat a leather
shoe if the men's team made
the Final Four, and I almost
ended up having to chow down
on tanned animal hide or, at
least, came much closer than
the nation expected.
I'm not saying that I'll eat a
pan- of rain boots if the
women's team beats UConn on
Sunday to earn a berth in the
title game, because it's not un
fathomable by any means that
it could pull off this upset. But
the numbers and the season's
results tell me that it would
take an upset of huge propor
tions for any team in the na
tion to beat the ferocious tide
that is the Connecticut
Huskies this season.
Stanford, put my doubts to
rest again.

After the Stanford
women's basketball
team was knocked out
of the Pac-12 Tourna
ment in the semifinals
by fifth-seeded USC, my hopes for
Stanford in the NCAA Tournament
weren't all too high. With losses to
Washington and USC, along with
several close calls down the stretch,
I wasn't confident in the Cardinal's
ability to have a consistent enough of
fense to keep up with teams having
good shooting nights —as was the
case in that loss against Washington.
As it stands, it certainly looks as if
the Cardinal took that loss to USC to
heart and used it as motivation to ride
into the NCAA Tournament with re
newed determination. When I returned
from my weeklong foray into the
wilderness over spring break, the Card
had rather easily clinched a Sweet 16
berth with victories over double-digit
seeds South Dakota and Florida State.
To welcome the student body back to
campus, the Card stymied third-seeded
Penn State to outdo its disappointing
performance in last season's tourna
ment. All seemed to be well.
But when I was in the stands during
the first half of the Stanford-UNC Elite
Eight matchup two nights ago, I must
admit that the doubts flooded back in a
big way during the first half
Absolutely nothing was going light
for the Cardinal. Chiney Ogwumike
was being closely marked on the inside,
leaving Stanford's offense without its
key cog. It led to untimely turnovers
and a stagnant offense that couldn't get
any penetration against a big North
Carolina defense. Meanwhile, on the
other side of the ball, Cardinal defend
ers were in disarray thanks to the Tar
Heels' perimeter ball movement, and

Allisha Gray was seemingly un
stoppable from behind the arc.
It was the first time I'd ever
seen Ogwumike deep into the
first half with as many points as
she had fouls. When she sat
down with two fouls with much
of the first half left to go, I was

about ready to throw in the
towel.
Amber Orrange and com
pany ensured that there would
be no towel throwing, respond
ing with 10 points, a steal and
an assist in the remainder of the
half. Lili Thompson brought the
swagger back into the house.
Mikaela Ruef fed off of the en
ergy of her last ever game at
Maples to spark the Card on
both sides of the ball. Bonnie
Samuelson resumed her sharp

shooting from 3-point range.
And in a sweeping charge,
the cavalry stormed back and
re-conquered Maples Pavilion
in one of the more impressive
comebacks I've ever seen. It
was an exclamation mark on a
point that had been evident all
season but had truly been put
to the test down the stretch:
One Chiney Ogwumike does
not a Stanford team make. Not
only did the team battle back
despite its focal point having an
uncharacteristically off day, but
it did so on the biggest of
