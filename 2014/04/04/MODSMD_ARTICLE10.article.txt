# Crashing Corvallis
## Card takes first trip in a month to face Beavers 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN DESK EDITOR 
Another weekend series, another tough
matchup for the Stanford baseball squad
(10-11,3-3 Pac-12) as it hits the road for the
first time since a March 4 showdown with
Cal.

The mighty No. 6 Oregon State Beavers
(22-6, 6-2 Pac-12) await in Corvallis, Ore.,
but the Cardinal bring with them a new
found confidence after earning their first se
ries win over a ranked opponent last week
against No. 11 Oregon.

A lot of attention has been given to
Stanford's youth movement on the mound
this season, but it was a pair of first-year bats
that helped the Card break through against
the Ducks. Freshman second baseman Tom
my Edman provided the walk-off sacrifice fly
to lift Stanford to a 2-1 victory in extra in
nings in the second game of the series.
Meanwhile, freshman designated hitter
Alex Dunlap extended his hitting streak to
eight games, adding to his team-leading .360
batting average.
The Cardinal will almost certainly need
more timely hitting out of their freshmen,
along with steady play from veterans Alex
Blandino, Danny Diekroeger, Brett Michael
Doran and Austin Slater, who are all batting
over .300. On the season, Stanford is 8-0
when scoring over three runs, but holds a

meager 2-11 record when failing to meet
that mark.

Consistent offensive production will be
a major key for the Cardinal as they look to
support their starting pitching, which has
continued to shine in recent weeks. The
freshman trio of Brett Hanewich, Cal
Quantrill and Chris Viall will start the three
games â€”in that order against the
Beavers.

Hanewich (1-1), whose 2.05 ERA is the
best among Stanford's starters, finally picked
up his first win last Friday against Oregon.
Quantrill (3-2) shined in the second game of
the series as he gave up 1 run over 7 innings
of work before handing the ball over to lefty
John Hochstatter, who picked up the win.

Freshman Tommy Edman (above) won the Cardinal's 10-inning game against Oregon with a sacrifice fly last Friday. Stanford needs
Edman and fellow freshman Alex Dunlap to keep producing runs if it wants to escape its trip to No. 6 Oregon State with a series win.
