## SOFTBALL Stanford back to desert No. 10 Arizona stands in way of resurgent Card 
### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After picking up a much-needed victory
and confidence booster against Pacific, No. 24
Stanford softball (24-11, 1-5 Pac-12) returns
this weekend to the Arizona desert, where
the Cardinal will look to pick up some mar
quee victories against No. 10 Arizona (29-8,4-
5) in their quest for an NCAA postseason
berth.

Stanford ended a five-game losing streak
by shutting out the Tigers 8-0 in Stockton,
Calif., last Friday, sweeping the season series
against its Northern California rival. Now, the
Cardinal will try to end their Pac-12 slide
against the Wildcats in Tucson, Ariz., in Stan
ford's second trip to the state of Arizona in the
last three weekends.

With the Card's last trip to the state of
Arizona which ended in a series sweep at
the hands of No. 7 Arizona State fresh on
the minds of many around the program, Stan
ford could really use a good performance
against the Wildcats not only to make up
ground in the Pac-12 standings, but also to
add to its postseason resume. The Cardinal
currently boast an RPI of 42, with its best vic
tory to date coming against Northwestern
(RPI of 24) in the Kajikawa Classic.
Thus, any wins over Arizona —with its
top-10 RPI —would provide a tremen
dous boost to the Card's profile.
The Wildcats enter this weekend's
series having also suffered a setback to
ASU; Arizona lost two of three to its
Territorial Cup rival in Tempe, Ariz, last
weekend.
However, while Arizona has only
managed a 4-5 record in road contests,
the Wildcats have been unbeatable
within the friendly confines of Hillen
brand Stadium, notching a perfect
record of 19-0 when playing in Tucson
this season. Most recently at home, Ari
zona blasted Oregon State in three
straight contests by a combined score
of 36-2, triggering the mercy rule in
each game. Therefore, the Cardinal will
certainly have their hands full against a
formidable Pac-12 opponent in what
figures to be a raucous atmosphere at
Hillenbrand Stadium.
Arizona is led on offense by senior
Kellie Fox, who is hitting .416 in 101 at

bats with 12 home runs and 45 RBIs on
the season. The UCLA transfer has
shined in her first season of competi
tion on the Wildcats' roster, leading her
team in slugging percentage with an
.861 mark. The Wildcats' lineup is also
paced by junior Hallie Wilson, as the
Santa Ana, Calif, native has batted .404
with 35 RBIs and 8 doubles in 37 starts.
Wilson's patient approach at the plate
has also allowed her to post a team-lead
ing 31 walks and an outstanding .543
on-base percentage.
In the circle, the Wildcats have re
lied on a rotation of five pitchers over
the course of the season. All five Ari
zona pitchers have made at least five
starts on the season, with senior Estela
Pinon leading the staff in starts and vic
tories. Pinon, a hometown product and
former junior college transfer, has post
ed a 1.51 ERA with 76 strikeouts in 79
innings of work.
In addition, sophomore Nancy
Bowling has also had a strong season for
the Wildcats. The 2013 Pac-12 All-
Freshman Honorable Mention selec
tion has not lost in the circle in 2014,
with a perfect 6-0 record in 15 total ap
pearances. Bowling has yielded 9
earned runs and 4 extra-base hits in her

sophomore campaign.
Fifth-year senior Kenzie Fowler,
who has persevered this year following
season-ending back surgery in 2013, is
a two-time NFCA All-American who at
tended the same high school as the Car
dinal's star player, Kayla Bonstrom.
As a freshman, Fowler posted one
of the finest seasons in Arizona pro
gram history, notching an incredible
38-9 record with a 1.53 ERA in a NFCA
First Team All-America campaign. Fur
thermore, as a sophomore, the Tucson
native was again recognized as an NF
CA All-American, as Fowler posted a
26-9 mark with 243 strikeouts in 213.1
innings of work. This season, Fowler
has a 5-3 record and a 2.01 ERA in 7
starts and 17 appearances. Fowler has
also only allowed 23 hits in 52.1 in
nings, compiling 49 strikeouts in the
process.
Stanford and Arizona will play on
Friday, Saturday and Sunday at Hillen
brand Stadium. Friday's and Saturday's
contests will both start at 6 p.m., while
a Sunday matinee at noon will round
out the series between the two schools.
