## SOFTBALL Stanford back to desert No. 10 Arizona stands in way of resurgent Card 
### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After picking up a much-needed victory
and confidence booster against Pacific, No. 24
Stanford softball (24-11, 1-5 Pac-12) returns
this weekend to the Arizona desert, where
the Cardinal will look to pick up some mar
quee victories against No. 10 Arizona (29-8,4-
5) in their quest for an NCAA postseason
berth.

Stanford ended a five-game losing streak
by shutting out the Tigers 8-0 in Stockton,
Calif., last Friday, sweeping the season series
against its Northern California rival. Now, the
Cardinal will try to end their Pac-12 slide
against the Wildcats in Tucson, Ariz., in Stan
ford's second trip to the state of Arizona in the
last three weekends.

With the Card's last trip to the state of
Arizona which ended in a series sweep at
the hands of No. 7 Arizona State fresh on
the minds of many around the program, Stan
ford could really use a good performance
against the Wildcats not only to make up
ground in the Pac-12 standings, but also to
add to its postseason resume. The Cardinal
currently boast an RPI of 42, with its best vic
tory to date coming against Northwestern
