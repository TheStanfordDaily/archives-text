# HARDBALL #2 STANFORD VS. #1 CONNECTICUT
## RIVALS MEET AGAIN IN FINAL FOUR 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
The wheels have barely left the tarmac of San Jose In
ternational Airport when Stanford women's basket
ball head coach Tara VanDerveer and her assistant
coaches take their iPads out to watch film, preparing
for the No. 2 seed Cardinal's (33-3) Final Four
matchup with No. 1 Connecticut (38-0) before even arriving in
Nashville, Tenn.
Soon, Ail-American senior forward Chiney Ogwumike
comes to the front of the plane, where she ends up spending
most of the flight going over film and scouting the Huskies with
associate coach Amy Tucker.
Stanford is known to be a scouting team that does its
homework on its opponents. Upon landing in the Music City,
the players barely had enough time to put down their bags at
the hotel before they had a quick dinner and dug into even
more film. It was VanDerveer's scouting of Florida State in the
round of 32 that prompted her to make the crucial defensive
switch to zone, allowing the Cardinal to overcome an early
eight-point deficit.
Defensive strategy was also key for the Cardinal in shutting
down North Carolina on Tuesday, as they limited the Tar Heels
to just 1 l-of-29 shooting in the second half, securing their lead
in the final minutes and also securing a Final Four spot on their
home court.

"At the beginning of the year, when the regional sites came
out and I saw there was one at Stanford, I was determined to
play here [at Maples], to win here, to go to the Final Four," said
redshirt senior Mikaela Ruef, who won the Stanford Regional
Most Outstanding Player Award. "This was our goal all year, to
win [at home] and go to the Final Four. We have higher goals,
but to be able to do it in front of our home crowd [was spe
cial]."

All the attention for the next two days will be focused on
defeating the top overall seed Huskies and achieving that "high
er goal" of the NCAA championship that has remained elusive
to VanDerveer since 1992. This is the Cardinal's sixth appear
ance in the Final Four in seven years, as they fell short in the
Sweet 16 last season.

"I'm so proud of how we battled [against UNC], You know,
we didn't go anywhere last year, and we had some kind of dips

in the road this year that I think really have helped us be who
we are," VanDerveer said. "We'll be ready. We're excited.
We're looking forward to playing Connecticut. We're looking
forward to going to Nashville."
The Huskies are attempting to top off a perfect season
with a repeat NCAA title, led by a trio of Ail-Americans. Soph
omore national player of the year contender Breanna Stewart,
a 6-foot-4 forward, leads the team in scoring with 19.4 points
and 8.1 rebounds per game. Seniors Stephanie Dolson (12.4
points and 9.2 rebounds per game) and Bria Hartley (16.3
points and 3.6 rebounds per game) bring leadership, experi
ence and acute contributions to the post and perimeter, respec
tively.

Huskies coach Geno Auriemma, who is in his 28th year at
the helm of the team, refuses to settle for a win against the
Card and instead is setting his sights on the program's ninth na
tional title. The Huskies have an imposing presence on the low
block, with similar size to what Stanford had to contend with
against Penn State. All of the scouting and film-watching will
come in handy when deciding how to contain Connecticut's
post presence and 50 percent shooting at least, if Stanford
wants to silence the naysayers who have claimed from the start
of the season that a Notre Dame-Connecticut matchup in the
finals was inevitable.

"If they just wanted a Connecticut-Notre Dame show
down, what did they make us do this for?" VanDerveer said. "If
they wanted from the selection show just to have these two
teams show up in Nashville, then where's the excitement? I
think everyone last year thought Baylor was going to win. Ob
viously, they didn't."
Stanford freshman guard Lili Thompson did an excellent
job of shutting down her opponents' leading scorers in both
tournament wins at Maples, and even knocked down two of
the Cardinal's final three shots to secure the win against UNC.
The Cardinal were also led by a career-high night in scoring
from Ruef, who finished with 17 points and went 3-for-5 from
behind the arc. Junior point guard Amber Orrange and junior
guard Bonnie Samuelson also scored in double digits, comple
menting the 20-point performance from Ogwumike, and mak
ing key contributions in the opening half when Ogwumike was
held to just 4 points.
The Cardinal fell to the
Huskies in the second game of the
regular season 76-57. However,
with the whole Stanford roster
healthy and with five players scor
ing in double digits last game, any
thing is possible for this Cardinal
team when they play with "heart,"
as Ogwumike always emphasizes.
"The fact that we've played
them already helps us," Van-
Derveer said. "Everyone will un

derstand this is what we need to
do. They're a very big team.
They're a very talented team. But
our team will be very focused, and
the fact that we've played them has
played to our advantage."
"We're looking forward to it,"
she added, "and our coaches and
team will work really hard to play
better than we did last time at Con
necticut in the opening game. I
think we're much improved."
Sunday's game begins at 6
p.m. and will be televised on ESPN.

we didn't go anywhere last year, and we had some kind of dips

in the road this year that I think really have helped us be who
we are," VanDerveer said. "We'll be ready. We're excited.
We're looking forward to playing Connecticut. We're looking
forward to going to Nashville."
The Huskies are attempting to top off a perfect season
with a repeat NCAA title, led by a trio of Ail-Americans. Soph
omore national player of the year contender Breanna Stewart,
a 6-foot-4 forward, leads the team in scoring with 19.4 points
and 8.1 rebounds per game. Seniors Stephanie Dolson (12.4
points and 9.2 rebounds per game) and Bria Hartley (16.3
points and 3.6 rebounds per game) bring leadership, experi
ence and acute contributions to the post and perimeter, respec
tively.

Huskies coach Geno Auriemma, who is in his 28th year at
the helm of the team, refuses to settle for a win against the
Card and instead is setting his sights on the program's ninth na
tional title. The Huskies have an imposing presence on the low
block, with similar size to what Stanford had to contend with
against Penn State. All of the scouting and film-watching will
come in handy when deciding how to contain Connecticut's
post presence and 50 percent shooting at least, if Stanford
wants to silence the naysayers who have claimed from the start
of the season that a Notre Dame-Connecticut matchup in the
finals was inevitable.

"If they just wanted a Connecticut-Notre Dame show
down, what did they make us do this for?" VanDerveer said. "If
they wanted from the selection show just to have these two
teams show up in Nashville, then where's the excitement? I
think everyone last year thought Baylor was going to win. Ob
viously, they didn't."
Stanford freshman guard Lili Thompson did an excellent
job of shutting down her opponents' leading scorers in both
tournament wins at Maples, and even knocked down two of
the Cardinal's final three shots to secure the win against UNC.
The Cardinal were also led by a career-high night in scoring
from Ruef, who finished with 17 points and went 3-for-5 from
behind the arc. Junior point guard Amber Orrange and junior
guard Bonnie Samuelson also scored in double digits, comple
menting the 20-point performance from Ogwumike, and mak
ing key contributions in the opening half when Ogwumike was
held to just 4 points.
The Cardinal fell to the
Huskies in the second game of the
regular season 76-57. However,
with the whole Stanford roster
healthy and with five players scor
ing in double digits last game, any
thing is possible for this Cardinal
team when they play with "heart,"
as Ogwumike always emphasizes.
"The fact that we've played
them already helps us," Van-
Derveer said. "Everyone will un

derstand this is what we need to
do. They're a very big team.
They're a very talented team. But
our team will be very focused, and
the fact that we've played them has
played to our advantage."
"We're looking forward to it,"
she added, "and our coaches and
team will work really hard to play
better than we did last time at Con
necticut in the opening game. I
think we're much improved."
Sunday's game begins at 6
p.m. and will be televised on ESPN.

Fifth-year senior forward Mikaela Ruef (right) was named the Stanford
Regional Most Outstanding Player for her role in spurring the Cardinal's
Final Four run, including 3-for-5 shooting from 3-point range against UNC.
The wheels have barely left the tarmac of San Jose In
ternational Airport when Stanford women's basket
ball head coach Tara VanDerveer and her assistant
coaches take their iPads out to watch film, preparing
for the No. 2 seed Cardinal's (33-3) Final Four
matchup with No. 1 Connecticut (38-0) before even arriving in
Nashville, Tenn.
Soon, Ail-American senior forward Chiney Ogwumike
comes to the front of the plane, where she ends up spending
most of the flight going over film and scouting the Huskies with
associate coach Amy Tucker.
Stanford is known to be a scouting team that does its
homework on its opponents. Upon landing in the Music City,
the players barely had enough time to put down their bags at
the hotel before they had a quick dinner and dug into even
more film. It was VanDerveer's scouting of Florida State in the
round of 32 that prompted her to make the crucial defensive
switch to zone, allowing the Cardinal to overcome an early
eight-point deficit.
Defensive strategy was also key for the Cardinal in shutting
down North Carolina on Tuesday, as they limited the Tar Heels
to just 1 l-of-29 shooting in the second half, securing their lead
in the final minutes and also securing a Final Four spot on their
home court.

"At the beginning of the year, when the regional sites came
out and I saw there was one at Stanford, I was determined to
play here [at Maples], to win here, to go to the Final Four," said
redshirt senior Mikaela Ruef, who won the Stanford Regional
Most Outstanding Player Award. "This was our goal all year, to
win [at home] and go to the Final Four. We have higher goals,
but to be able to do it in front of our home crowd [was spe
cial]."

All the attention for the next two days will be focused on
defeating the top overall seed Huskies and achieving that "high
er goal" of the NCAA championship that has remained elusive
to VanDerveer since 1992. This is the Cardinal's sixth appear
ance in the Final Four in seven years, as they fell short in the
Sweet 16 last season.

"I'm so proud of how we battled [against UNC], You know,
we didn't go anywhere last year, and we had some kind of dips
