# Characters fuel Final Four run
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
Football season is long gone, Stanford men's
basketball's magic run is over and the NHL
playoffs don't start until mid-April, but
none of that stopped me from losing my
voice earlier this week.
Up in one of the dark corners of Maples Pavil
ion I swayed, belting every word of "Hail, Stanford,

Hail" so loudly that sports
editor Do-Hyoung Park
and editor in chief George
Chen had trouble contain
ing their laughter, as the
Cardinal women's basket
ball team celebrated its
Elite Eight victory over

North Carolina on Tuesday
night. Passover doesn't start for 10 more days, but
I've definitely had my religious experience for the
month.
For some background, I watched the men's
team cut down those Maples nets four times in six
years while I was growing up. "That's just what we
do around here," I figured at the time. The last
decade has proven me, we 11... wrong.
But in those 10 years, the very same nets have
kept coming down, season after season, at the
hands of that other basketball team that calls
Maples its home.
And after I personally witnessed that emotion
packed ceremony for the first time since 2004 on
Tuesday, Stanford women's basketball became a
part of me, even if it wasn't a big part of my child
hood. Meeting each year's team for the first time
in the Final Four, as I used to, just doesn't do the
Cardinal justice.
Speaking of the Final Four, we've got a game
to watch this Sunday.
Yesterday, Do analyzed some of the basketball
reasons that Stanford could make its trip to
Nashville special. I agree wholeheartedly, but what
stand out to me the most aren't stats or matchups;
they're characters.
There's the grizzly Tara VanDerveer, the Nai
smith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame coach who
dumped her stern sideline demeanor for an enthu
siastic fist pump late in Tuesday's emotional win.
Tara's last NCAA championship came 22 years ago,

and since then, she's seen the likes of
Wiggins, Appel, Pedersen, Pohlen and
one Ogwumike leave Stanford without
reaching that final pinnacle. Chances
are, she's motivated to prevent the
same from happening to Ogwumike
number two.

There's the fiery Mikaela Ruef,
who somehow balances a 5-to-9
schedule of work, school and basket
ball and still manages (even with the
nickname "Ruefie") to be the least
sleepy player on the court game in and
game out. As Stanford struggled to bat
tle back against the Tar Heels, the 6-
foot-3 Ruef couldn't have picked a bet
ter time to knock down the seventh,
eighth and ninth 3-pointers of her five
year career. Ruef may have had trouble
putting her emotions into words after
the win, but it's clear what she means
to this team; Ruef may spend her days
working on the pipelines around cam
pus, but she spends her nights making
the Cardinal's pipe dream a reality.
And, of course, there's Chiney
Ogwumike, the founder and president
of Nerd Nation sorry, Mr. Hen
nessy whose charisma hasn't
waned since she stepped onto the
Farm. I'll admit, the Bookstore's loop
ing of "N-E-R-D-S" feels a bit repetitive
after several textbook trips this week.

Yet the video captures so much of
what makes Chiney arguably the Uni
versity's best representative, somehow
encapsulating both the classic Stanford
image of an Andrew Luck and the
more vocal personality of a Richard
Sherman. And as North Carolina
learned on Tuesday, Chiney can be
(temporarily) defeated, but she cannot
be destroyed.

Many people including one re
cent Daily sports editor believe that
everything in sports can be broken in
to some stat, explained by some num
ber. Maybe that's true. As a fan, how
ever, I've always found the characters
way more compelling, and whether or
not you think the Cardinal's unique
cast will itself be enough to upset
UConn on Sunday, you have to ac
knowledge how special this group is.

Stanford women's basketball has
been dominant for far too long to not
have earned that third national title.
They're the new, "that's just what we
do around here," and this is the year
they get it done.

Joseph Bey da's emotional rendition of
"Hail, Stanford, Hail" showed The Dai
ly's staff that there is, in fact, some
body on campus that knows every
word of the school's hymn. Little did he
know that a hidden camera was cap
turing his deep fervor. Give Joey your
support as The Daily aims to make him
a You Tube sensation at jbeyda@stan
ford.edu.

the win, but it's clear what she means
to this team; Ruef may spend her days
working on the pipelines around cam
pus, but she spends her nights making
the Cardinal's pipe dream a reality.
And, of course, there's Chiney
Ogwumike, the founder and president
of Nerd Nation sorry, Mr. Hen
nessy whose charisma hasn't
waned since she stepped onto the
Farm. I'll admit, the Bookstore's loop
ing of "N-E-R-D-S" feels a bit repetitive
after several textbook trips this week.

Yet the video captures so much of
what makes Chiney arguably the Uni
versity's best representative, somehow
encapsulating both the classic Stanford
image of an Andrew Luck and the
more vocal personality of a Richard
Sherman. And as North Carolina
learned on Tuesday, Chiney can be
(temporarily) defeated, but she cannot
be destroyed.

Many people including one re
cent Daily sports editor believe that
everything in sports can be broken in
to some stat, explained by some num
ber. Maybe that's true. As a fan, how
ever, I've always found the characters
way more compelling, and whether or
not you think the Cardinal's unique
cast will itself be enough to upset
UConn on Sunday, you have to ac
knowledge how special this group is.

Stanford women's basketball has
been dominant for far too long to not
have earned that third national title.
They're the new, "that's just what we
do around here," and this is the year
they get it done.

Joseph Bey da's emotional rendition of
"Hail, Stanford, Hail" showed The Dai
ly's staff that there is, in fact, some
body on campus that knows every
word of the school's hymn. Little did he
know that a hidden camera was cap
turing his deep fervor. Give Joey your

Football season is long gone, Stanford men's
basketball's magic run is over and the NHL
playoffs don't start until mid-April, but
none of that stopped me from losing my
voice earlier this week.
Up in one of the dark corners of Maples Pavil
ion I swayed, belting every word of "Hail, Stanford,

Hail" so loudly that sports
editor Do-Hyoung Park
and editor in chief George
Chen had trouble contain
ing their laughter, as the
Cardinal women's basket
ball team celebrated its
Elite Eight victory over

North Carolina on Tuesday
night. Passover doesn't start for 10 more days, but
I've definitely had my religious experience for the
month.
For some background, I watched the men's
team cut down those Maples nets four times in six
years while I was growing up. "That's just what we
do around here," I figured at the time. The last
decade has proven me, we 11... wrong.
But in those 10 years, the very same nets have
kept coming down, season after season, at the
hands of that other basketball team that calls
Maples its home.
And after I personally witnessed that emotion
packed ceremony for the first time since 2004 on
Tuesday, Stanford women's basketball became a
part of me, even if it wasn't a big part of my child
hood. Meeting each year's team for the first time
in the Final Four, as I used to, just doesn't do the
Cardinal justice.
Speaking of the Final Four, we've got a game
to watch this Sunday.
Yesterday, Do analyzed some of the basketball
reasons that Stanford could make its trip to
Nashville special. I agree wholeheartedly, but what
stand out to me the most aren't stats or matchups;
they're characters.
There's the grizzly Tara VanDerveer, the Nai
smith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame coach who
dumped her stern sideline demeanor for an enthu
siastic fist pump late in Tuesday's emotional win.
Tara's last NCAA championship came 22 years ago,

and since then, she's seen the likes of
Wiggins, Appel, Pedersen, Pohlen and
one Ogwumike leave Stanford without
reaching that final pinnacle. Chances
are, she's motivated to prevent the
same from happening to Ogwumike
number two.

There's the fiery Mikaela Ruef,
who somehow balances a 5-to-9
schedule of work, school and basket
ball and still manages (even with the
nickname "Ruefie") to be the least
sleepy player on the court game in and
game out. As Stanford struggled to bat
tle back against the Tar Heels, the 6-
foot-3 Ruef couldn't have picked a bet
ter time to knock down the seventh,
eighth and ninth 3-pointers of her five
year career. Ruef may have had trouble
putting her emotions into words after
the win, but it's clear what she means
to this team; Ruef may spend her days
working on the pipelines around cam
pus, but she spends her nights making
the Cardinal's pipe dream a reality.
And, of course, there's Chiney
Ogwumike, the founder and president
of Nerd Nation sorry, Mr. Hen
nessy whose charisma hasn't
waned since she stepped onto the
