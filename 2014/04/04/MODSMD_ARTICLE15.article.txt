# Characters fuel Final Four run

### Joseph Beyda 
Football season is long gone, Stanford men's
basketball's magic run is over and the NHL
playoffs don't start until mid-April, but
none of that stopped me from losing my
voice earlier this week.
Up in one of the dark corners of Maples Pavil
ion I swayed, belting every word of "Hail, Stanford,

Hail" so loudly that sports
editor Do-Hyoung Park
and editor in chief George
Chen had trouble contain

Cardinal women's basket
ball team celebrated its
Elite Eight victory over

North Carolina on Tuesday

I've definitely had my religious experience for the

For some background, I watched the men's
team cut down those Maples nets four times in six
years while I was growing up. "That's just what we
do around here," I figured at the time. The last
decade has proven me, we 11... wrong.
But in those 10 years, the very same nets have
kept coming down, season after season, at the
hands of that other basketball team that calls
Maples its home.
And after I personally witnessed that emotion
packed ceremony for the first time since 2004 on
Tuesday, Stanford women's basketball became a
part of me, even if it wasn't a big part of my child
hood. Meeting each year's team for the first time
in the Final Four, as I used to, just doesn't do the
Cardinal justice.
Speaking of the Final Four, we've got a game
to watch this Sunday.
Yesterday, Do analyzed some of the basketball
reasons that Stanford could make its trip to
Nashville special. I agree wholeheartedly, but what
stand out to me the most aren't stats or matchups;
they're characters.
There's the grizzly Tara VanDerveer, the Nai
smith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame coach who
dumped her stern sideline demeanor for an enthu
siastic fist pump late in Tuesday's emotional win.
Tara's last NCAA championship came 22 years ago,
