# Tennis teams take on SoCal rivals

### FIONA NOONAN STAFF WRITER 
In a jam-packed weekend for Stanford
tennis, both the men's and women's teams
will face their toughest Pac-12 competition
yet as they square off against USC and
UCLA this Friday and Saturday.
The No. 52 men's squad (9-2, 2-0 Pac
-12) is coming off of a six-match winning
streak (the team's longest since 2011) going
into Friday's match at No. 2 USC (20-2, 2-0
Pac-12), which will be the Cardinal's high
est-ranked opponent of the season.
The Trojans have lost just twice in 22
matches this season behind strong play from
No. 3 singles player Ray Sarmiento and four
others ranked in the top 100 nationally.

Stanford has had great success on the road
this season and will carry a 4-1 away record
to Marks Stadium, but it will need its best
match play of the season to defeat USC.
On Saturday, the men face No. 3 UCLA
(15-2, 2-0) in Los Angeles, which should be
an equally tough match. The teams last met
on Feb. 9 on the Farm, but the match was
suspended at 1-1 due to rain.
The Bruins are coming off a pair of road
wins against Washington and Oregon, and
will have faced No. 18 Cal on Friday before
taking on Stanford. The Cardinal have a tall
order to fill, but should be able to ride re
cent momentum and solid play from junior
John Morrissey and No. 55 sophomore Ma
ciek Romanowicz.
The women's weekend will be no less

daunting, as the No. 4 Cardinal (13-0, 5-0)
face two other teams unbeaten in Pac-12
play in No 3. UCLA (17-1, 5-0) and No. 13
USC (14-4, 5-0) atTaube Family Tennis Cen
ter.

Stanford begins on Friday with UCLA,
whose only loss this season came at the
hands of No. 1 Duke back in February. The
Bruins have blanked their last five oppo
nents and, like Stanford, have not dropped a
single doubles point this season behind the
No. 1 and No. 5-ranked doubles pairs in the
country.

It should be an intense showdown in
both doubles and singles, with Stanford's
No. 10 duo of senior Kristie Ahn and fresh-

Freshman Carol Zhao (above) has fit in just fine alongside senior Kristie Ahn on the Cardinal's top doubles team, which has risen to No.
10 in the country. She'll need to be at her best this weekend as the women's team faces No. 3 UCLA and No. 13 USC at home.
