# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Streak stretches to eight Stanford handles Pacific in Tigers' last trip to Maples 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's volleyball (17-1) hosted Pacific
on Thursday night in the Tigers' final match at
Maples Pavilion, as Pacific recently announced that
this will be its final season in the sport. The Cardi
nal marked the historic night by sweeping Pacific
25-17, 25-18, 25-21, to win their eighth match in
a row. Stanford is continuing to dominate its oppo
nents with aggressive offense and is looking confi
dent and strong heading into the final three match
es of the season.

While the first set started off close and was
tied at 8-8, the Cardinal quickly took control of the
points and pulled ahead. Stanford won the first set
25-17, going on a six-point run to close out the set.
Stanford hit an impressive .385 and senior out
side hitter Steven Irvin had 4 kills in the set. While
the second set also started off slowly for Stanford
and was once again tied at 8-8, an impressive block
ing performance by the Cardinal gave Stanford the
advantage. Pacific started to struggle and Stanford
began to capitalize off Pacific's unsteady offense,
winning the set easily.

Pacific rallied back in the third set to gain a
lead at 15-13, but ultimately Stanford's offense
proved too strong to withhold and the Cardinal re
took the lead. Pacific made a critical attack error
late in the match, putting the Cardinal up 20-19. In
the end, Stanford won the match in three sets.
Stanford will play California Baptist in its final
home match of the season tomorrow night. The
Cardinal will celebrate their seniors, who will play
for the last time in the incredible home environ
ment that Maples provides.

The current seniors have been critical to the
team's success in the second half of the season by
providing leadership and the ability to keep fighting
after starting the season 9-7. California Baptist
heads into the match 4-20 overall and only 2-18 in
conference. It has not won since the beginning of
March, losing its last eight matches to mirror the

Cardinal's own eight-match winning streak. As a
team, the Lancers hit .278 and their offense is led
by junior outside hitter Johannes Brink, who aver
ages 4.05 kills per set.

Stanford's Senior Night will begin at 7 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion.
