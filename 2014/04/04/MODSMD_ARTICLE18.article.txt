## SPRING FORWARD Cardinal Ballet presents their spring show 
### SOPHIA DAO 
Cardinal Ballet's annual spring show, Cardinal
Dance Fusion, will enliven Dinkelspiel Audito
rium this Thursday and Saturday, in a pair of
events that will feature performances blend
ing classical and contemporary cultures.

Classically trained members of Cardinal Ballet
will bring selections from La Bayadere and Swan
Lake to life by introducing a contemporary piece ti
tled Seed by renowned San Francisco-based choreog
rapher and current Intro Ballet lecturer Erik Wagner.

Cardinal Dance Fusion will meanwhile showcase
work by Stanford students. After After by Julia Nei
dert 'l3 M.S. 'l4 was created using statistical model
ing to generate new choreography based on the
works of classical choreographer Marius Petipa and
contemporary choreographer Alonzo King. Neidert's
production promises to pique your imagination.
Additionally, expect to feel Dinkelspiel energized
with a cheery performance set to "Time of My Life,"

a dance to music from Tangled, and an original piece
on pointe. The vast array of pieces presented by Car
dinal Ballet aims to show the full range of talent and
ability of the diverse student group while allowing
dancers to expand their range and technique through
assorted dances and forms.

As a worldwide language of its own, ballet en
dures through globally consistent performance and
movement vocabulary with slight variations from cul
ture to culture. Company director Caroline Grueskin
'l4 said that she had found ballet classes fascinating
during her travels to Germany, noting that "structure
remained the same across cultures and was very easy
to follow along, once you had a grasp of the tech
nique."

Grueskin added that within classical ballet's "ex
tremely precise technique, which sounds to most
people completely stifling," she found "extraordinary
freedom as you begin to master it." This freedom at
tained through perfecting classical ballet technique

"Perfecting classical ballet
technique
allows dancers to transcend
boundaries"

allows dancers to transcend boundaries of
language and time to impart the longstanding
lessons and stories of classical ballet and to
celebrate the mysteries and joys of contem
porary ballet. Furthermore, classical ballet
technique acts as the springboard from
which many dance forms have launched.
If you make it to Dinkelspiel this week,
allow the energy of the performances to fuel
your spring quarter as you momentarily find
yourself immersed in an exquisite world of
dance fashioned by Cardinal Ballet, Urban
Styles, Bent Spoon, Dil Se, Los Salseros,
Common Origins, TapTH@T, and Swing
time. Within the fleeting moments of grand
beauty and fervor, we may very well find our
selves swelling with inspiration to achieve
our own great leaps and strides.
