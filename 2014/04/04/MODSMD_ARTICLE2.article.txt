## GAY AND Greek The 						push for 'active acceptance' within the Greek community 
### LUCY SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
As fraternity rush concludes its first
week and sorority rush approaches, the
challenges surrounding rush may be par
ticularly accentuated given the stereo
typically heteronormative culture struc
turing Greek life for members of Stan
ford's LGBTQ community, some of whom
enter the process with reservations about
whether or not they will be accepted.
"I definitely had some initial hesita
tion and reservations about the whole
process because of the fact that I am gay
and because it is so traditionally hetero
normative," said Brandon Caruso 'l6, a
member of Sigma Nu. "Overall, there are
definitely a couple of frats that I didn't
even consider, because of my personality
maybe, but [also] I didn't think I could see
any gay guys going there and that kind of
added to the feeling of being uncomfort
able with it."
When Rob Franklin 'l5, another
openly gay member of the Greek commu
nity, went through fraternity rush, he lim
ited his choices to just two fraternities.
"The decision to rush those two was
probably somewhat affected by my ideas
as a freshman on which fraternities were
gay-friendly," Franklin said.
Franklin reflected that thought
process might have been misguided.
"I think more of them are more gay

friendly than I would have thought as a
freshman," Franklin explained. "I have gay
friends in other fraternities as well who
have had completely great experiences
and I don't think that I would have
thought that as a freshman."
However, Franklin's perspective is
not uncommon, especially with regards to
rush. The Panhellenic system across
America is no stranger to allegations of
discrimination, and the traditional gender
segregation of fraternities and sororities
can make them seem especially unwel
come to queer-identifying students.
Franklin stressed that despite his
own positive experience, the Greek com
munity does seem closed off to students
in general intentionally or unintention
ally and particularly to minorities.
"I think that all of the Greek organi
zations just need to be more cognizant of
how their reputation knowing that
their reputation may be completely flawed
to what the actual community is like
looks like to the average Stanford stu
dent," Franklin said. "And if they care
about that and want to change that repu
tation then there are ways to show that
they are more welcoming communities."
Madeleine Kane 'l4, an openly
queer member of Chi Omega, has worked
to promote conversation and action about
LGBTQ issues within Greek
life.
"It seems like because people are so open
here, that people kind of assume that you are
okay with it," Kane said. "But what I've been
trying to tell people is the idea that active ac
ceptance makes people feel a lot more comfort
able than passive tolerance, and that goes for
every diversity issue as far as I can tell. It's bet
ter to just be very open and forward about it
and say we welcome you here. We are not very
good as a Greek community... [at] actively ex
tending a hand."
A bisexual member of Kappa Alpha Theta,
Mary, echoed those concerns, saying that lim
ited attempts to reach out are a bigger concern
than active discrimination. Mary's name has
been changed because she preferred to remain
anonymous for privacy reasons.
"We aren't doing anything to keep those
affected communities from believing that neg
ative things happen," she said. "We aren't
reaching out and saying 'Come over, you're
welcome any time; please rush, we're interest
ed in you as a person, not you as a sexuality,'
and there's a lot that can be done in terms of
broadening our efforts to do that."
While students agreed that the Greek
community has room for growth in promoting
active acceptance of sexual minorities, several
students also expressed frustration with the
LGBTQ community's own discrimination
against Greek life.
"I've met a lot of people in the LBGT
groups that do feel slightly against the Greek
system because they feel like there's a drive to
act a certain way within the system so they
feel that it restricts your ability to be an indi
vidual," said Jared Wolens 'l6, an openly gay
member of Sigma Nu. "I think that's wrong...
I've never once felt like I can't act like myself.
I've felt like I can be who I want and everyone
will embrace me for that and I think that's ex
actly what the LGBT groups' mission state
ments are you are who you and you should
be accepted for that so I don't see why we
can't assimilate and be one."

Matt Higgins 'l4, an openly gay member
of Theta Delta Chi, explained that after several
encounters with the LGBTQ community, he
felt discouraged from becoming more in
volved.

"I was afraid I wouldn't fit in as well in the
LGBT community, based on the people I knew
in it, and instead joined Theta Delt, a commu
nity I knew I was comfortable in," he said. "I
felt like more of a minority in the LGBT com
munity than I do in the Greek community."

Students framed the rush selection
process as a key opportunity to make potential

new members of all backgrounds feel wel
come in Greek communities. Higgins noted
that his fraternity made sure to flyer all of the
community centers and all of the themed
houses with rush posters in order to attract a
diverse group of people to rush.
"I think the first most influential thing is
not people saying 'hey, don't use that word'
but it's selection during rush," he said. "The
biggest thing that any fraternity can do in ap
proaching active acceptance is choosing to
have accepting and diverse people live there."
Franklin said he was pleasantly surprised
when his fraternity voted in two openly gay
guys without even considering their sexuality.
"I thought it definitely would have been
discussed not that it was any sort of factor
or deterrent but I figured that it was some
thing that they talked about and it just wasn't
a factor," he said.

He still asserted, however, that there is a
lot more that can be done.
"I think for the other fraternities that are
even interested in projecting themselves as
more accepting because I don't think every
fraternity is interested in doing that then
they could do a better job of actively showing
that they're allies if they are," Franklin said.
"Making sure that any queer people who are
rushing feel comfortable to be out during
rush, that the guys in the house can be vocal
about the fact that there are queer people in
the house and being very vocal about being ac
cepting and allies."

Various campus organizations have
worked to improve the perception of Greek
life on campus in recent years. For the past
four years, the LGBT Community Resources
Center and its Safe and Open Spaces at Stan
ford (SOSAS) program has focused specifically
on addressing LGBT life within Greek organi
zations during winter quarter. The fraternities
and sororities that accepted SOSAS panels this
year include Kappa Alpha, Kappa Sigma, Phi
Psi, Sigma Chi, Sigma Nu, Theta Delta Chi,
Delta Delta Delta and Kappa Alpha Theta.
There was also a general panel for unhoused
sororities.

"So far, I've had really positive experi
ences with the Greek communities," said Lau
rel Fish 'l4, the SOSAS coordinator. "I think
that the fraternities and sororities that I've
been able to work with ... are genuinely in
terested in learning and making their spaces
safer. For me, it's been a really positive experi
ence."
Some Greek organizations followed
through on the suggestions from the SOSAS
panels, putting up LGBT support flags and

stickers around the house.
Mary said that Theta is very cognizant
about being an inclusive community and has
followed through on suggestions from SOSAS.
"Everyone's always conscious about
sending out emails saying 'bring your date' in
stead of 'bring your man' and all of these other
seemingly small things that definitely make an
impact on how welcome LGBT members feel
in the Greek life," she said.
Kane also helped put on "Diversity Office
Hours" with the Greek Life Diversity Coalition
on Apr. 1.

"The idea is to sort of have a symbolic
event that is publicized so that people know
the door is open and that there are discussions
being had," Kane said. "It may not seem like it,
but we want to make that shift so that people
know the door is open for them to come to
rush and be in one of these organizations if
they want. Some people don't want to and
that's fine, but to not have people think that
it's closed to begin with."
Kane said that she has also proposed, and
gotten a positive response to, adding a diversi
ty chair to the Inter-Sorority Council (ISC) Ex
ecutive Board.

"That would be ideal as an institutional
push to make sure this kind of stuff is being
talked about and addressed eventually we'll
get away from just talking about it to address
ing it," she said.
Students also expressed interest in creat
ing a council to specifically address LGBT is
sues within the Greek community.
"When I got here freshman year, I was a
little bit surprised to realize that there were so
many LGBT resources, but none of them were
really affiliated to Greek life ... they were very
much isolated," Wolens said. "A fraternity or
sorority is going to have certain gender-norma
tive ideas associated with them. There might
be some LGBT issues that come up and there
should be a resource readily available for that."
Mary disputed the necessity of creating a
new resource, but instead suggested working
on creating a positive relationship between the
two existing communities.

"I feel like it's not as necessary to create
new systems as it is to integrate the old ones,"
she said. "It's just as much about making peo
ple in the Greek community feel welcome for
identifying as black, LGBT, what have you, as
it is to make them still feel welcome in their
old communities, so that they don't have to
give up something in order to join the Greek
system."

In April 1944, then-Stanford president
Donald Tressider announced the deci
sion to abolish sororities on Stanfords
campus. The Daily's article from April
27,1944 is reprinted below.
Sororities Abolished
Speaking in the way that has won him student
admiration, Dr. Donald B. Tresidder, president of
Stanford University, told the women of the Univer
sity last night that he had been authorized by the
Board of Trustees to announce that sororities on
this campus will be discontinued and that women's
housing will be unified under University owner
ship and supervision.
The Education Auditorium was packed, and
women were sitting in the aisles and on the stage
steps when they rose to applaud the present as he
left the stage. A moment later, as the audience
spontaneously broke into the Stanford Hymn, he
walked back on stage to join them.
As the last notes ended, he said, "That was the
nicest thing you could have done."
Decision Held
He did not announce the decision of the board
until he had gone through the events which led up
to the board's consideration of the sorority prob
lem.
He took the audience back to early 1943,
when 13 Roble sponsors sent the board a letter
stating their dissatisfaction with the sorority sys
tem at Stanford. The board chose a committee out
of their number, consisting of Mr. George A. Ditz,
Mr. Leland W. Cutler, Mr. W. Palmer Fuller Jr., Mrs.
Roger Goodan, Mr. Ira S. Lillick, and Judge M. C.
Sloss.
This group met with 19 women students rep
resenting both sides of the issue in March of that
year and this was followed by letters and more
meetings with alumnae and friends of Stanford.
The Failure of Plans
"In September, I came as president, along with
the Army," said Dr. Tresidder, as he went on to tell
of subsequent plans which had been considered by
Panhellenic but rejected by one or more houses.
He told of more meetings, conferences with
campus leaders, and finally of many fine things
which sororities have done for the University.
In conclusion, he praised the cooperation of
row women in trying to find a solution and then
announced the decision, which was received, as he
had asked, without demonstration of any kind.

safer. For me, it's been a really positive experi

Some Greek organizations followed
through on the suggestions from the SOSAS
panels, putting up LGBT support flags and

stickers around the house.
Mary said that Theta is very cognizant
about being an inclusive community and has
followed through on suggestions from SOSAS.
"Everyone's always conscious about
sending out emails saying 'bring your date' in
stead of 'bring your man' and all of these other
seemingly small things that definitely make an
impact on how welcome LGBT members feel
in the Greek life," she said.
Kane also helped put on "Diversity Office
Hours" with the Greek Life Diversity Coalition
on Apr. 1.

"The idea is to sort of have a symbolic
event that is publicized so that people know
the door is open and that there are discussions
being had," Kane said. "It may not seem like it,
but we want to make that shift so that people
know the door is open for them to come to
rush and be in one of these organizations if
they want. Some people don't want to and
that's fine, but to not have people think that
it's closed to begin with."
Kane said that she has also proposed, and
gotten a positive response to, adding a diversi
ty chair to the Inter-Sorority Council (ISC) Ex
ecutive Board.

"That would be ideal as an institutional
push to make sure this kind of stuff is being
talked about and addressed eventually we'll
get away from just talking about it to address
ing it," she said.
Students also expressed interest in creat
ing a council to specifically address LGBT is
sues within the Greek community.
"When I got here freshman year, I was a
little bit surprised to realize that there were so
many LGBT resources, but none of them were
really affiliated to Greek life ... they were very
much isolated," Wolens said. "A fraternity or
sorority is going to have certain gender-norma
tive ideas associated with them. There might
be some LGBT issues that come up and there
should be a resource readily available for that."
Mary disputed the necessity of creating a
new resource, but instead suggested working
on creating a positive relationship between the
two existing communities.

"I feel like it's not as necessary to create
new systems as it is to integrate the old ones,"
she said. "It's just as much about making peo
ple in the Greek community feel welcome for
identifying as black, LGBT, what have you, as
it is to make them still feel welcome in their
old communities, so that they don't have to
give up something in order to join the Greek
system."

In April 1944, then-Stanford president
Donald Tressider announced the deci
sion to abolish sororities on Stanfords
campus. The Daily's article from April
27,1944 is reprinted below.
Sororities Abolished
Speaking in the way that has won him student
admiration, Dr. Donald B. Tresidder, president of
Stanford University, told the women of the Univer
sity last night that he had been authorized by the
Board of Trustees to announce that sororities on
this campus will be discontinued and that women's
housing will be unified under University owner
ship and supervision.
The Education Auditorium was packed, and
women were sitting in the aisles and on the stage
steps when they rose to applaud the present as he
left the stage. A moment later, as the audience
spontaneously broke into the Stanford Hymn, he
walked back on stage to join them.
As the last notes ended, he said, "That was the
nicest thing you could have done."
Decision Held
He did not announce the decision of the board
until he had gone through the events which led up
to the board's consideration of the sorority prob
lem.
He took the audience back to early 1943,
when 13 Roble sponsors sent the board a letter
stating their dissatisfaction with the sorority sys
tem at Stanford. The board chose a committee out
of their number, consisting of Mr. George A. Ditz,
Mr. Leland W. Cutler, Mr. W. Palmer Fuller Jr., Mrs.
Roger Goodan, Mr. Ira S. Lillick, and Judge M. C.
Sloss.
This group met with 19 women students rep
resenting both sides of the issue in March of that
year and this was followed by letters and more
meetings with alumnae and friends of Stanford.
The Failure of Plans
"In September, I came as president, along with
the Army," said Dr. Tresidder, as he went on to tell
of subsequent plans which had been considered by
Panhellenic but rejected by one or more houses.
He told of more meetings, conferences with
campus leaders, and finally of many fine things
which sororities have done for the University.
In conclusion, he praised the cooperation of
row women in trying to find a solution and then
announced the decision, which was received, as he
had asked, without demonstration of any kind.

As fraternity rush concludes its first
week and sorority rush approaches, the
challenges surrounding rush may be par
ticularly accentuated given the stereo
typically heteronormative culture struc
turing Greek life for members of Stan
ford's LGBTQ community, some of whom
enter the process with reservations about
whether or not they will be accepted.
"I definitely had some initial hesita
tion and reservations about the whole
process because of the fact that I am gay
and because it is so traditionally hetero
normative," said Brandon Caruso 'l6, a
member of Sigma Nu. "Overall, there are
definitely a couple of frats that I didn't
even consider, because of my personality
maybe, but [also] I didn't think I could see
any gay guys going there and that kind of
added to the feeling of being uncomfort
able with it."
When Rob Franklin 'l5, another
openly gay member of the Greek commu
nity, went through fraternity rush, he lim
ited his choices to just two fraternities.
"The decision to rush those two was
probably somewhat affected by my ideas
as a freshman on which fraternities were
gay-friendly," Franklin said.
Franklin reflected that thought
process might have been misguided.
"I think more of them are more gay

friendly than I would have thought as a
freshman," Franklin explained. "I have gay
friends in other fraternities as well who
have had completely great experiences
and I don't think that I would have
thought that as a freshman."
However, Franklin's perspective is
not uncommon, especially with regards to
rush. The Panhellenic system across
America is no stranger to allegations of
discrimination, and the traditional gender
segregation of fraternities and sororities
can make them seem especially unwel
come to queer-identifying students.
Franklin stressed that despite his
own positive experience, the Greek com
munity does seem closed off to students
in general intentionally or unintention
ally and particularly to minorities.
"I think that all of the Greek organi
zations just need to be more cognizant of
how their reputation knowing that
their reputation may be completely flawed
to what the actual community is like
looks like to the average Stanford stu
dent," Franklin said. "And if they care
about that and want to change that repu
tation then there are ways to show that
they are more welcoming communities."
Madeleine Kane 'l4, an openly
queer member of Chi Omega, has worked
to promote conversation and action about
LGBTQ issues within Greek
life.
"It seems like because people are so open
here, that people kind of assume that you are
okay with it," Kane said. "But what I've been
trying to tell people is the idea that active ac
ceptance makes people feel a lot more comfort
able than passive tolerance, and that goes for
every diversity issue as far as I can tell. It's bet
ter to just be very open and forward about it
and say we welcome you here. We are not very
good as a Greek community... [at] actively ex
tending a hand."
A bisexual member of Kappa Alpha Theta,
Mary, echoed those concerns, saying that lim
ited attempts to reach out are a bigger concern
than active discrimination. Mary's name has
been changed because she preferred to remain
anonymous for privacy reasons.
"We aren't doing anything to keep those
affected communities from believing that neg
ative things happen," she said. "We aren't
reaching out and saying 'Come over, you're
welcome any time; please rush, we're interest
ed in you as a person, not you as a sexuality,'
and there's a lot that can be done in terms of
broadening our efforts to do that."
While students agreed that the Greek
community has room for growth in promoting
active acceptance of sexual minorities, several
students also expressed frustration with the
LGBTQ community's own discrimination
against Greek life.
"I've met a lot of people in the LBGT
groups that do feel slightly against the Greek
system because they feel like there's a drive to
act a certain way within the system so they
feel that it restricts your ability to be an indi
vidual," said Jared Wolens 'l6, an openly gay
member of Sigma Nu. "I think that's wrong...
I've never once felt like I can't act like myself.
I've felt like I can be who I want and everyone
will embrace me for that and I think that's ex
actly what the LGBT groups' mission state
ments are you are who you and you should
be accepted for that so I don't see why we
can't assimilate and be one."

Matt Higgins 'l4, an openly gay member
of Theta Delta Chi, explained that after several
encounters with the LGBTQ community, he
felt discouraged from becoming more in
volved.

"I was afraid I wouldn't fit in as well in the
LGBT community, based on the people I knew
in it, and instead joined Theta Delt, a commu
nity I knew I was comfortable in," he said. "I
felt like more of a minority in the LGBT com
munity than I do in the Greek community."

Students framed the rush selection
process as a key opportunity to make potential

new members of all backgrounds feel wel
come in Greek communities. Higgins noted
that his fraternity made sure to flyer all of the
community centers and all of the themed
houses with rush posters in order to attract a
diverse group of people to rush.
"I think the first most influential thing is
not people saying 'hey, don't use that word'
but it's selection during rush," he said. "The
biggest thing that any fraternity can do in ap
proaching active acceptance is choosing to
have accepting and diverse people live there."
Franklin said he was pleasantly surprised
when his fraternity voted in two openly gay
guys without even considering their sexuality.
"I thought it definitely would have been
discussed not that it was any sort of factor
or deterrent but I figured that it was some
thing that they talked about and it just wasn't
a factor," he said.

He still asserted, however, that there is a
lot more that can be done.
"I think for the other fraternities that are
even interested in projecting themselves as
more accepting because I don't think every
fraternity is interested in doing that then
they could do a better job of actively showing
that they're allies if they are," Franklin said.
"Making sure that any queer people who are
rushing feel comfortable to be out during
rush, that the guys in the house can be vocal
about the fact that there are queer people in
the house and being very vocal about being ac
cepting and allies."

Various campus organizations have
worked to improve the perception of Greek
life on campus in recent years. For the past
four years, the LGBT Community Resources
Center and its Safe and Open Spaces at Stan
ford (SOSAS) program has focused specifically
on addressing LGBT life within Greek organi
zations during winter quarter. The fraternities
and sororities that accepted SOSAS panels this
year include Kappa Alpha, Kappa Sigma, Phi
Psi, Sigma Chi, Sigma Nu, Theta Delta Chi,
Delta Delta Delta and Kappa Alpha Theta.
There was also a general panel for unhoused
sororities.

"So far, I've had really positive experi
ences with the Greek communities," said Lau
rel Fish 'l4, the SOSAS coordinator. "I think
that the fraternities and sororities that I've
been able to work with ... are genuinely in
terested in learning and making their spaces
safer. For me, it's been a really positive experi
ence."
Some Greek organizations followed
through on the suggestions from the SOSAS
panels, putting up LGBT support flags and

stickers around the house.
Mary said that Theta is very cognizant
about being an inclusive community and has
followed through on suggestions from SOSAS.
"Everyone's always conscious about
sending out emails saying 'bring your date' in
stead of 'bring your man' and all of these other
seemingly small things that definitely make an

life.
"It seems like because people are so open
here, that people kind of assume that you are
okay with it," Kane said. "But what I've been
trying to tell people is the idea that active ac
ceptance makes people feel a lot more comfort
able than passive tolerance, and that goes for
every diversity issue as far as I can tell. It's bet
ter to just be very open and forward about it
and say we welcome you here. We are not very
good as a Greek community... [at] actively ex
tending a hand."
A bisexual member of Kappa Alpha Theta,
Mary, echoed those concerns, saying that lim
ited attempts to reach out are a bigger concern
than active discrimination. Mary's name has
been changed because she preferred to remain
anonymous for privacy reasons.
"We aren't doing anything to keep those
affected communities from believing that neg
ative things happen," she said. "We aren't
reaching out and saying 'Come over, you're
welcome any time; please rush, we're interest
ed in you as a person, not you as a sexuality,'
and there's a lot that can be done in terms of
broadening our efforts to do that."
While students agreed that the Greek
community has room for growth in promoting
active acceptance of sexual minorities, several
students also expressed frustration with the
LGBTQ community's own discrimination
against Greek life.
"I've met a lot of people in the LBGT
groups that do feel slightly against the Greek
system because they feel like there's a drive to
act a certain way within the system so they
feel that it restricts your ability to be an indi
vidual," said Jared Wolens 'l6, an openly gay
member of Sigma Nu. "I think that's wrong...
I've never once felt like I can't act like myself.
I've felt like I can be who I want and everyone
will embrace me for that and I think that's ex
actly what the LGBT groups' mission state
ments are you are who you and you should
be accepted for that so I don't see why we
can't assimilate and be one."

Matt Higgins 'l4, an openly gay member
of Theta Delta Chi, explained that after several
encounters with the LGBTQ community, he
felt discouraged from becoming more in
volved.

"I was afraid I wouldn't fit in as well in the
LGBT community, based on the people I knew
in it, and instead joined Theta Delt, a commu
nity I knew I was comfortable in," he said. "I
felt like more of a minority in the LGBT com
munity than I do in the Greek community."

Students framed the rush selection
process as a key opportunity to make potential

new members of all backgrounds feel wel
come in Greek communities. Higgins noted
that his fraternity made sure to flyer all of the
community centers and all of the themed
houses with rush posters in order to attract a
diverse group of people to rush.
"I think the first most influential thing is
not people saying 'hey, don't use that word'
but it's selection during rush," he said. "The
biggest thing that any fraternity can do in ap
proaching active acceptance is choosing to
have accepting and diverse people live there."
Franklin said he was pleasantly surprised
when his fraternity voted in two openly gay
guys without even considering their sexuality.
"I thought it definitely would have been
discussed not that it was any sort of factor
or deterrent but I figured that it was some
thing that they talked about and it just wasn't
a factor," he said.

He still asserted, however, that there is a
lot more that can be done.
"I think for the other fraternities that are
even interested in projecting themselves as
more accepting because I don't think every
fraternity is interested in doing that then
they could do a better job of actively showing
that they're allies if they are," Franklin said.
"Making sure that any queer people who are
rushing feel comfortable to be out during
rush, that the guys in the house can be vocal
about the fact that there are queer people in
the house and being very vocal about being ac
cepting and allies."

Various campus organizations have
worked to improve the perception of Greek
life on campus in recent years. For the past
four years, the LGBT Community Resources
Center and its Safe and Open Spaces at Stan
ford (SOSAS) program has focused specifically
on addressing LGBT life within Greek organi
zations during winter quarter. The fraternities
and sororities that accepted SOSAS panels this
year include Kappa Alpha, Kappa Sigma, Phi
Psi, Sigma Chi, Sigma Nu, Theta Delta Chi,
Delta Delta Delta and Kappa Alpha Theta.
There was also a general panel for unhoused
sororities.

"So far, I've had really positive experi
ences with the Greek communities," said Lau
rel Fish 'l4, the SOSAS coordinator. "I think
that the fraternities and sororities that I've
been able to work with ... are genuinely in
terested in learning and making their spaces
safer. For me, it's been a really positive experi
ence."
Some Greek organizations followed
through on the suggestions from the SOSAS
panels, putting up LGBT support flags and

stickers around the house.
Mary said that Theta is very cognizant
about being an inclusive community and has
followed through on suggestions from SOSAS.
"Everyone's always conscious about
sending out emails saying 'bring your date' in
stead of 'bring your man' and all of these other
seemingly small things that definitely make an
impact on how welcome LGBT members feel
in the Greek life," she said.
Kane also helped put on "Diversity Office
Hours" with the Greek Life Diversity Coalition
on Apr. 1.

"The idea is to sort of have a symbolic
event that is publicized so that people know
the door is open and that there are discussions
being had," Kane said. "It may not seem like it,
but we want to make that shift so that people
know the door is open for them to come to
rush and be in one of these organizations if
they want. Some people don't want to and
that's fine, but to not have people think that
it's closed to begin with."
Kane said that she has also proposed, and
gotten a positive response to, adding a diversi
ty chair to the Inter-Sorority Council (ISC) Ex
ecutive Board.

"That would be ideal as an institutional
push to make sure this kind of stuff is being
talked about and addressed eventually we'll
get away from just talking about it to address
ing it," she said.
Students also expressed interest in creat
ing a council to specifically address LGBT is

"When I got here freshman year, I was a

In April 1944, then-Stanford president
Donald Tressider announced the deci
sion to abolish sororities on Stanfords
campus. The Daily's article from April
27,1944 is reprinted below.
Sororities Abolished
Speaking in the way that has won him student
admiration, Dr. Donald B. Tresidder, president of
Stanford University, told the women of the Univer
sity last night that he had been authorized by the
Board of Trustees to announce that sororities on
this campus will be discontinued and that women's
housing will be unified under University owner
ship and supervision.
The Education Auditorium was packed, and
women were sitting in the aisles and on the stage
steps when they rose to applaud the present as he
left the stage. A moment later, as the audience
spontaneously broke into the Stanford Hymn, he
walked back on stage to join them.
As the last notes ended, he said, "That was the
nicest thing you could have done."
Decision Held
He did not announce the decision of the board
until he had gone through the events which led up
to the board's consideration of the sorority prob
lem.
He took the audience back to early 1943,
when 13 Roble sponsors sent the board a letter
stating their dissatisfaction with the sorority sys
tem at Stanford. The board chose a committee out
of their number, consisting of Mr. George A. Ditz,
Mr. Leland W. Cutler, Mr. W. Palmer Fuller Jr., Mrs.
Roger Goodan, Mr. Ira S. Lillick, and Judge M. C.
Sloss.
This group met with 19 women students rep
resenting both sides of the issue in March of that
year and this was followed by letters and more
meetings with alumnae and friends of Stanford.
The Failure of Plans
"In September, I came as president, along with
the Army," said Dr. Tresidder, as he went on to tell
of subsequent plans which had been considered by
Panhellenic but rejected by one or more houses.
He told of more meetings, conferences with
campus leaders, and finally of many fine things
which sororities have done for the University.
In conclusion, he praised the cooperation of
row women in trying to find a solution and then
announced the decision, which was received, as he
had asked, without demonstration of any kind.

As fraternity rush concludes its first
week and sorority rush approaches, the
challenges surrounding rush may be par
ticularly accentuated given the stereo
typically heteronormative culture struc
turing Greek life for members of Stan
ford's LGBTQ community, some of whom
enter the process with reservations about
whether or not they will be accepted.
"I definitely had some initial hesita
tion and reservations about the whole
process because of the fact that I am gay
and because it is so traditionally hetero
normative," said Brandon Caruso 'l6, a
member of Sigma Nu. "Overall, there are
definitely a couple of frats that I didn't
even consider, because of my personality
maybe, but [also] I didn't think I could see
any gay guys going there and that kind of
added to the feeling of being uncomfort
able with it."
When Rob Franklin 'l5, another
openly gay member of the Greek commu
nity, went through fraternity rush, he lim
ited his choices to just two fraternities.
"The decision to rush those two was
probably somewhat affected by my ideas
as a freshman on which fraternities were
gay-friendly," Franklin said.
Franklin reflected that thought
process might have been misguided.
"I think more of them are more gay

friendly than I would have thought as a
freshman," Franklin explained. "I have gay
friends in other fraternities as well who
have had completely great experiences
and I don't think that I would have
thought that as a freshman."
However, Franklin's perspective is
not uncommon, especially with regards to
rush. The Panhellenic system across
America is no stranger to allegations of
discrimination, and the traditional gender
segregation of fraternities and sororities
can make them seem especially unwel
come to queer-identifying students.
Franklin stressed that despite his
own positive experience, the Greek com
munity does seem closed off to students
in general intentionally or unintention
ally and particularly to minorities.
"I think that all of the Greek organi
zations just need to be more cognizant of
how their reputation knowing that
their reputation may be completely flawed
to what the actual community is like
looks like to the average Stanford stu
dent," Franklin said. "And if they care
about that and want to change that repu
tation then there are ways to show that
they are more welcoming communities."
Madeleine Kane 'l4, an openly
queer member of Chi Omega, has worked
to promote conversation and action about
LGBTQ issues within Greek
life.
"It seems like because people are so open
here, that people kind of assume that you are
okay with it," Kane said. "But what I've been
trying to tell people is the idea that active ac
ceptance makes people feel a lot more comfort
able than passive tolerance, and that goes for

and say we welcome you here. We are not very

A bisexual member of Kappa Alpha Theta,
Mary, echoed those concerns, saying that lim

give up something in order to join the Greek
system."

In April 1944, then-Stanford president
Donald Tressider announced the deci
sion to abolish sororities on Stanfords
campus. The Daily's article from April
27,1944 is reprinted below.
Sororities Abolished
Speaking in the way that has won him student
admiration, Dr. Donald B. Tresidder, president of
Stanford University, told the women of the Univer
sity last night that he had been authorized by the
Board of Trustees to announce that sororities on
this campus will be discontinued and that women's
housing will be unified under University owner
ship and supervision.
The Education Auditorium was packed, and
women were sitting in the aisles and on the stage
steps when they rose to applaud the present as he
left the stage. A moment later, as the audience
spontaneously broke into the Stanford Hymn, he
walked back on stage to join them.
As the last notes ended, he said, "That was the
nicest thing you could have done."
Decision Held
He did not announce the decision of the board
until he had gone through the events which led up
to the board's consideration of the sorority prob
lem.
He took the audience back to early 1943,
when 13 Roble sponsors sent the board a letter
stating their dissatisfaction with the sorority sys
tem at Stanford. The board chose a committee out
of their number, consisting of Mr. George A. Ditz,
Mr. Leland W. Cutler, Mr. W. Palmer Fuller Jr., Mrs.
Roger Goodan, Mr. Ira S. Lillick, and Judge M. C.
Sloss.
This group met with 19 women students rep
resenting both sides of the issue in March of that
year and this was followed by letters and more
meetings with alumnae and friends of Stanford.
The Failure of Plans
"In September, I came as president, along with
the Army," said Dr. Tresidder, as he went on to tell
of subsequent plans which had been considered by
Panhellenic but rejected by one or more houses.
He told of more meetings, conferences with
campus leaders, and finally of many fine things
which sororities have done for the University.
In conclusion, he praised the cooperation of
row women in trying to find a solution and then
announced the decision, which was received, as he
had asked, without demonstration of any kind.
