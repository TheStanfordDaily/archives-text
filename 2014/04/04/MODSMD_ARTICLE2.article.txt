## GAY AND Greek The
						push for 'active acceptance' within the Greek community 
### LUCY SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
As fraternity rush concludes its first
week and sorority rush approaches, the
challenges surrounding rush may be par
ticularly accentuated given the stereo
typically heteronormative culture struc
turing Greek life for members of Stan
ford's LGBTQ community, some of whom
enter the process with reservations about
whether or not they will be accepted.
"I definitely had some initial hesita
tion and reservations about the whole
process because of the fact that I am gay
and because it is so traditionally hetero
normative," said Brandon Caruso 'l6, a
member of Sigma Nu. "Overall, there are
definitely a couple of frats that I didn't
even consider, because of my personality
maybe, but [also] I didn't think I could see
any gay guys going there and that kind of
added to the feeling of being uncomfort
able with it."
When Rob Franklin 'l5, another
openly gay member of the Greek commu
nity, went through fraternity rush, he lim
ited his choices to just two fraternities.
"The decision to rush those two was
probably somewhat affected by my ideas
as a freshman on which fraternities were
gay-friendly," Franklin said.
Franklin reflected that thought
process might have been misguided.
"I think more of them are more gay

friendly than I would have thought as a
freshman," Franklin explained. "I have gay
friends in other fraternities as well who
have had completely great experiences
and I don't think that I would have
thought that as a freshman."
However, Franklin's perspective is
not uncommon, especially with regards to
rush. The Panhellenic system across
America is no stranger to allegations of
discrimination, and the traditional gender
segregation of fraternities and sororities
can make them seem especially unwel
come to queer-identifying students.
Franklin stressed that despite his
own positive experience, the Greek com
munity does seem closed off to students
in general intentionally or unintention
ally and particularly to minorities.
"I think that all of the Greek organi
zations just need to be more cognizant of
how their reputation knowing that
their reputation may be completely flawed
to what the actual community is like
looks like to the average Stanford stu
dent," Franklin said. "And if they care
about that and want to change that repu
tation then there are ways to show that
they are more welcoming communities."
