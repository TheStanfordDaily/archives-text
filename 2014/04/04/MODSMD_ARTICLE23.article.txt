## Inside the SFIFF press conference 
### SARAH SALAMEH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Noah Cowan, who recently assumed
his new role as executive director
of the San Francisco Film Society
(SFFS), opened the San Francisco
International Film Festival (SFIFF)
press conference on Tuesday
morning by discussing his excitement at
becoming involved with the Bay Area film
scene. After stepping down as artistic di
rector for the Toronto International Film
Festival, where he spent over 10 years,
Cowan said that he is ready to take on
and embrace the Bay Area's film and arts
culture.

"I'm more interested in experiencing
it [the festival] with the citizens of the
Bay Area," Cowan said. "The cultural life
of San Francisco and the Bay is extremely
integrated, so I think understanding how
both the festival and the Film Society op
erate within the larger ecology here is re
ally key."
Rachel Rosen, director of program
ming for the San Francisco Film Society,
joined Cowan on the panel, alongside Rod
Armstrong, Audrey Chang and Sean Uye
hara from the programming team.
Rosen explained that while the festi
val aims to host films with diverse global
narratives and perspectives, it also aims
to choose films that will resonate with
and "speak to" the San Francisco Bay Area
audience. She cited the film "Palo Alto,"
based on a book of stories by James Fran
co and directed by Gia Coppola, as an es
pecially appropriate choice as the festi
val's Centerpiece Film.
