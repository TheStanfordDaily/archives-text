## Inside the SFIFF press conference 
### SARAH SALAMEH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Noah Cowan, who recently assumed
his new role as executive director
of the San Francisco Film Society
(SFFS), opened the San Francisco
International Film Festival (SFIFF)
press conference on Tuesday
morning by discussing his excitement at
becoming involved with the Bay Area film
scene. After stepping down as artistic di
rector for the Toronto International Film
Festival, where he spent over 10 years,
Cowan said that he is ready to take on
and embrace the Bay Area's film and arts
culture.

"I'm more interested in experiencing
it [the festival] with the citizens of the
Bay Area," Cowan said. "The cultural life
of San Francisco and the Bay is extremely
integrated, so I think understanding how
both the festival and the Film Society op
erate within the larger ecology here is re
ally key."
Rachel Rosen, director of program
ming for the San Francisco Film Society,
joined Cowan on the panel, alongside Rod
Armstrong, Audrey Chang and Sean Uye
hara from the programming team.
Rosen explained that while the festi
val aims to host films with diverse global
narratives and perspectives, it also aims
to choose films that will resonate with
and "speak to" the San Francisco Bay Area
audience. She cited the film "Palo Alto,"
based on a book of stories by James Fran
co and directed by Gia Coppola, as an es
pecially appropriate choice as the festi
val's Centerpiece Film.
Rosen also emphasized Coppola's artistic talent and visual skills, not
ing that "even though this is territory that has been covered by her
family and many others the perilous teenage years she defi
nitely has her own way of empathizing with these characters, while
still being very authentic about the real issues at play."
The concern of films resonating with the Bay audience may also
explain imbalances in global representation in the festival. The pro
grammers included many Latin American films this year, five of
which are in the festival's World Cinema Spotlight: "All About the
Feathers" (Costa Rica), "The Amazing Catfish" (Mexico), "Bad Flair"
(Venezuela/Peru), "History of Fear" (Argentina), and "The Militant"
(Uruguay).

By contrast, there are only three Middle Eastern Films: "The Re
turn of Homs," which offers a localized view on the transformation
of peaceful Syrian protests into a bloody civil war; the Turkish film

"The Blue Wave," which follows a teenage girl's first year of high
school; and the Persian film "Manuscripts Don't Burn," which chron
icles the life of a father working as a contract killer to gather money
for his ill son and for a group of writers threatened by the secret
service with regards to the publication of certain manuscripts.
Cowan described the Closing Night film, "Alex of Venice," actor
Chris Messina's ("The Mindy Project") directorial debut, as a tale
about accepting the unexpected.

"Films by actors sometimes are a bit of a treacherous place for
film festivals to go they've often been confined to TV movies and
such but this is a really wonderful exception to the rule," Cowan
explained. "[Messina] has created an extremely careful portrait of a
family in distress."
