lead vocalist, the concert featured his eight
sons: Raza Hussein at the harmonium and

choirs, Sarfraz Hussein at the harmonium

everyone else as the ensemble of Choristers
and Clappers.
Khan opened the concert with a per

as uniquely "closed eyes" and "clasped
hands" and drew attention to its potential to

Khan's distinctive qawwali style, which rests
upon a constant dialogue between the

thrilling and the soothing. The musicians al

full-throated, spiraling rhythms and vocals.

coming to shore.
The concert continued with a popular
rendition of "Allah Hoo," which set up the
Sufi themes of divine love, its numerous
manifestations, and yearning for commun
ion. The group also played the Ã¼biquitous
