# STUDENT LIFE
## The 						price of going Greek Discussing the financial accessibility of Greek life 
### MADDY SIDES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As Stanford's Greek organizations prepare
for the annual spring recruitment season,
Greek community leaders have sought to foster
a more open conversation regarding the finan
cial accessibility of Greek life.
"We hope to create an environment in
which the Greek chapters are expecting and
even encouraging potential new members to
ask questions about the financial support avail
able and the costs associated with Greek mem
bership," said Doug Calhoun, Stanford's Inter-
Sorority Council (ISC) advisor.
Although there is no cost for entering the
Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) recruitment or
"rush" process, the ISC recruitment process
does require a $35 fee from potential new
members. Amanda Rodriguez, the IFC advisor,
attributed the existence of that fee to higher
overhead costs due to room bookings and other
processes built into rush's structure.
"We have worked to increase funding for
fee waivers for new members, and the number
of fee waivers offered this year is double what
it was in the past," Rodriguez said.
However, communication about financial ex
pectations for subsequent membership, particu
larly for men, has been inconsistent in past years.
"The specific costs of fraternity member
ship are not broadly addressed during rush
other than in one-on-one conversations," said
Baker Tilney 'l5, chapter president of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon and former IFC Financial Chair.
"Perhaps IFC could play a larger role in the fi
nancial aspects of members' experiences, and
that could have a positive effect on the finan
cial accessibility. I would say that on the chap
ter level, I am proud of my house. We do a
good job of making our house inclusive to
members of all backgrounds through waivers
and payment plan options for quarterly dues."
In the past year, both ISC and IFC lead
ership have launched new efforts to better
support members who need help paying chap
ter dues as well as publicizing the fact that
there are options available for students who
don't think they can afford Greek member
ship.

"While ISC is able to help by paying the
recruitment fee, we felt like we should be do
ing more to help potential new members who
need financial assistance later on in the Greek
process," said Taylor Dewberry 'l4, the presi
dent of the ISC.

Dewberry noted that the ISC plans to cre
ate a Women's Greek Leadership scholarship
through various grants that would aim to pay
for a significant portion of the individual's dues
throughout her undergraduate experience.
While this idea is still in the conceptual stage,
the ISC has worked to save funds and discover
grants that could help complete the project in
the near future.

Meanwhile, IFC leadership has also made
plans to increase fraternity life's financial ac
cessibility.
"The hope is to use the fees that each
chapter pays to IFC to create a general scholar
ship or rainy day fund for IFC members and
chapters to access in the event of financial bur
den or inability to pay chapter dues," Tilney said.
Required membership dues in IFC and ISC
chapters vary by chapter and by quarter and are
composed of several types of fees. Each Greek
organization chapter on Stanford's campus is af
filiated with a different national organization.
National organizations vary in size and the
amount of costs they incur for things like insur
ance. Depending on how much of these costs
are passed along to local chapters, every chapter
on campus may have different national dues.
In an informational pamphlet about ISC re
cruitment for 2014, reported quarterly dues for
the seven different chapters ranged from $2OO
to $250 per member. Five of seven chapters re
ported having "scholarships available."

Scholarships to help offset or completely
cover membership dues exist on a chapter-to
chapter basis.
"Scholarship availability generally depends
on the opportunities provided at the national
level, which Stanford students often receive,
the operating budget of the chapter, and things
like the presence of local alumnus groups that
support chapters." Rodriguez said.
On top of this, new members and seniors
often pay a one-time set of initiation or alumnus
fees.

"In general, our chapters work hard to keep
costs consistent and as low as possible for their
members, but like in any student group, there
are fees associated with membership," Ro
driguez said.
However, members of Greek organizations
do face fees outside of the structured quarterly

dues.
"I do not think Greek organizations are es
pecially financially accessible, but I do think
sororities are much more accessible than frater
nities based on what I know about both sys
tems," said former Pi Beta Phi financial officer
Ally Huchro 'l5.
These discrepancies between the true cost
of sorority and fraternity membership may come
from the higher "social fees" that fraternities in
cur, although it is hard to determine the actual
cost associated with this type of fee.
"There are, of course, fees for things like
social events or apparel that members can
choose to pay," Rodriguez said. "Butwe consid
er these 'add-ons' and they are not actually re
quired for membership."
