## The
						price of going Greek Discussing the financial accessibility of Greek life 
### MADDY SIDES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As Stanford's Greek organizations prepare
for the annual spring recruitment season,
Greek community leaders have sought to foster
a more open conversation regarding the finan
cial accessibility of Greek life.
"We hope to create an environment in
which the Greek chapters are expecting and
even encouraging potential new members to
ask questions about the financial support avail
able and the costs associated with Greek mem
bership," said Doug Calhoun, Stanford's Inter-
Sorority Council (ISC) advisor.
Although there is no cost for entering the
Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) recruitment or
"rush" process, the ISC recruitment process
does require a $35 fee from potential new
members. Amanda Rodriguez, the IFC advisor,
attributed the existence of that fee to higher
overhead costs due to room bookings and other
processes built into rush's structure.
"We have worked to increase funding for
fee waivers for new members, and the number
of fee waivers offered this year is double what
it was in the past," Rodriguez said.
However, communication about financial ex
pectations for subsequent membership, particu
larly for men, has been inconsistent in past years.
