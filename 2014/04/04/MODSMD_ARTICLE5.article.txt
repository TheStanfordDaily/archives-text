# New Greek coalition addresses diversity

### SILVIANA ILCUS 
In an effort to address discrimination
against students from marginalized back
grounds within Stanford's Panhellenic sorori
ties, the Greek Life Diversity Coalition
emerged earlier this year with the intent of
promoting diversity within those organiza
tions.

The coalition has so far worked to trans
form the rush process into a more comfortable
and accessible event for people from under
represented socioeconomic and ethnic com
munities. The coalition also encouraged Inter-
Sorority Council (ISC) sororities to hold diver
sity training events before the start of the rush
process and has held diversity office hours di
rected at prospective members of Greek life.
According to Jackie Fielder' 16, a member
of Alpha Phi and one of the coalition's
founders, the idea for forming the coalition be
gan after Fielder spoke on a diversity panel
hosted by the ISC that addressed low-income
students in Greek life.

"Even though I couldn't relate to all the
girls who had ethnic and racial issues within
the Greek community, or to dealing with men
tal health challenges, I could relate with how

isolated they felt in the Greek community,"
Fielder said.

Fielder explained that she had previously
considered deactivating because of the under
representation of students from marginalized
communities as well as the lack of conversa
tion regarding the issue.
"So much of my identity plays into what I
do on a daily basis... and I [had] felt like the
Greek system was not for me," she said.

Fielder and Delta Delta Delta members
Sierra Kaplan-Nelson 'l6 and Jazlyn Patricio-
Archer 'l6 formed a Facebook group for the
organization after the event. Since then, the
group has grown to currently encompass ap
proximately 40 members from various ISC
sororities while garnering ISC support.
The coalition has largely focused on insti
tutional procedures like rush, which the
founders framed as a principal factor in estab
lishing the Greek community's identity. Patri
cio-Archer noted that even the content of
questions asked during the rush process might
discriminate against girls from marginalized
backgrounds.
