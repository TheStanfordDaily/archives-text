"In general, I think that the Greek sys
tem does not reflect Stanford's full di
versity and you see a very narrow scope
of the type of students that we have
here. In part, I think that comes from
income because it is an expensive thing
to be able to pay dues every quarter
although they do accommodate. I think
that still knowing that there are dues
can make students feel uncomfortable
a lot of students will not rush or
consider Greek life because it's some
thing that they wouldn't be able to af
ford."

"It's a very self-selecting thing in the
sense that you have to pay dues. And
there are supportive resources and oth
er options for people who can't afford
that but that is probably a deterrent for
someone who is coming from a low-in
come background."

-Rob Franklin 'l5, Sigma Nu

"I feel like the reason it's not addressed
is because there is such a stigma asso
ciated with income level. No one wants
to say, 'l'm poor, help me out' because
it's a level of pride almost or embarrass
ment because you're worried that peo
ple will judge you or worried that
you're sucking away too many re
sources. A lot of the people that I've
spoken with that have received scholar
ships or some sort of subsidy to being
in Greek life are always concerned that
someone else needs it more than them
and they don't want to take that oppor
tunity away from someone because
they know how much it could mean."
