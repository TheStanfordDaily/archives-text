## On Special-Interest Sororities 
### Kim Huynh 
It catches you off-guard sometimes. Like when
you're buzzed, nursing a beer on the balcony of
some frat and your special dinner date asks:

"So what's it like hanging out with Asian girls
all the time?"

"Bet you guys don't know how to drink like
this, do you."
And my personal favorite:
"So what, you guys only pair up with other
Asian frats?"

Microaggressions or not, I'll admit these are
fair questions to the casual observer. Telling anyone
I'm a member of one of Stanford's Asian-interest
sororities is bound to if not raise eyebrows
cause eyes to widen and heads to nod vigorously,
understandingly, with just the tiniest bit of veiled
condescension:
"Oh, yes! That's... cool."

And maybe it's my fault, for feeling the need to
qualify "My sorority? I'm in Sigma Psi Zeta." with "
... it's one of the Asian-interest sororities" every
time. As with any other organization that holds eth
nicity or culture as a common ground, there's
bound to be a few surrounding misconceptions,
stereotypes and stigmas. While I can't claim this

piece will disabuse you of these notions (I'm on a
deadline and that'd be too much work), I can share
my thought process and a few of the perks in choos
ing to join an Asian-interest sorority over a "regular"
one.

Size Matters
In any given year, Sigma Psi Zeta Sorority, Inc.
averages about 25 active members, with a new in
take class of 11 every spring. Compared to the typ
ical 30-40 girls an ISC sorority takes in during re
cruitment, that's tiny. But as any girl who's stood in
heels and had to shout small talk over hundreds of
other voices during ISC Rush will tell you, the sheer
size and anonymity of the process is nothing if not
intimidating, overwhelming and exhausting. While
I imagine that most girls who make it through that
gauntlet are happy in whatever sorority they end up
in, I've heard horror stories of girls not being able
to put names to faces of sisters in their own year.
SYZ's intimate size was a strong part of its ap
peal to me. Every sister knows almost every sister
