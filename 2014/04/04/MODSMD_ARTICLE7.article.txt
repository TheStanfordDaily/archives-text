## On Special-Interest Sororities 
### Kim Huynh 
It catches you off-guard sometimes. Like when
you're buzzed, nursing a beer on the balcony of
some frat and your special dinner date asks:

"So what's it like hanging out with Asian girls
all the time?"

"Bet you guys don't know how to drink like
this, do you."
And my personal favorite:
"So what, you guys only pair up with other
Asian frats?"

Microaggressions or not, I'll admit these are
fair questions to the casual observer. Telling anyone
I'm a member of one of Stanford's Asian-interest
sororities is bound to if not raise eyebrows
cause eyes to widen and heads to nod vigorously,
understandingly, with just the tiniest bit of veiled
condescension:
"Oh, yes! That's... cool."

And maybe it's my fault, for feeling the need to
qualify "My sorority? I'm in Sigma Psi Zeta." with "
... it's one of the Asian-interest sororities" every
time. As with any other organization that holds eth
nicity or culture as a common ground, there's
bound to be a few surrounding misconceptions,
stereotypes and stigmas. While I can't claim this

piece will disabuse you of these notions (I'm on a
deadline and that'd be too much work), I can share
my thought process and a few of the perks in choos
ing to join an Asian-interest sorority over a "regular"
one.

Size Matters
In any given year, Sigma Psi Zeta Sorority, Inc.
averages about 25 active members, with a new in
take class of 11 every spring. Compared to the typ
ical 30-40 girls an ISC sorority takes in during re
cruitment, that's tiny. But as any girl who's stood in
heels and had to shout small talk over hundreds of
other voices during ISC Rush will tell you, the sheer
size and anonymity of the process is nothing if not
intimidating, overwhelming and exhausting. While
I imagine that most girls who make it through that
gauntlet are happy in whatever sorority they end up
in, I've heard horror stories of girls not being able
to put names to faces of sisters in their own year.
SYZ's intimate size was a strong part of its ap
peal to me. Every sister knows almost every sister

perhaps a little better than she'd
like to, but that's exactly the right
amount of knowing that makes for
a genuinely-tight, close-knit com
munity. I room with an SYZ, I see
SYZsters (sorry not sorry) every
day, and I always, always always
know there is someone to call,
someone to talk to and someone I
can ask for help from if I need it.
♦ ♦♦
Room for Leadership
A smaller organization means
that most girls will hold some sort
of officer position at some point in
their undergrad experience, and
taking on leadership roles in SYZ
has been one of the most formative
experiences I've had at Stanford.
As a past rush chair, philanthropy
chair and president, it has been in
credibly rewarding to initiate
events, pull the house together and
see them come to fruition. I would
not have had half the capability and
confidence I'd have had today if
not for the experiences of planning
a rush, domestic violence aware

ness week or even just running
weekly chapter meetings. It's also
been amazing to see younger, per
haps less-assertive girls pushed into
positions where they're forced to
grow and, eventually, find their
own voice.
♦ ♦♦
So what does being Asian-inter
est mean?
It means nothing, except that
our ancestors at one point or an
other came from Asia. The fact is,
Sigma Psi Zeta is incredibly diverse
both nationally, with sisters com
ing from all over the world and the
United States, but personality
wise as well. Maybe some of us
like to pole dance, and maybe
some of us are black belts in
karate. Some of us wear dresses
every day, and some of us have
worn only black since the seventh
grade. Yes, some of us like boba,
and some like K-pop, but don't for a
second think that being Asian de
fines everything about us, or even
that you can define "being Asian"
in one way.

The fact is, you join a sorority
because you like the people. Asian
interest or not, I chose Sigma Psi
Zeta because I believed the girls to
be polished, pulled-together,

friendly, genuine, kind, fascinating,
accomplished and beautiful
every one of them.
I'm biased, I know. Most
Greeks are about their own organi
zations. This stems from the fact
that joining any fraternity or soror
ity let alone building the bonds
that allow us to call each other
brothers or sisters takes a huge
amount of time and effort.

I do firmly believe, however,
that no one sorority is objectively
and definitively better than the oth
er. We all have our philanthropies,
our mixers, our retreats and our
formals. We have our inside jokes,
connected and supportive net
works and amazing alumnae. We all
lay claim to the tightest bonds and
the closest-knit sisterhood. Ulti
mately, however, it's a matter of
choosing the sorority whose mem
bers you both admire and connect
with best. Large or small, ISC or
MGC, you're choosing to spend
the next four years with these peo
ple make damn sure you're
proud to call them sisters.

It means nothing, except that
our ancestors at one point or an
other came from Asia. The fact is,
Sigma Psi Zeta is incredibly diverse
both nationally, with sisters com
ing from all over the world and the
United States, but personality
wise as well. Maybe some of us
like to pole dance, and maybe
some of us are black belts in
karate. Some of us wear dresses
every day, and some of us have
worn only black since the seventh
grade. Yes, some of us like boba,
and some like K-pop, but don't for a
second think that being Asian de
fines everything about us, or even
that you can define "being Asian"
in one way.

The fact is, you join a sorority
because you like the people. Asian
interest or not, I chose Sigma Psi
Zeta because I believed the girls to
be polished, pulled-together,

friendly, genuine, kind, fascinating,
accomplished and beautiful
every one of them.
I'm biased, I know. Most
Greeks are about their own organi
zations. This stems from the fact
that joining any fraternity or soror
ity let alone building the bonds
that allow us to call each other
brothers or sisters takes a huge
amount of time and effort.

I do firmly believe, however,
that no one sorority is objectively
and definitively better than the oth
er. We all have our philanthropies,
our mixers, our retreats and our
formals. We have our inside jokes,
connected and supportive net
works and amazing alumnae. We all
lay claim to the tightest bonds and
the closest-knit sisterhood. Ulti
mately, however, it's a matter of
choosing the sorority whose mem
bers you both admire and connect
with best. Large or small, ISC or
MGC, you're choosing to spend
the next four years with these peo
ple make damn sure you're
proud to call them sisters.

It catches you off-guard sometimes. Like when
you're buzzed, nursing a beer on the balcony of
some frat and your special dinner date asks:

"So what's it like hanging out with Asian girls
all the time?"

"Bet you guys don't know how to drink like
this, do you."
And my personal favorite:
"So what, you guys only pair up with other
Asian frats?"

Microaggressions or not, I'll admit these are
fair questions to the casual observer. Telling anyone
I'm a member of one of Stanford's Asian-interest
sororities is bound to if not raise eyebrows
cause eyes to widen and heads to nod vigorously,
understandingly, with just the tiniest bit of veiled
condescension:
"Oh, yes! That's... cool."

And maybe it's my fault, for feeling the need to
qualify "My sorority? I'm in Sigma Psi Zeta." with "
... it's one of the Asian-interest sororities" every
time. As with any other organization that holds eth
nicity or culture as a common ground, there's
bound to be a few surrounding misconceptions,
stereotypes and stigmas. While I can't claim this

piece will disabuse you of these notions (I'm on a
deadline and that'd be too much work), I can share
my thought process and a few of the perks in choos
ing to join an Asian-interest sorority over a "regular"
one.
♦ ♦♦
Size Matters
In any given year, Sigma Psi Zeta Sorority, Inc.
averages about 25 active members, with a new in
take class of 11 every spring. Compared to the typ
ical 30-40 girls an ISC sorority takes in during re
cruitment, that's tiny. But as any girl who's stood in
heels and had to shout small talk over hundreds of
other voices during ISC Rush will tell you, the sheer
size and anonymity of the process is nothing if not
intimidating, overwhelming and exhausting. While
I imagine that most girls who make it through that
gauntlet are happy in whatever sorority they end up
in, I've heard horror stories of girls not being able
to put names to faces of sisters in their own year.
SYZ's intimate size was a strong part of its ap
peal to me. Every sister knows almost every sister

perhaps a little better than she'd
like to, but that's exactly the right
amount of knowing that makes for
a genuinely-tight, close-knit com
munity. I room with an SYZ, I see
SYZsters (sorry not sorry) every
day, and I always, always always
know there is someone to call,
someone to talk to and someone I
can ask for help from if I need it.

Room for Leadership
A smaller organization means
that most girls will hold some sort
of officer position at some point in
their undergrad experience, and
taking on leadership roles in SYZ
has been one of the most formative
experiences I've had at Stanford.
As a past rush chair, philanthropy
chair and president, it has been in
credibly rewarding to initiate
events, pull the house together and
see them come to fruition. I would
not have had half the capability and
confidence I'd have had today if
not for the experiences of planning
a rush, domestic violence aware

ness week or even just running
weekly chapter meetings. It's also
been amazing to see younger, per
haps less-assertive girls pushed into
positions where they're forced to
grow and, eventually, find their
own voice.
