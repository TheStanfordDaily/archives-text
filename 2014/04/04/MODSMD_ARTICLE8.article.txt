## Op-Ed Rush, Sororities and the Stanford Social Puzzle 
### Amanda Brockbank 
When I was home for spring
break, I was sitting around
with two of my closest
friends, one of whom is in the same
sorority as I am at Colorado, and the
other who is not involved in Greek life
at all at her small liberal arts school.
Offhand, I jokingly mentioned some
thing about one of the initiation tradi
tions for our sorority. To my surprise,
this was met with a quick shushing
and comment from my sister about
how that tradition is "sacred" and
should not be spoken of in front of
our third friend a reaction that
served to remind me just how differ
ent our lives in the same sorority are.
Stanford Greek life is unique
from that at other schools. And it
should be. In a place where some
manifestation of a "work hard, play
hard" motto seems to be the mantra
for many, the Greek system fits into
an existing, diverse and multifaceted
social and academic culture, rather
than the other way around. I have
found that Greek life is one piece in
the social puzzle. But, like everything
else, it isn't perfect and the decision
to join shouldn't be made flippantly.
Above all else, I value my experi
ence in the Greek system for the com
munity it has provided me. It's kind of
a strange concept Bid Day hits and
all of a sudden you have 120 people
who supposedly have your back just
because of a label, but you've never
met a large portion of them. At the
same time, it set a tone, and that kind
of enthusiasm and investment (even if
initially obligatory) made the ensuing
community with those 120 girls
stronger in my case.

To be clear, that isn't to say I'm
best friends with everyone; it just
means I know everyone cares about
me. It means that when I've gotten a
bad midterm score back, or some
thing is going on at home, I can walk
down to our lounge and can trust
whoever is there to support me. In
the face of a sophomore year that has
been far more slump-y than I could
have ever imagined, being a part of a
group and, in my case, in a house such
as this, has made all the difference in
my own well-being.
For me, rushing was about find
ing a group of people who I not only
got along with, but who would help
me make the most of my Stanford ex
perience and inspire my own personal
growth. It would be a vast oversimpli
fication to say that any individual in
any chapter is exactly "like" every oth
er member one reason why sorori
ty stereotypes serve no real purpose.
After all, in any group of such a size,
there are bound to be a variety of per
spectives and experiences. I had nev
er met most of the people in my soror
ity or even my pledge class before I
joined, and being exposed to these
perspectives and getting to know
those who hold them has changed the
way I view my own life and this ex
tends outside of my particular Greek
organization as well. Greek life has re
minded me just how amazing the stu
dents of Stanford are because it has al
lowed me to meet so many other peo
ple in different chapters, each of
whom has their own story to share.
So yes, I'm glad I rushed and I do
