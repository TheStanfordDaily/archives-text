## Op-Ed Rush, Sororities and the Stanford Social Puzzle 
### Amanda Brockbank 
When I was home for spring
break, I was sitting around
with two of my closest
friends, one of whom is in the same
sorority as I am at Colorado, and the
other who is not involved in Greek life
at all at her small liberal arts school.
Offhand, I jokingly mentioned some
thing about one of the initiation tradi
tions for our sorority. To my surprise,
this was met with a quick shushing
and comment from my sister about
how that tradition is "sacred" and
should not be spoken of in front of
our third friend a reaction that
served to remind me just how differ
ent our lives in the same sorority are.
Stanford Greek life is unique
from that at other schools. And it
should be. In a place where some
manifestation of a "work hard, play
hard" motto seems to be the mantra
for many, the Greek system fits into
an existing, diverse and multifaceted
social and academic culture, rather
than the other way around. I have
found that Greek life is one piece in
the social puzzle. But, like everything
else, it isn't perfect and the decision
to join shouldn't be made flippantly.
Above all else, I value my experi
ence in the Greek system for the com
munity it has provided me. It's kind of
a strange concept Bid Day hits and
all of a sudden you have 120 people
who supposedly have your back just
because of a label, but you've never
met a large portion of them. At the
same time, it set a tone, and that kind
of enthusiasm and investment (even if
initially obligatory) made the ensuing
community with those 120 girls
stronger in my case.

To be clear, that isn't to say I'm
best friends with everyone; it just
means I know everyone cares about
me. It means that when I've gotten a
bad midterm score back, or some
thing is going on at home, I can walk
down to our lounge and can trust
whoever is there to support me. In
the face of a sophomore year that has
been far more slump-y than I could
have ever imagined, being a part of a
group and, in my case, in a house such
as this, has made all the difference in
my own well-being.
For me, rushing was about find
ing a group of people who I not only
got along with, but who would help
me make the most of my Stanford ex
perience and inspire my own personal
growth. It would be a vast oversimpli
fication to say that any individual in
any chapter is exactly "like" every oth
er member one reason why sorori
ty stereotypes serve no real purpose.
After all, in any group of such a size,
there are bound to be a variety of per
spectives and experiences. I had nev
er met most of the people in my soror
ity or even my pledge class before I
joined, and being exposed to these
perspectives and getting to know
those who hold them has changed the
way I view my own life and this ex
tends outside of my particular Greek
organization as well. Greek life has re
minded me just how amazing the stu
dents of Stanford are because it has al
lowed me to meet so many other peo
ple in different chapters, each of
whom has their own story to share.
So yes, I'm glad I rushed and I do
love being in Greek life, but to be
perfectly honest, all of these things
I've come to love about it can be
found in a lot of places. There are
a million communities on campus,
and everyone has a niche. I also
happened to get very lucky in my
rush experience, and I know that
it isn't all sunshine and rainbows
and new perspectives. Perhaps be
cause rush is somewhat exclusive
and based on relatively arbitrary

terms (as opposed to other exclu
sive groups on campus that are
based on specific qualities for a
job, such as tour guiding, RAing or
Camp Kesem), there are far too
many questions of self-worth that
arise from the process. That feel
ing also leads to some of the com
mon impressions and stereotypes
that are thrown around today.

I walked into rush sure that I

would drop the sorority that I end
ed up joining on the first night,
based solely on the stereotypes I
heard beforehand. And it is for
that reason that I encourage peo
ple to rush if they're even just
thinking about it. I happened to
find a community that was right
for me, one that I never would
have found if I hadn't gone
through the full rush experience
and had gone just based on what I
heard, and I think that's true for
many people. Rush is also kind of
fun it's your job just to talk to
people.

But at the same time, it's easy
to forget along the way that only
15 percent of Stanford students
are involved in the Greek system.
Stanford is not a Southern school
and Greek life is not the be-all
end-all. It's one piece. One evolv
ing piece in a massive, diverse and
ever-changing puzzle.

else, it isn't perfect and the decision
to join shouldn't be made flippantly.
Above all else, I value my experi
ence in the Greek system for the com
munity it has provided me. It's kind of
a strange concept Bid Day hits and
all of a sudden you have 120 people
who supposedly have your back just
because of a label, but you've never
met a large portion of them. At the
same time, it set a tone, and that kind
of enthusiasm and investment (even if
initially obligatory) made the ensuing
community with those 120 girls
stronger in my case.

To be clear, that isn't to say I'm
best friends with everyone; it just
means I know everyone cares about
me. It means that when I've gotten a
bad midterm score back, or some
thing is going on at home, I can walk
down to our lounge and can trust
whoever is there to support me. In
the face of a sophomore year that has
been far more slump-y than I could
have ever imagined, being a part of a
group and, in my case, in a house such
as this, has made all the difference in
my own well-being.
For me, rushing was about find
ing a group of people who I not only
got along with, but who would help
me make the most of my Stanford ex
perience and inspire my own personal
growth. It would be a vast oversimpli
fication to say that any individual in
any chapter is exactly "like" every oth
er member one reason why sorori
ty stereotypes serve no real purpose.
After all, in any group of such a size,
there are bound to be a variety of per
spectives and experiences. I had nev
er met most of the people in my soror
ity or even my pledge class before I
joined, and being exposed to these
perspectives and getting to know
those who hold them has changed the
way I view my own life and this ex
tends outside of my particular Greek
organization as well. Greek life has re
minded me just how amazing the stu
dents of Stanford are because it has al
lowed me to meet so many other peo
ple in different chapters, each of
whom has their own story to share.
So yes, I'm glad I rushed and I do
love being in Greek life, but to be
perfectly honest, all of these things
I've come to love about it can be
found in a lot of places. There are
a million communities on campus,
and everyone has a niche. I also
happened to get very lucky in my
rush experience, and I know that
it isn't all sunshine and rainbows
and new perspectives. Perhaps be
cause rush is somewhat exclusive
and based on relatively arbitrary

terms (as opposed to other exclu
sive groups on campus that are
based on specific qualities for a
job, such as tour guiding, RAing or
Camp Kesem), there are far too
many questions of self-worth that
arise from the process. That feel
ing also leads to some of the com
mon impressions and stereotypes
that are thrown around today.

I walked into rush sure that I

would drop the sorority that I end
ed up joining on the first night,
based solely on the stereotypes I
heard beforehand. And it is for
that reason that I encourage peo
ple to rush if they're even just
thinking about it. I happened to
find a community that was right
for me, one that I never would
have found if I hadn't gone
through the full rush experience
and had gone just based on what I
heard, and I think that's true for
many people. Rush is also kind of
fun it's your job just to talk to
people.

But at the same time, it's easy
to forget along the way that only
15 percent of Stanford students
are involved in the Greek system.
Stanford is not a Southern school
and Greek life is not the be-all
end-all. It's one piece. One evolv
ing piece in a massive, diverse and
ever-changing puzzle.

When I was home for spring
break, I was sitting around
with two of my closest
friends, one of whom is in the same
sorority as I am at Colorado, and the
other who is not involved in Greek life
at all at her small liberal arts school.
Offhand, I jokingly mentioned some
thing about one of the initiation tradi
tions for our sorority. To my surprise,
this was met with a quick shushing
and comment from my sister about
how that tradition is "sacred" and
should not be spoken of in front of
our third friend a reaction that
served to remind me just how differ
ent our lives in the same sorority are.
Stanford Greek life is unique
from that at other schools. And it
should be. In a place where some
manifestation of a "work hard, play
hard" motto seems to be the mantra
for many, the Greek system fits into
an existing, diverse and multifaceted
social and academic culture, rather
than the other way around. I have
found that Greek life is one piece in
the social puzzle. But, like everything
else, it isn't perfect and the decision
to join shouldn't be made flippantly.
