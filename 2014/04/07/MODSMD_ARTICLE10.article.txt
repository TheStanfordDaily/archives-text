# WEAK OFFENSE DOOMS CARD

### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
In perhaps its toughest road trip
of the year, Stanford's baseball team
was swept in Corvallis, Ore., this
weekend by No. 6 Oregon State (25-
6, 9-3 Pac-12) in three tight games
dominated by pitching. With the
sweep, the Beavers extended then'
winning streak against the Cardinal
(10-14, 3-6) to an all-time high eight
games dating back three seasons, as
they won by scores of 4-1,1-0 (13 in
nings) and 2-1.

4/6, Corvallis, Ore.
The Stanford pitching staff held
the Beavers to just seven runs and a
.204 batting average over the three
game series, particularly notable
considering Oregon State's 6.7 runs
per game average this season.
Freshman Cal Quantrill contin
ued to dominate in his start on Sat
urday, allowing just five baserun
ners and striking out six over eight
shutout innings. He has settled in
as the season has progressed, in
which each subsequent start has
seemed to top the previous one.
Over his last six starts, Quantrill
has a 0.70 ERA (three earned runs
over 38.1 innings) and a 0.68 WHII)
lowering his season ERA to 2.60.
Stanford's bullpen also excelled
in Corvallis, allowing no earned
runs over a combined 14.1 innings.
Junior John Hochstatter had the
team's strongest outing of the
weekend, coming in on Sunday for
freshman starter Chris Viall in the
second inning and finishing the
game with 6.2 scoreless innings.
Yet one of the key stories of the
weekend was the ineffectiveness of
Stanford's offense, as the Oregon
State staffâ€”ranked 10th national
ly with a 2.28 ERA entering this
weekend outpitched the Cardi
nal, allowing just two total runs
over the three games.

"We need to score some runs.
We've been inept with the bat the
last three weeks, even the games
we won," said head coach Mark
Marquess. "Offensively, we have to
pick it up."
Although the Cardinal actually
outhit their opponents .211 to .204
over the three games, they still
weren't able to score runners once
they got on base an issue for the
team that has appeared throughout
the season, as they have averaged
eight runners left on base per game
this season through the Oregon
State series. Stanford hit just .105

(2-for-19) with runners in scoring
position and left a total of 27 run
ners on base over the weekend.

On Friday, both teams got off to
strong starts, each loading the
bases in a 25-minute first inning.
Yet in a microcosm of the series,
Stanford stranded all three runners
after an infield fly and a flyout from
the heart of the order, while Oregon
State pushed a run across with a
bases-loaded walk.
Freshman Brett Hanewich got
the start on Friday but had a shaky
outing, lasting 5.2 innings and al
lowing a season-high four runs.

Oregon State's ace, senior south
paw Ben Wetzler, who entered Fri
day's game with a 5-0 record and a
0.47 ERA this season, dominated
Cardinal hitters from start to finish.
He allowed just one run none
earned on four hits over nine in
nings for his first complete game of
the year.
After the Cardinal plated an un
earned run on a single from sopho
more catcher Wayne Taylor in the
second inning, Stanford's best
chance to score came in the sev-

enth, as consecutive two-out
singles once again brought
Taylor to the plate. He flew
out to right field to end the
inning, and Wetzler cruised
for the rest of the game.
Saturday's pitching
matchup was most favorable
for the Cardinal, as they
faced the Beavers' lone
right-handed starter, sopho
more Andrew Moore, while
sending the rolling Quantrill
to the mound.
While the Stanford of
fense had eight hits off
Moore in the game's first sev
en innings, they were not
able to come through with
men in scoring position. The
team was 0-for-10 with those
situations and it left 13 men
on base in the game. The
Cardinal hit into three rally
killing double plays on Satur
day, and six total in the series.
Senior A.J. Vanegas
came on to relieve Quantrill
in the eighth inning with the
game still scoreless, and he
pitched a strong four innings
out of the bullpen, allowing

just four base runners over
all. But in the bottom of the
13th, the Beavers' freshman
shortstop Trever Morrison
singled through the left side
to lead off the inning and
then advanced on a passed
ball and a sacrifice bunt. Ore
gon State walked off on a
game-winning single by the
next hitter, taking the game
1-0.
After Stanford's offensive
struggles on Saturday, which
included not having a hit in
extra innings, Marquess hit
junior Alex Blandino in the
leadoff spot for the first time
in his career in an effort to
shake up the lineup.
"Just to change it up a lit
tle bit. We hadn't had much
production the way we had
[the order]," Marquess said
of the change. "But it didn't
produce anything."

Freshman Chris Viall
lasted just 1.1 innings for the
second consecutive start, this
time allowing two runs on
three hits and two walks be
fore getting the early hook.
While Hochstatter came in
and shut out the Beavers for
the rest of the game, the Car
dinal hitters were able to
plate just one run coming
on three consecutive singles

in the third inning.
While pitching and de
fense have been strong suits
for Stanford as of late, the
team will look to get its of
fense going as it returns
home for a local matchup
against UC-Davis at Sunken
Diamond on Tuesday at 5:30
p.m. followed by a road trip
to Washington this weekend.
