# STREAKS SNAPPED
## 
### FIONA NOONAN STAFF WRITER 
It was a tough weekend for
Stanford tennis, as both the men's
and women's teams faced USC
and UCLA, and in the course of
doing so, the men saw their six
match winning streak snapped and
the women lost for the first time
since before last year's NCAA
championship run.

For the No. 52 Stanford men (9-
4,2-2 Pac-12), the trouble began on
Friday against No. 2 USC (21-2,3-
0 Pac-12) in Los Angeles, where
they were swept 7-0 at Marks Sta
dium.
The doubles point narrowly
went to USC, after the Trojans
took the matches on courts two
and three, 8-7 (7) and 8-6, respec
tively. And though junior John
Morrissey put up a good fight
against USC's 12th-ranked Yan
nick Hanfmann, the Card ulti
mately lost all six singles matches
in straight sets.
The weekend only worsened
from there as Stanford faced No. 3
UCLA (17-2, 4-0 Pac-12) on Satur
day afternoon, losing 4-0 in West
wood. After taking the doubles

point with two 8-4 victories, the
Brains picked up three more sin
gles points to claim the overall dual
match.

On court two, No. 1 Clay
Thompson delivered a loss to Stan
ford senior Daniel Ho, and the
match wrapped up as Stanford
sophomores Nolan Paige and An
thony Tsodikov fell in straight sets
on courts four and five, respectively.
The two losses in Southern Cal
ifornia mark the first time all sea
son that the men's squad has lost
consecutive matches. With just
three conference matches remain
ing this season, the Cardinal will
look to rebuild some momentum in
advance of the Pac-12 Tournament.
For the No. 4 Stanford women
(14-1, 6-1 Pac-12), this critical
weekend got off to a rocky start on
Friday afternoon at the Taube
Family Tennis Stadium, where No.
3 UCLA (18-2, 6-1 Pac-12) handed
the squad its first loss of the sea
son. Coming into the game, Stan
ford was the only remaining unde
feated team in the country.
For the first time this season,
the Cardinal lost the doubles point
to start the match, despite the No.
10 duo of senior Kristie Ahn and
freshman Carol Zhao downing
UCLAs No. 1 Robin Anderson
and Jennifer Brady on the number
one court.

From there, it was a battle all
the way. No. 37 freshman Caroline

Doyle and classmate No. 28 Zhao
both picked up singles wins to put
Stanford ahead 2-1. But the Bruins
answered with wins over No. 27
freshman Taylor Davidson on
court four and No. 2 Ahn on court
one only Ahn's third loss of the
season.

When junior No. 42 Ellen Tsay
beat UCLAs No. 55 Catherine
Harrison on court five the match
looked within reach, but the Bru
ins' No. 16 Jennifer Brady edged
Stanford's No. 39 sophomore
Krista Hardebeck 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 to
eke out the team victory.
The Card's fortunes improved
on Saturday, however, when they
bested No. 12 USC (14-6, 5-2 Pac
-12) at home 4-0. Stanford went up
1-0 with the doubles point, then
proceeded to get wins from Zhao,
Doyle and finally Ahn to reach the
required four points to take the
match. Ahn leads the team with 25
victories this season, while Zhao
has won 14 in a row and Doyle is on
a 12-match winning streak.
Despite suffering their first
loss of the season, the women are
still in perfect playoff position with
just three matches remaining in
the regular season. Across the Bay,
No. 13 Cal (14-4, 7-0 Pac-12) took
down both UCLA and USC this
weekend, vaulting the Bears into
the Pac-12's top spot with seven

Stanford certainly felt the impact of senior Kristie Ahn's (above) third singles loss of season in their eventual
loss to UCLA. The team and Ahn bounced back well, however, sweeping USC a few days later.
