# FOOTBALL NOTES
## Offense prevails in battles 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
After practicing through the
rain during the previous week, the
Cardinal football team was finally
blessed with clear, warm weather
for Saturday's open practice to
kick off the week leading up to the
Cardinal and White Spring Game.
With the sun came a chance for the
offense to redeem itself after be
ing dominated by the defense on
Thursday, and redeem itself it did
behind the arm of freshman quar
terback Ryan Burns and the
steadfast downfield running of
junior running back Kelsey Young.
"That's what you want in the
spring," said head coach David
Shaw. "You want one side doing re
ally, really well, then you want the
other side battling back. It shows
the guys have some fight in them,
and it was nice to see the offense
come back today."
Admittedly, with the rain hav
ing been a significant factor in the
previous week's practices, the 8-2
victory in the short-yardage drills
for the defense on Thursday was
likely to be expected with the slick
ball and wet, slippery ground. On
Saturday, however, with regular
backup quarterback Evan Crower
out with a deviated septum, Burns
was given the opportunity to take
the reins of the offense after hav
ing been suspended for the first
session of spring practices.
With starting quarterback
Kevin Hogan having some accura
cy issues during the short-yardage
drills, Burns was solid in his first
action in front of an audience this
spring, helping lead the offense to
a 4-2 victory with some impressive
passes into tight spaces to keep
the chains moving after having
had a disappointing practice to
open the spring session. However,
Shaw characterized Burns' per
formance on Saturday to be mere
ly "functional" and mentioned that
there were still steps that the
young pocket-passer needed to
take in order to become a "service
able quarterback" moving for
ward.
"The biggest overall goal [for
Burns] is to be efficient," Shaw
