# FOOTBALL NOTES
## Offense prevails in battles 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
After practicing through the
rain during the previous week, the
Cardinal football team was finally
blessed with clear, warm weather
for Saturday's open practice to
kick off the week leading up to the
Cardinal and White Spring Game.
With the sun came a chance for the
offense to redeem itself after be
ing dominated by the defense on
Thursday, and redeem itself it did
behind the arm of freshman quar
terback Ryan Burns and the
steadfast downfield running of
junior running back Kelsey Young.
"That's what you want in the
spring," said head coach David
Shaw. "You want one side doing re
ally, really well, then you want the
other side battling back. It shows
the guys have some fight in them,
and it was nice to see the offense
come back today."
Admittedly, with the rain hav
ing been a significant factor in the
previous week's practices, the 8-2
victory in the short-yardage drills
for the defense on Thursday was
likely to be expected with the slick
ball and wet, slippery ground. On
Saturday, however, with regular
backup quarterback Evan Crower
out with a deviated septum, Burns
was given the opportunity to take
the reins of the offense after hav
ing been suspended for the first
session of spring practices.
With starting quarterback
Kevin Hogan having some accura
cy issues during the short-yardage
drills, Burns was solid in his first
action in front of an audience this
spring, helping lead the offense to
a 4-2 victory with some impressive
passes into tight spaces to keep
the chains moving after having
had a disappointing practice to
open the spring session. However,
Shaw characterized Burns' per
formance on Saturday to be mere
ly "functional" and mentioned that
there were still steps that the
young pocket-passer needed to
take in order to become a "service
able quarterback" moving for
ward.
"The biggest overall goal [for
Burns] is to be efficient," Shaw
said. "You can't miss an au
dible, you can't miss a run
check, you can't miss a read.
Forget about knowing
everything. We don't need
him to know everything. We
just need him to be effi
cient."
Burns and Hogan got
some help on the receiving
end from freshman wide re
ceiver Francis Owusu, who
was fantastic in picking up
yards after the catch as he
showcased his physical play
and his speed.
In addition, Young
showed himself to be adjust
ing to becoming a downhill
runner very well after he
spent last season predomi

nantly taking end-arounds
as part of the "Wildcat" for
mation. On Saturday, Young
showed a great ability to
pick up yards after contact
while running up the middle
and consistently surged for
ward for seven or eight
yards at a time. With junior
Remound Wright sitting out
for the spring session due to
a disciplinary issue, Young
will look to receive more
carries through the remain
der of the spring and will be
competing with Wright,
along with Ricky Seale and
Barry J. Sanders, for the li
on's share of the carries
come the fall.
"You see [Young's] speed
and explosiveness he's
hard to tackle," Shaw said.
"In Francis Owusu, you're
talking about a guy that
runs like his brother [Chris
'l2] but is about three inch

es taller and is about 15
pounds heavier... he broke
some tackles today and he
can get up to speed. He's
hard to bring down, so those
are young guys who we're
looking to get more involved
in the offense."
Freshmen tight ends Er
ic Cotton, Austin Hooper
and Greg Taboada also con
tinued to take larger roles
moving forward and played
with the first-team offense
on Saturday, with junior
Charlie Hopkins moving on
to the second-team offense
for the drills to end practice
and catching a late touch
down pass from Burns.
The Cardinal and White
Spring Game will take place

Stanford Stadium at 1 p.m.

Burns and Hogan got
some help on the receiving
end from freshman wide re
ceiver Francis Owusu, who
was fantastic in picking up
yards after the catch as he
showcased his physical play
and his speed.
In addition, Young
showed himself to be adjust
ing to becoming a downhill
runner very well after he
spent last season predomi

nantly taking end-arounds
as part of the "Wildcat" for
mation. On Saturday, Young
showed a great ability to
pick up yards after contact
while running up the middle
and consistently surged for
ward for seven or eight
yards at a time. With junior
Remound Wright sitting out
for the spring session due to
a disciplinary issue, Young
will look to receive more
carries through the remain
der of the spring and will be
competing with Wright,
along with Ricky Seale and
Barry J. Sanders, for the li
on's share of the carries
come the fall.
"You see [Young's] speed
and explosiveness he's
hard to tackle," Shaw said.
"In Francis Owusu, you're
talking about a guy that
runs like his brother [Chris
'l2] but is about three inch

es taller and is about 15
pounds heavier... he broke
some tackles today and he
can get up to speed. He's
hard to bring down, so those
are young guys who we're
looking to get more involved
in the offense."
Freshmen tight ends Er
ic Cotton, Austin Hooper
and Greg Taboada also con
tinued to take larger roles
moving forward and played
with the first-team offense
on Saturday, with junior
Charlie Hopkins moving on
to the second-team offense
for the drills to end practice
and catching a late touch
down pass from Burns.
The Cardinal and White
Spring Game will take place
this coming Saturday at
Stanford Stadium at 1 p.m.
