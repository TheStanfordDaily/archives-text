# OPINIONS
## THE 						HUMANITIES IN THE 21ST CENTURY April 7-11, 2014 FROM THE OPINIONS DESK An introduction to Op-Ed series 
### Winston Shi 
I will be the first person to admit
that I don't know everything.

I am reminded of that fact every
day. There is a lot going on here, and
while I'm interested in learning
more, I also acknowledge that there
is only so much I can learn and so
much that I can successfully process.
And isn't that why we have an
Opinions Section?
Allow me to explain. The Section
exists in order to showcase discourse
and debate. Winning debates is
about crafting arguments and prov
ing others invalid, to be sure, but ul
timately persuasion is the art of
showing people a perspective they
had never before understood. What
we do at Opinions is teach people
about issues and views that had not
been explained before.
In the pursuit of this ideal, we
want to have a columnist staff that
accurately reflects the Stanford pop
ulation. We have increased the num
ber of columnists at The Daily be
cause we want to bring in more per
spectives and more debate. And the
breadth of our scope has increased in
this respect. But the volume of
columns at The Daily is not the only
thing that matters to the life of the
mind at Stanford. We would be serv
ing you little if we provided you with
breadth without depth or explana
tions without nuance.

At the same time, it's critical to
better use the community that we
have here. For all the talk about
fundraising or reputation, the most
valuable resource we have here is
our minds. I argued in my opening
column for Opinions that what we
need is more community involve
ment in one of our most important
institutions.

It is regrettable, then, that there
is always a strong human tendency
towards inactivity. We solicit op-eds,
that is true. We recruit columnists
and we always welcome letters to the
editor. But opinions sections are fun
damentally reactive. Our columnists
respond to events. Our op-eds come
in because somebody decided that
something was so important that
they wanted to write about it. But it
is obvious that people have opinions
even when the time does not directly
call themselves to speak out, and is
sues still command the imagination
when they are not the first thing on
our minds. Inertia and the Stanford
bubble, then, go hand in hand. We
gravitate towards the world within
the University grounds, and our
minds are more comfortable focus
ing on what we can readily see.

Far more insidious, however, are

the issues we see but do not truly un
derstand.

I speak of the problems that we
give lip service to but never really
tackle. These are often the most crit
ical issues of the society we live in.
Often we as a community lack a fun
damental understanding of the prob
lems (and potentially non-problems)
that we face. Sometimes we don't
know what the solutions are.

We can attack these problems on
ly by making a sustained effort to un
derstand an issue. And we are trying
to begin by attacking these issues in
depth. We will bring administrators,
faculty and students to these pages
to explain what you need to know in
terms that are clear and with the nu
ance that these issues deserve.

The place to begin, I think, is the
humanities at Stanford. There is a
perpetual angst about the place and
role of the humanities here, and yet
nobody really knows what the actual
problem is or how to solve it. The fu
ture of the humanities is a question
that disturbs me and befuddles me
at the same time. Ordinarily I would
not worry too much about a debate
on the humanities, but the debate
seems to be turning into a question
of the very purpose of a rounded ed
ucation. That is certainly worth our
interest.

We have people who understand
the question. They don't all have the
same answers, but nevertheless they
can help you find the answer. At the
very least, I hope they will help get
the ball rolling.
We open this week's op-ed series
"The Humanities in the 21st
Century" with two very distin
guished thinkers: Dean Sailer of the
School of Humanities and Sciences
and Dean Minor of the School of
Medicine. As the week goes on, we
will feature op-eds from other
prominent members of the Stanford
community, both faculty and stu
dents, as we seek to learn more
about the future of the humanities at
Stanford. I welcome you as well, as
this is an inclusive project: If you
would like to contribute, we would
love to have you. Contributions from
the community are, after all, what
this series is about.

I would, like to thank Katie Mc-
Donough and, Natalie Jabbar at
the School of Humanities and
Sciences for their help and as
sistance in this project. I wish
them- and my readers the best of
luck.

derstand.

I speak of the problems that we
give lip service to but never really
tackle. These are often the most crit
ical issues of the society we live in.
Often we as a community lack a fun
damental understanding of the prob
lems (and potentially non-problems)
that we face. Sometimes we don't
know what the solutions are.

We can attack these problems on
ly by making a sustained effort to un
derstand an issue. And we are trying
to begin by attacking these issues in
depth. We will bring administrators,
faculty and students to these pages
to explain what you need to know in
terms that are clear and with the nu
ance that these issues deserve.

The place to begin, I think, is the
humanities at Stanford. There is a
perpetual angst about the place and
role of the humanities here, and yet
nobody really knows what the actual
problem is or how to solve it. The fu
ture of the humanities is a question
that disturbs me and befuddles me
at the same time. Ordinarily I would
not worry too much about a debate
on the humanities, but the debate
seems to be turning into a question
of the very purpose of a rounded ed
ucation. That is certainly worth our
interest.

We have people who understand
the question. They don't all have the
same answers, but nevertheless they
can help you find the answer. At the
very least, I hope they will help get
the ball rolling.
We open this week's op-ed series
"The Humanities in the 21st
Century" with two very distin
guished thinkers: Dean Sailer of the
School of Humanities and Sciences
and Dean Minor of the School of
Medicine. As the week goes on, we
will feature op-eds from other
prominent members of the Stanford
community, both faculty and stu
dents, as we seek to learn more
about the future of the humanities at
Stanford. I welcome you as well, as
this is an inclusive project: If you
would like to contribute, we would
love to have you. Contributions from
the community are, after all, what
this series is about.

I would, like to thank Katie Mc-
Donough and, Natalie Jabbar at
the School of Humanities and
Sciences for their help and as
sistance in this project. I wish
them- and my readers the best of
luck.

I will be the first person to admit
that I don't know everything.

I am reminded of that fact every
day. There is a lot going on here, and
while I'm interested in learning
more, I also acknowledge that there
is only so much I can learn and so
much that I can successfully process.
And isn't that why we have an
Opinions Section?
Allow me to explain. The Section
exists in order to showcase discourse
and debate. Winning debates is
about crafting arguments and prov
ing others invalid, to be sure, but ul
timately persuasion is the art of
showing people a perspective they
had never before understood. What
we do at Opinions is teach people
about issues and views that had not
been explained before.
In the pursuit of this ideal, we
want to have a columnist staff that
accurately reflects the Stanford pop
ulation. We have increased the num
ber of columnists at The Daily be
cause we want to bring in more per
spectives and more debate. And the
breadth of our scope has increased in
this respect. But the volume of
columns at The Daily is not the only
thing that matters to the life of the
mind at Stanford. We would be serv
ing you little if we provided you with
breadth without depth or explana
tions without nuance.

At the same time, it's critical to
better use the community that we
have here. For all the talk about
fundraising or reputation, the most
valuable resource we have here is
our minds. I argued in my opening
column for Opinions that what we
need is more community involve
ment in one of our most important
institutions.

It is regrettable, then, that there
is always a strong human tendency
towards inactivity. We solicit op-eds,
that is true. We recruit columnists
and we always welcome letters to the
editor. But opinions sections are fun
damentally reactive. Our columnists
respond to events. Our op-eds come
in because somebody decided that
something was so important that
they wanted to write about it. But it
is obvious that people have opinions
even when the time does not directly
call themselves to speak out, and is
sues still command the imagination
when they are not the first thing on
our minds. Inertia and the Stanford
bubble, then, go hand in hand. We
gravitate towards the world within
the University grounds, and our
minds are more comfortable focus
ing on what we can readily see.

the issues we see but do not truly un
