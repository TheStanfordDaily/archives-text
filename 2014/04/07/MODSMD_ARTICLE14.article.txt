Humanities and arts (H&A)
enrollments have declined
over the past decade at
Stanford and at our peer institu
tions. At Stanford, the decline in
course enrollments in H&A de
partments has totaled 10 percent
over 10 years, while the number of
majors has declined 28 percent. Do
these trends matter? Why?
The goal of a Stanford under
graduate education should be to
prepare our graduates for fulfilling
professional, civic and personal
lives. The humanities and arts are
essential to all three. For profes
sional (and especially managerial)
careers, reading great literature
enhances the imagination and de
velops a more sophisticated "theo
ry of mind" that improves inter
personal skills. Courses in litera
ture, history and philosophy hone
analytical and writing abilities,
which are sought out by medical,
law and business schools in their
admissions.

The humanities and arts have
utilitarian value, but the case for
them does not rest solely on con
siderations of career. They go right
to the heart of the value and mean
ing of our civic and personal lives.
It goes without saying that in
formed citizens need to know about
the historical roots of contempo
rary problems as well as the cul
tures, religions and history of oth
er societies. One's personal life
should be grounded in critical re

flections about what is worthwhile
and just a principle expressed
by Socrates, the founder of Euro
pean moral philosophy, in his dic
tum that "the unexamined life is
not worth living." The humanities
and arts have the potential not on
ly to make a person's life better in
a moral sense but also richer in
aesthetic dimensions, as the recent
opening of Bing Concert Hall has
vividly demonstrated.
What are the implications of
this brief justification of the hu
manities and arts for Stanford edu
cation? As a dean, I believe that
every Stanford undergraduate
should have a serious engagement
with the humanities and arts. To
my mind, this is a more important
aim than increasing the number of
majors. And I hope that the en
gagement will stimulate discussion
and exploration beyond the class
room about what it means to lead a
purposeful life, how to contribute
as a citizen and how to deepen
one's appreciation of beauty.
What practical measures can
the School of H&S take to achieve
these ends?

First, the departments and fac
ulty have been developing courses
of broad interest for non-majors. I
was heartened to note that five of
The Stanford Daily's "top ten pro
fessors" (Professors Wolff, Apple
baum, Nemerov, Campbell and To
bin) teach courses in the humani
ties and arts. Secondly, some of the

core humanities departments have
revamped their curricula to give
them a clearer structure. Thirdly,
in response to the shift in student
interest from departmental majors
to Interdepartmental Programs
within H&S, such as Human Biolo
gy, International Relations and Sci
ence, Technology, and Society, and
we are finding ways to fold more
humanities courses into these pop
ular programs. Three of the new
Faculty Fellows in Human Biology
teach literature or philosophy
courses on subjects such as near
death experiences and ethics
through the life cycle. The Interna
tional Relations program now of
fers a specialization in "internation
al history and culture." New pro
grams combining technical skills
with the humanities are under de
velopment (a possible minor in
digital humanities or joint majors
in Computer Science and Eng
lish).

Finally, while I resist the no
tion that a Stanford undergradu
ate education is primarily for vo
cational ends, I understand the
anxieties about careers after
graduation. It is important for stu
dents and their families to realize
that for the great majority of our
graduates the bachelor's degree
will not be the end of their educa
tion: Professional schools can pro
vide vocational credentials, and hu-
manities and arts majors are
invited to apply for Stanford
Graduate School of Busi
ness's Summer Institute for
General Management with
the possibility of financial aid
from the Office of the Presi
dent beginning in Summer

2014. It is simply a mistake
to believe that a humanities
major is a professional dead
end.
Let me close on a person
al note. I started college in
an engineering program and
was thriving, but then dis
covered a real passion for
Roman history by taking a
course to satisfy a distribu
tion requirement. My switch
of major to classical history
required starting Greek and

Latin the next year, followed
by doctoral work in Cam
bridge, England. The job
market for Ph.D.s in history
was grim in the late 19705,
but I persisted, and the re
ward has been a career in
teaching and research that
has been thoroughly engag
ing and enjoyable. The les
son I would draw is not that
all engineers ought to trans
fer to the humanities as I did
(the world would grind to a

halt if they did), but that stu
dents should explore a wide
range of courses to develop
multiple ways of thinking
and to find their personal
passion, which may turn up
in unexpected places.

Humanities and arts (H&A)
enrollments have declined
over the past decade at
Stanford and at our peer institu
tions. At Stanford, the decline in
course enrollments in H&A de
partments has totaled 10 percent
over 10 years, while the number of
majors has declined 28 percent. Do
these trends matter? Why?
The goal of a Stanford under
graduate education should be to
prepare our graduates for fulfilling
professional, civic and personal
lives. The humanities and arts are
essential to all three. For profes
sional (and especially managerial)
careers, reading great literature
enhances the imagination and de
velops a more sophisticated "theo
ry of mind" that improves inter
personal skills. Courses in litera
ture, history and philosophy hone
analytical and writing abilities,
which are sought out by medical,
law and business schools in their
admissions.

The humanities and arts have
utilitarian value, but the case for
them does not rest solely on con
siderations of career. They go right
to the heart of the value and mean
ing of our civic and personal lives.
It goes without saying that in
formed citizens need to know about
the historical roots of contempo
rary problems as well as the cul
tures, religions and history of oth
er societies. One's personal life
should be grounded in critical re

flections about what is worthwhile
and just a principle expressed
by Socrates, the founder of Euro
pean moral philosophy, in his dic
tum that "the unexamined life is
not worth living." The humanities
and arts have the potential not on
ly to make a person's life better in
a moral sense but also richer in
aesthetic dimensions, as the recent
opening of Bing Concert Hall has
vividly demonstrated.
What are the implications of
this brief justification of the hu
manities and arts for Stanford edu
cation? As a dean, I believe that
every Stanford undergraduate
should have a serious engagement
with the humanities and arts. To
my mind, this is a more important
aim than increasing the number of
majors. And I hope that the en
gagement will stimulate discussion
and exploration beyond the class
room about what it means to lead a
purposeful life, how to contribute
as a citizen and how to deepen
one's appreciation of beauty.
What practical measures can
the School of H&S take to achieve
these ends?

First, the departments and fac
ulty have been developing courses
of broad interest for non-majors. I
was heartened to note that five of
The Stanford Daily's "top ten pro
fessors" (Professors Wolff, Apple
baum, Nemerov, Campbell and To
bin) teach courses in the humani
ties and arts. Secondly, some of the

core humanities departments have
revamped their curricula to give
them a clearer structure. Thirdly,
in response to the shift in student
interest from departmental majors
to Interdepartmental Programs
within H&S, such as Human Biolo
gy, International Relations and Sci
ence, Technology, and Society, and
we are finding ways to fold more
humanities courses into these pop
ular programs. Three of the new
Faculty Fellows in Human Biology
teach literature or philosophy
courses on subjects such as near
death experiences and ethics
through the life cycle. The Interna
tional Relations program now of
fers a specialization in "internation
al history and culture." New pro
grams combining technical skills
with the humanities are under de
velopment (a possible minor in
digital humanities or joint majors
in Computer Science and Eng
lish).

Finally, while I resist the no
tion that a Stanford undergradu
ate education is primarily for vo
cational ends, I understand the
anxieties about careers after
graduation. It is important for stu
dents and their families to realize
that for the great majority of our
graduates the bachelor's degree
will not be the end of their educa
tion: Professional schools can pro
vide vocational credentials, and hu-
manities and arts majors are
invited to apply for Stanford
Graduate School of Busi
ness's Summer Institute for
General Management with
the possibility of financial aid
from the Office of the Presi
dent beginning in Summer

2014. It is simply a mistake
to believe that a humanities
major is a professional dead
end.
Let me close on a person
al note. I started college in
an engineering program and
was thriving, but then dis
covered a real passion for
Roman history by taking a
course to satisfy a distribu
tion requirement. My switch
of major to classical history
required starting Greek and

Latin the next year, followed
by doctoral work in Cam
bridge, England. The job
market for Ph.D.s in history
was grim in the late 19705,
but I persisted, and the re
ward has been a career in
teaching and research that
has been thoroughly engag
ing and enjoyable. The les
son I would draw is not that
all engineers ought to trans
fer to the humanities as I did
(the world would grind to a

halt if they did), but that stu
dents should explore a wide
range of courses to develop
multiple ways of thinking
and to find their personal
passion, which may turn up
in unexpected places.
