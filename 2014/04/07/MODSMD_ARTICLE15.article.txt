# The 						humanities and medicine

Education in the humanities is
important preparation for a
career in medicine. Under
stand why begins with an apprecia
tion of the critical role of the hu
manities in enabling each of us to
have a more meaningful, thought
ful and insightful life. Through the
study of disciplines such as history,
philosophy, religion, literature and
languages we have unique opportu
nities to see the world through the
eyes of others who have different
cultural, social and ethical back
grounds. In so doing, we gain a bet
ter appreciation of diversity and
ambiguity.
Examining differences in values
and reasoning enables us to reflect
thoughtfully on the normative
framework we have as individuals
and as members of a society. The
humanities challenge us to question
our assumptions, examine our be
liefs and develop new ways of think
ing about "conventional" wisdom.
This appreciation for other modes
of thought enables us to see com
plexity and uncertainty as key ele
ments in the process toward discov
ering new truths. When viewed in
this context, the journey we travel
becomes as important as the desti
nations we reach.
Education in the humanities also
provides us with unique and power
ful opportunities to hone our skills
of critical analysis and develop clar
ity of thought and expression. In
every pursuit and profession, the
expression of ideas is inextricably
linked to the formulation of ideas. It
is through written and spoken com
munication that we shape and re
fine our thoughts.
With this background, we can
now inquire as to which of these
reasons for studying the humanities
are important in preparing for a ca

reer in medicine. The unequivocal
answer is all of them. Their impor
tance is manifested both in biomed
ical science and the relationship
with and care provided to patients
by physicians.

We are in the midst of a biomed
ical revolution. Multiple scientific
disciplines are now focused on ques
tions and problems important to bi
ology and medicine. From genomics
to electronic medical records, mas
sive quantities of data about individ
uals and populations are now avail
able. To obtain meaningful informa
tion from these sources requires
new processes of analysis based
more upon inductive and statistical
methods than upon deductive and
hypothesis-testing approaches. The
nature of truth, the power of these
inferences and the actions we
should take based upon them are
subjects of active discussion among
scientists and philosophers alike.
These new challenges and op
portunities present a host of ethi
cal dilemmas concerning protec
tion of privacy, consideration of
treatment options when knowledge
of effects and outcomes is incom
plete and ways that risk factors
and potential interventions are dis
cussed. We can garner insight into
all of these challenging topics from
the humanities.

In addition to these questions
arising from the rapid expansion of
biomedical inquiry and discovery,
there are timeless issues concern
ing the relationship between care
givers and our patients. Scientific
advances have improved our ability
to prevent and to treat many condi
tions, but the list of maladies for
which scientifically based ap
proaches is either incomplete or in
adequate remains longer than the

list of those successfully ameliorat
ed by modern medicine.

Consider the child with autism
or the adult with Alzheimer's dis
ease. A physician can make a diag
nosis but cannot offer a cure or a
satisfying answer to the question
"why?" Even for conditions that we
can prevent or treat, patient behav
ior can significantly impact the suc
cess or failure of an intervention.
For the hypertensive patient, no
amount of prescribed medication
will impact the social factors that
may be inhibiting lifestyle modifi
cation. The specificity of scientific
interventions does not account for
the messiness of human life.

We as physicians heal best when
we listen to and communicate with
our patients and seek to under
stand the challenges they face in
their lives. The perspectives on ill
ness, emotions and the human con
dition we gain from literature, reli
gion and philosophy provide us
with important contexts for fulfill
ing these roles and responsibilities.
In the end, this may be the most
compelling reason why the human
ities are important preparation for
a career in medicine. Through the
humanities, physicians and scien
tists can gain a more complete view
of what it means to be human.
Across time and space, we have
turned to the humanities to find in
sight into age-old questions and to
live more meaningful and thought
ful lives. In this biomedical revolu
tion, we need the humanities now
more than ever.
