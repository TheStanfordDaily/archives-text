# From black and white to shades of grey: Reflecting on my activism at Stanford
## 
### Kristian Bailey 
I began senior year pretty jaded,
feeling like I had very little left
to learn at Stanford. I had spent
time in Cape Town, Detroit and
Palestine over the prior nine months
watching people who were directly
engaged in social movements, and
so I was eager to escape the over
manufactured Stanford bubble for
the real world. But the intervening
months have proved my self-as
suredness and cynicism very
wrong.

I spent all of last quarter teach
ing a class on theories and methods
of affecting social change with my
best friend, in preparation for an
Alternative Spring Break trip we
led looking at Black, Arab and
queer organizing as case studies for
doing our own justice-based work.
Some of the biggest lessons I
learned during ASB came from my
fellow participants. During one of
our nightly reflections, one friend
asked whether how he a white
student might ever contribute to
a place like minority-majority
Stockton, where we spent the day
visiting.
The answer our group came up
with that you can work across
identity and perceptions if you ap
proach a community with humility
recalled exactly my experience
in Detroit last summer. And I re
flected that while I was a black per
son entering a predominantly black
city, my skin color did not imply
that I was immediately accepted or
that I could identify with Detroi
ters' struggles. While not ignoring
the reality that I likely did have an

easier time integrating into the
community as a black person, the
privileges of my educational and so
cial background make me closer to
my white friend than not. Regard
less of background, we all share the
associations of our common denom
inator Stanford University.
Towards the end of our trip, we
sat with longtime East Palo Alto or
ganizer Bob Hoover and heard him
predict EPA's complete gentrifica
tion in four or five years, thanks to
the growth of companies like Face
book and Google and the predatory
speculation on low-cost housing in
the neighborhood. Regardless of
how we identify politically, all Stan
ford students should understand
how our university and the indus
try to which it's tied and into which
many of us will go is directly relat
ed to the continued injustice facing
people just down the road from us.
Debriefing our trip with faculty
at the end of the trip, one professor
recalled author Adam Mansbach's
response to a Ph.D. student's ques
tion during the Occupy Art class in
2012. The student had asked Adam
how she could shed the "contamina
tion" of her Stanford degree in or
der to continue engaging with the
communities she cared about.
Adam's response, "It's too fâ€”king
late!" feels especially resonant.
None of us can give back the experi
ences, advantages and complicity
we've gained as Stanford students,
even if we are disturbed by the
deeply unjust power dynamics that
