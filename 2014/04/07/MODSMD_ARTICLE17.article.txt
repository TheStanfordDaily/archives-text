# In defense of Turkish democracy
## 
### James Bradbury 
It's become a cliche to call
Prime Minister Recep
Tayyip Erdogan the
"most powerful" and "most
capable" Turkish leader
since the country's founder,
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. But
that is arguably an under
statement: Erdogan main
tained for a decade what, for
a multiparty democracy, is a
truly exceptional level of
control over Turkish politics,
even though his AK Party
never once obtained a ma
jority of the national popular
vote in the six elections since
his rise to power.
Erdogan's achievement
is all the more impressive
when placed in the context of
Turkey's political history. In
2002, he inherited a state ap
paratus dedicated to the
preservation of the secular
ist legacy of Kemal Ataturk
and the elimination of Islam
ic-tinged political forces like
the one Erdogan represent
ed. Only five years earlier, a
so-called "postmodern coup"
by the Kemalist military
leadership had brought
down the last prime minister
to attempt a shift away from
secularism.
Even beyond the histori
cal connection to the original
state that Ataturk built, this
Kemalist elite had another,
more recent source of legiti
macy, having led the brutal
and lengthy counterinsur
gency in southeastern
Turkey against Kurdish na
tionalists, especially the mil
itant and (formerly) Marxist
organization known as the
PKK. This campaign has
been so central to modern
Turkish political and mili
tary culture that after the
PKK's leader Abdullah
Ocalan was finally captured
by intelligence operatives in
Kenya in 1999, he was im
prisoned alone on an island
in the middle of the Sea of
Marmara under a guard of
over a thousand Turkish sol
diers.
But Erdogan and the
AKP were not alone in their
protracted fight against the
entrenched political-military
establishment: They enlist
ed the help of a complex non
governmental movement
with a closely allied ideology
and a stable of loyal cadres.
This so-called Hizmet move
ment is made up of followers
of the charismatic but mod
erate Sunni Muslim preach
er Fethullah Giilen, and, de
spite amounting to only two
or three percent of the coun
try's population, controls
much of the Turkish media
and a massive global net
work of charter schools.
The idea behind the Er
dogan-Giilen alliance was to
replace the old-guard Ke
malists who made up most of
the career staff of the Turk
ish police, judiciary and oth
er key bureaucratic organs
with trustworthy but not
overtly partisan Giilenists.
In return the Giilenist media

would provide full-throated
support for the AK Party.
After all, Giilen himself —
exiled since 1999 to a private
compound in rural Pennsyl
vania— had no interest in
competing politically with
Erdogan or forming a party
of his own.
That was the status quo
until less than a year ago.
But last weekend, when
Turkey held municipal elec
tions, the political climate
could not have been more
different. After a year and a
half of hidden tensions, the
AKP and Hizmet split pub
licly in December, with
Giilenist prosecutors and
media announcing corrup
tion investigations into sen
ior AKP officials and mem
bers of Erdogan's family. In
response, Erdogan doubled
down, eventually announc
ing that he would seek
Hizmet's "eradication."
The recent local elections
were a referendum on Erdo
gan's rule, and he has taken
the AKP's victory as a signal
that his comrades have been
acquitted of the Giilenist
corruption charges "at the
ballot box." That is less un
reasonable than it might
sound; Erdogan's famously
micro-managerial governing
style means he can legiti
mately be held directly re
sponsible for everything
from the growth rate of the
Turkish economy to the (al
legedly politically motivat
ed) shooting down of a Syri
an warplane in the week be
fore the elections. And the
corruption allegations? It
certainly wasn't Erdogan
who made a jury of the Turk
ish electorate by leaking
wiretap after wiretap; the
charges and evidence were
debated in public because
the Giilenists made them
public.
The election results in
particular, the relatively
poor performance of the Ke
malist opposition only
serve to confirm the new
landscape of Turkish politi
cal power: a landscape com
posed of three people and
the three organizations they
control. The AKP under Er
dogan, the PKK under
Ocalan (who still wields im
mense authority from
prison) and the Hizmet un
der Giilen all represent well
organized movements with
charismatic and forward
thinking leaders and, most
importantly, fresh ideolo
gies, each of which in their
own way mark a break with
the seemingly tired Western
political discourse.
But of these three princi
pal power centers in contem
porary Turkey, only one
seeks, obtains and trumpets
electoral legitimacy. Only
one has the direct mass en
gagement that is essential to
true republicanism and
which Thaksin Shinawatra,
leading the most powerful
political party in Thailand

from Dubai, has proven is
possible to obtain even in ex
ile. In short, in the after
math of the vote, only one
faction actually represents a
plurality of the Turkish peo
ple.

And so while Ocalan's
deeply articulated libertari
an socialism and Giilen's vi
sion of Muslim-Jewish rec
onciliation are political
ideals I would give anything
to see realized, and despite
being personally haunted by
resemblances between Er
dogan and authoritarian
leaders of the past and pres
ent, I must still break with
the bulk of Western com
mentators and stand firmly
with the AKE
It is easy to criticize Er
dogan's paranoid leadership
style his latest move is to
assert that Hizmet is con
trolled by the CIA and
his constant announcement
of blanket bans on every
thing from late-night alcohol
sales to Twitter access. But
as with the fallen Muslim
Brotherhood government in
Egypt, cries of "autocracy"
are understandable but mis
guided. Turkey's press and
social media remain some of
the most vibrant and incisive
in the world, while even the
hated Ocalan can publish his
views from prison, and I am
confident that the day the
AKP begins to actively re
press their political opposi
tion is the day their empire
will begin to crumble.
In Afghanistan, an Erdo
gan-like era of strong and in
dependent personal leader
ship is coming to an end this
spring because the country
lacks the means to actually
pursue Erdogan-like inde
pendence in the political,
military or economic
spheres. As President
Hamid Karzai's effort to do
so anyway has resulted in
the country finding itself in
creasingly alienated from
the patrons it depends on to
support basic state and mili
tary institutions, every sin
gle credible presidential
candidate in Saturday's elec
tion bent over backwards to
show that their leadership
would be less "unpre
dictable" and (to put it blunt
ly) more beholden to foreign
powers than Karzai's.
On the other hand,
through its far better eco
nomic position, Turkey con
tinues to have the opportuni
ty to pioneer a new demo
cratic politics a politics
characterized by a strong
ruling party, a strong and
public leader and a strong
opposition that can claim the
moral high ground when
necessary. Last weekend
Recep Tayyip Erdogan won
the fight of his political life,
and the man who was once

"most powerful" and "most
capable" Turkish leader
since the country's founder,
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. But
that is arguably an under
statement: Erdogan main
tained for a decade what, for
a multiparty democracy, is a
truly exceptional level of
control over Turkish politics,
even though his AK Party
never once obtained a ma
jority of the national popular
vote in the six elections since
his rise to power.
Erdogan's achievement
is all the more impressive
when placed in the context of
Turkey's political history. In
2002, he inherited a state ap
paratus dedicated to the
preservation of the secular
ist legacy of Kemal Ataturk
and the elimination of Islam
ic-tinged political forces like
the one Erdogan represent
ed. Only five years earlier, a
so-called "postmodern coup"
by the Kemalist military
leadership had brought
down the last prime minister
to attempt a shift away from
secularism.
Even beyond the histori
cal connection to the original
state that Ataturk built, this
Kemalist elite had another,
more recent source of legiti
macy, having led the brutal
and lengthy counterinsur
gency in southeastern
Turkey against Kurdish na
tionalists, especially the mil
itant and (formerly) Marxist
organization known as the
PKK. This campaign has
been so central to modern
Turkish political and mili
tary culture that after the
PKK's leader Abdullah
Ocalan was finally captured
by intelligence operatives in
Kenya in 1999, he was im
prisoned alone on an island
in the middle of the Sea of
Marmara under a guard of
over a thousand Turkish sol
diers.
But Erdogan and the
AKP were not alone in their
protracted fight against the
entrenched political-military
establishment: They enlist
ed the help of a complex non
governmental movement
with a closely allied ideology
and a stable of loyal cadres.
This so-called Hizmet move
ment is made up of followers
of the charismatic but mod
erate Sunni Muslim preach
er Fethullah Giilen, and, de
spite amounting to only two
or three percent of the coun
try's population, controls
much of the Turkish media
and a massive global net
work of charter schools.
The idea behind the Er
dogan-Giilen alliance was to
replace the old-guard Ke
malists who made up most of
the career staff of the Turk
ish police, judiciary and oth
er key bureaucratic organs
with trustworthy but not
overtly partisan Giilenists.
In return the Giilenist media

would provide full-throated
support for the AK Party.
After all, Giilen himself —
exiled since 1999 to a private
compound in rural Pennsyl
vania— had no interest in
competing politically with
Erdogan or forming a party
of his own.
That was the status quo
until less than a year ago.
But last weekend, when
Turkey held municipal elec
tions, the political climate
could not have been more
different. After a year and a
half of hidden tensions, the
AKP and Hizmet split pub
licly in December, with
Giilenist prosecutors and
media announcing corrup
tion investigations into sen
ior AKP officials and mem
bers of Erdogan's family. In
response, Erdogan doubled
down, eventually announc
ing that he would seek
Hizmet's "eradication."
The recent local elections
were a referendum on Erdo
gan's rule, and he has taken
the AKP's victory as a signal
that his comrades have been
acquitted of the Giilenist
corruption charges "at the
ballot box." That is less un
reasonable than it might
sound; Erdogan's famously
micro-managerial governing
style means he can legiti
mately be held directly re
sponsible for everything
from the growth rate of the
Turkish economy to the (al
legedly politically motivat
ed) shooting down of a Syri
an warplane in the week be
fore the elections. And the
corruption allegations? It
certainly wasn't Erdogan
who made a jury of the Turk
ish electorate by leaking
wiretap after wiretap; the
charges and evidence were
debated in public because
the Giilenists made them
public.
The election results in
particular, the relatively
poor performance of the Ke
malist opposition only
serve to confirm the new
landscape of Turkish politi
cal power: a landscape com
posed of three people and
the three organizations they
control. The AKP under Er
dogan, the PKK under
Ocalan (who still wields im
mense authority from
prison) and the Hizmet un
der Giilen all represent well
organized movements with
charismatic and forward
thinking leaders and, most
importantly, fresh ideolo
gies, each of which in their
own way mark a break with
the seemingly tired Western
political discourse.
But of these three princi
pal power centers in contem
porary Turkey, only one
seeks, obtains and trumpets
electoral legitimacy. Only
one has the direct mass en
gagement that is essential to
true republicanism and
which Thaksin Shinawatra,
leading the most powerful
political party in Thailand

from Dubai, has proven is
possible to obtain even in ex
ile. In short, in the after
math of the vote, only one
faction actually represents a
plurality of the Turkish peo
ple.

And so while Ocalan's
deeply articulated libertari
an socialism and Giilen's vi
sion of Muslim-Jewish rec
onciliation are political
ideals I would give anything
to see realized, and despite
being personally haunted by
resemblances between Er
dogan and authoritarian
leaders of the past and pres
ent, I must still break with
the bulk of Western com
mentators and stand firmly
with the AKE
It is easy to criticize Er
dogan's paranoid leadership
style his latest move is to
assert that Hizmet is con
trolled by the CIA and
his constant announcement
of blanket bans on every
thing from late-night alcohol
sales to Twitter access. But
as with the fallen Muslim
Brotherhood government in
Egypt, cries of "autocracy"
are understandable but mis
guided. Turkey's press and
social media remain some of
the most vibrant and incisive
in the world, while even the
hated Ocalan can publish his
views from prison, and I am
confident that the day the
AKP begins to actively re
press their political opposi
tion is the day their empire
will begin to crumble.
In Afghanistan, an Erdo
gan-like era of strong and in
dependent personal leader
ship is coming to an end this
spring because the country
lacks the means to actually
pursue Erdogan-like inde
pendence in the political,
military or economic
spheres. As President
Hamid Karzai's effort to do
so anyway has resulted in
the country finding itself in
creasingly alienated from
the patrons it depends on to
support basic state and mili
tary institutions, every sin
gle credible presidential
candidate in Saturday's elec
tion bent over backwards to
show that their leadership
would be less "unpre
dictable" and (to put it blunt
ly) more beholden to foreign
powers than Karzai's.
On the other hand,
through its far better eco
nomic position, Turkey con
tinues to have the opportuni
