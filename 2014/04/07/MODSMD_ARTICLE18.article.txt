# Senior Night a sucess for Stanford
## 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's volleyball earned a
berth in the MPSF Tournament this week
end on its Senior Night after winning its
ninth straight match. The No. 4 Cardinal
(18-7,15-7 MPSF) are now tied for third in
conference after sweeping Cal Baptist and
Pacific at home to close out its home
schedule. Not only has Stanford now
clinched its seventh straight appearance
in the MPSF Tournament, but it is proving
to the country that it should be one of the
teams to beat moving forward into the
postseason.

After struggling on the road and losing
some close matches during the beginning
of the season, Stanford has really gained
momentum and tremendous confidence in
the second half of the campaign. After losing
all five of their matches that went into five
sets, the Card have seemed to figure out
how to keep opponents from pushing the
team into a final set. Stanford has come out
aggressively and swept away six of its last
nine opponents, demonstrating the ability
to dominate on offense and limit errors.
Friday night was truly indicative of that
encouraging trend. The Cardinal came out
with confidence and energy and began the
match with aggressive and well-communi
cated offense. Stanford jumped out to a 7-
1 lead over Cal Baptist and soon led 16-5,
going on to take the first set 25-13 with a
.417 hitting percentage.
The Cardinal were as much on a roll in

the second set as they were in the first,
leading 12-4 halfway through and winning
the frame 25-14. While the third set was
close at times and tied 10-10 at one point,
the Card were still poised and in control
throughout the set. They pulled through in
the end to win the match and notch their
13th sweep of the season.
Stanford had an excellent blocking
night, with multiple impressive blocking
plays. Stanford's defense was critical to its
dominant performance, holding the
Lancers to a .038 average for the first two
sets. Overall, the night was a full team ef
fort, with 11 different Cardinal players
taking the court throughout the match.
The seniors were at the center of the
energy on Senior Night and the Maples
crowd certainly added to the excitement.
Seniors Eric Mochalski, Steven Irvin,
Denny Falls, Brian Cook and Scott Sakai
da have all provided critical leadership for
the team throughout the season, and Cook
and Irvin have led the Cardinal this season
in kills per set.
Cook led the squad on Friday with eight
kills and five digs, while both Mochalski
and Irvin finished with four kills. Sakaida
also had his first start of the season and
recorded three digs for the night. The
match was in many ways a picture-perfect
Senior Night, with a complete effort led by
the seniors gaining a berth to the MPSF
Tournament for the Cardinal, which con
tinue to look as strong as ever entering the
postseason.
Stanford will take to the road for its fi
nal regular season matches this weekend,
playing UC-Irvine on Friday and UC-San
Diego on Saturday.

Senior opposite Eric Mochalski (above), one of five Stanford players to be honored
on the team's Senior Night, was a key cog in Stanford's offensive output against Cal
Baptist. The Card swept the Lancers on Friday to finish out its home schedule.
