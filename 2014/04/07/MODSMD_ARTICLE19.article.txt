# SPORTS BRIEF
## Williams leads strong Stanford showing at Stanford Invitational; Solomon wins third Australian national title 
### â€“ Do-Hyoung Park 
With over 3,300 athletes converging on
the Farm for the Stanford Invitational on Fri
day and Saturday, sophomore Kristyn
Williams led a fantastic Stanford showing by
posting a top-five national time in the 400 me-

ters as Cardinal athletes posted personal
bests all around the board.
Williams' time of 52.70 was the third
fastest time in school history in the 400 and
was fifth in the country up to this point be
hind four other times that all also occurred
over the weekend. Although Williams had a
time that would have been the fastest in the
nation before this past weekend, strong per
formances in the Florida Relays pushed the
standout sophomore behind in the opening
meets of the outdoor season.
Junior Brianna Bain contributed the
third-longest javelin throw in the nation with
her 180-foot-5-inch throw, which represented
the second-longest throw of her career and
won the event at the Invitational by nearly 19
feet.
In the distances, fifth-year senior Tyler
Stutzman ran a 3:42.45 in the 1500-meter
event the current fastest time in the coun
try as he pushed to a victory despite not
having had eligibility in the indoor season,
which preceded the start of this outdoor sea
son. Stutzman also set a new personal record
in the 800 on Saturday.
While the majority of Stanford's team
competed at the Stanford Invitational, soph
omore Steven Solomon was halfway around
the world in his home country of Australia
competing at the Australian Athletics Cham
pionships. With his time of 45.36 seconds in
the 400, Solomon won his third national title
and will again be in good position to be
named to the Australian national team.
