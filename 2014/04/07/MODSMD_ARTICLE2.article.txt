## Holston, Finley seek re-election Duo are first senators in three years to run for a second term 
### PETER MOON DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Two members of the 15th ASSU
Undergraduate Senate will seek re
election to a second term through
this year's spring ballot, making
them the first incumbent Senators
to do so in three years. The Daily
sat down with Senate Chair Ben
Holston 'l5 and Senator John-Lan
caster Finley 'l6 to discuss their
time in office and their plans for
their second term.
Holston
During his time leading the 15th
Undergraduate Senate, Holston
helped champion the SAFE Re
form proposal, a measure that aims
to simplify and improve the current
student activities funding system.
The bill will join Holston on this
year's ballot.
"[lf the bill passes] we will be in
stituting a new funding system,"
Holston said. "There will be tons of
work involved educating student
groups and funding system will
change pretty significantly."
Looking ahead to a prospective
second term, Holston said that he
hopes to employ his experi
ence in educating future
Senators and student group
leaders on the dynamics be
hind the measure and the de
tails of the new quick, minor
and major grant options
open for students.
"I know that leadership
[will be] required in enacting
SAFE Reform with the new
group of incoming sena
tors," Holston said as a rea
son for his decision to run
again.
Holston's campaign last
year was centered on help
ing student-athletes and re
solving student dining con
flicts as elicited by the
Suites controversy. While
the latter issue has since
been resolved, Holston a
former varsity swimmer
himself —said that helping
student-athletes will remain
a priority for him going for
ward.
"A huge part of what I
want to do [is] with athlet
ics," Holston said. "I want to
get them better class times
because practices often oc
cur during the [current]
times. A lot of these guys
have to come back for a fifth
year and pay tuition for an
other year because they
couldn't take some of those
classes because of travel
policies."
Holston also identified
improving academic depart
ment communication of class

issues and facilitating a more
unified ASSU as priorities.
With regards to the latter, he
expressed interest in devel
oping joint initiatives be
tween the Senate and the
ASSU Executive to improve
inter-departmental and insti
tutional communication.
"Ben and John-Lancast
er's re-election will encour
age a continuation of institu
tional knowledge," said Sena
tor Zane Hellmann 'l6. "In
stitutional knowledge is
quickly lost in the undergrad
uate career due to a one year
turnover and having two [vet
eran members] will help the
next senate. They are great
candidates, and I fully sup
port their reelection."
Deputy Chair Anna
Breed 'l6 also commented
on the importance of institu
tional knowledge.
"I am really excited that
both of them are re-run
ning," Breed said. "I think
the most important thing for
the ASSU in general and for
the
Undergraduate Senate is to
maintain institutional knowl
edge. Encouraging upper
classmen and returning sen
ators to run is what we

hoped to accomplish when
we lifted the going abroad
restriction."

Finley
Finley, who co-led the
Joint Legislative Committee
on Judicial Affairs and led
the Senate's Administration
and Rules Committee, is the
Senate's expert on the ASSU
Constitution and bylaws. Ac
cording to Finley, his particu
lar duties require a large
amount of institutional
knowledge and experience in
the ASSU.

"It took me about a quar
ter and a half to familiarize
myself with the Constitution
al bylaws and processes of
the Senate," Finley said.
This year, Finley's plat
form rests on upholding com
munity standards, reviewing
the method in which the stu
dents are appointed to Uni
versity committees and scru
tinizing the efficacy of the
honor code.
"As the undergraduate
student body representa
tives, we have a role in seeing
whether the honor code
needs to be overhauled," Fin
ley said. "We also need to
make sure accused individu

als have their rights pre
served."

The University is current
ly in the process of discussing
the efficacy of the Honor
Code, a contractual under
standing between students
and the faculty.
"If we are to discuss the
Honor Code, we need to work
with the Office of University
Standards and Judicial Af
fairs," Finley said. "In order
for there to be a serious com
prehensive approach to that
situation, we will need serious
communication, which will re
quire experienced ASSU offi
cials who were involved with
forging the honor code
many of whom will be gradu
ating this year."
Similar to Holston, Finley
has singled out problems of
communication between stu
dent representatives chosen
by the Nomination Commit
tee and the ASSU.
"We often have student
voice represented in commit
tees, but we have never creat
ed a relationship between
them and the ASSU," Finley
said. "We need to repair this
avenue of communication be
tween the ASSU Senate and
Nomination Committee rep
resentatives."
If elected, Finley will be
the only Senator who has ex
perience with the Appropria
tions Committee, SAFE Re
form bylaws, Judicial Affairs
and Joint-Legislative Com
mittee.
Voting will take place on
April 10 and 11.

Finley
Finley, who co-led the
Joint Legislative Committee
on Judicial Affairs and led
the Senate's Administration
and Rules Committee, is the
Senate's expert on the ASSU
Constitution and bylaws. Ac
cording to Finley, his particu
lar duties require a large
amount of institutional
knowledge and experience in
the ASSU.

"It took me about a quar
ter and a half to familiarize
myself with the Constitution
al bylaws and processes of
the Senate," Finley said.
This year, Finley's plat
form rests on upholding com
munity standards, reviewing
the method in which the stu
dents are appointed to Uni
versity committees and scru
tinizing the efficacy of the
honor code.
"As the undergraduate
student body representa
tives, we have a role in seeing
whether the honor code
needs to be overhauled," Fin
ley said. "We also need to
make sure accused individu

als have their rights pre
served."

The University is current
ly in the process of discussing
the efficacy of the Honor
Code, a contractual under
standing between students
and the faculty.
"If we are to discuss the
Honor Code, we need to work
with the Office of University
Standards and Judicial Af
fairs," Finley said. "In order
for there to be a serious com
prehensive approach to that
situation, we will need serious
communication, which will re
quire experienced ASSU offi
cials who were involved with
forging the honor code
many of whom will be gradu
ating this year."
Similar to Holston, Finley
has singled out problems of
communication between stu
dent representatives chosen
by the Nomination Commit
tee and the ASSU.
"We often have student
voice represented in commit
tees, but we have never creat
ed a relationship between
them and the ASSU," Finley
said. "We need to repair this
avenue of communication be

resentatives."
If elected, Finley will be
the only Senator who has ex

Two members of the 15th ASSU
Undergraduate Senate will seek re
election to a second term through
this year's spring ballot, making
them the first incumbent Senators
to do so in three years. The Daily
sat down with Senate Chair Ben
Holston 'l5 and Senator John-Lan
caster Finley 'l6 to discuss their
time in office and their plans for
their second term.
Holston
During his time leading the 15th
Undergraduate Senate, Holston
helped champion the SAFE Re
form proposal, a measure that aims
to simplify and improve the current
student activities funding system.
The bill will join Holston on this
year's ballot.
"[lf the bill passes] we will be in
stituting a new funding system,"
Holston said. "There will be tons of
work involved educating student
groups and funding system will
change pretty significantly."
Looking ahead to a prospective
second term, Holston said that he
hopes to employ his experi
ence in educating future
Senators and student group
leaders on the dynamics be
hind the measure and the de
tails of the new quick, minor
and major grant options
open for students.
"I know that leadership
[will be] required in enacting
SAFE Reform with the new
group of incoming sena
tors," Holston said as a rea
son for his decision to run
again.
Holston's campaign last
year was centered on help
ing student-athletes and re
solving student dining con
flicts as elicited by the
Suites controversy. While
the latter issue has since
been resolved, Holston a
former varsity swimmer
himself —said that helping
student-athletes will remain
a priority for him going for
ward.
"A huge part of what I
want to do [is] with athlet
ics," Holston said. "I want to
get them better class times
because practices often oc
cur during the [current]
times. A lot of these guys
have to come back for a fifth
year and pay tuition for an
other year because they
couldn't take some of those
classes because of travel
policies."
Holston also identified
improving academic depart
ment communication of class

issues and facilitating a more
unified ASSU as priorities.
With regards to the latter, he
expressed interest in devel
oping joint initiatives be
tween the Senate and the
ASSU Executive to improve
inter-departmental and insti
tutional communication.
"Ben and John-Lancast
er's re-election will encour
age a continuation of institu
tional knowledge," said Sena
tor Zane Hellmann 'l6. "In
stitutional knowledge is
quickly lost in the undergrad
uate career due to a one year
turnover and having two [vet
eran members] will help the
next senate. They are great
candidates, and I fully sup
port their reelection."
