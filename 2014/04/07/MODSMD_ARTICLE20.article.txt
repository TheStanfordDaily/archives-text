team effort today," said head

showed grit, they fought for
everything and they did a
great job of covering each
other when they needed to.
We are definitely peaking at
the right time."

led the way with a third
place finish in the all-around

with a 39.475 to accompany a

floor and emerging with a pair
of third-place finishes in the
first two while finishing in a
tie for ninth place in the floor.

of the top three in bars for the
Cardinal with a 9.900 to equal
her personal best.
