## Worldview connects researchers 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
Beginning this June, Stan
ford will offer a set of courses
that will be offered to a small
online community of profes
sionals and that will eventually
culminate in a visit to campus
later in the summer.
The Worldview Stanford
program emphasizes bringing
together information about
various important current
events ranging from the fu
ture of China to climate
change from different disci
plines of research across the
University.
According to program di
rector Brie Linkenhoker, the
main purpose of Worldview is

to connect the research that is
being done at Stanford to the
broader community and to de
cision makers.
"Professors who do re
search here don't normally get
to interact with the very peo
ple who are using their re
search," Linkenhoker said.
"Worldview was built around
the idea that people get the op
portunity to learn from the re
search being done at Stanford,
and for Stanford to get an idea
of what kind of research or in
formation people are looking
for out there."
There will be no traditional
professor for the Worldview
courses. Instead, course mate
rial will be compiled by a
Worldview core team that

pulls together research and in
formation from various ex
perts in the Stanford commu
nity.

William Newsome, profes
sor of neurobiology and one of
the faculty mentors, stated
that Worldview could benefit
Stanford researchers by facili
tating connections between
the research and the con
sumers of the research.

"We're busy and we don't
know how to translate our
work and findings in language
that can be used well," New
some said. "Worldview can
help translate what we find
and what we discover into
practical lessons."
At time of publication,
there will be three courses of
fered this coming year by
Worldview Stanford The
Science of Decision Making,
The Fiitures of China and En
vironmental Risk and Re
silience.
Linkenhoker argued that
Worldview Stanford could help
bring to light the uniqueness
of Stanford's interdisciplinary
research.
"Given Stanford's great
strengths in interdisciplinary
scholarships... it felt like we
could leverage that really well
if we could find out how to
package and frame [the knowl
edge] in away to help Stanford
have a bigger impact on deci
sion making and ensure that
