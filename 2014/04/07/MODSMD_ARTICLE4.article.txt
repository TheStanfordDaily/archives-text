## Research team refines production of artificial diamonds 
### â€” Andrew Vogeley 
While the diamond industry has traditional
ly had to use massive amounts of pressure to
create artificial diamonds, a team of Stanford
researchers has discovered a much simpler
and more flexible way to make artificial dia
monds from graphite.
The team of researchers, led by SLAC Na
tional Accelerator Laboratory associate staff
scientist Sarp Kaya, initially set out to make a

high-performance replacement for silicon from
graphene to use in transistors. Instead of find
ing a substitute for silicon, however, the team
discovered a process that turned the graphene
layers into a diamond-like film.
The researchers found that introducing hy
drogen creates chemical bonds between the
bottom layer of graphene and platinum sub
strate. These bonds mimic the strong bonds
found in real diamonds.
Artificial diamonds are typically manufac
tured by applying extremely high levels of
pressure to graphite, which reconfigures
their atomic structure into a more stable, dia-
