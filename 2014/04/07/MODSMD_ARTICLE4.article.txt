## Research team refines production of artificial diamonds 
### — Andrew Vogeley 
While the diamond industry has traditional
ly had to use massive amounts of pressure to
create artificial diamonds, a team of Stanford
researchers has discovered a much simpler
and more flexible way to make artificial dia
monds from graphite.
The team of researchers, led by SLAC Na
tional Accelerator Laboratory associate staff
scientist Sarp Kaya, initially set out to make a

high-performance replacement for silicon from
graphene to use in transistors. Instead of find
ing a substitute for silicon, however, the team
discovered a process that turned the graphene
layers into a diamond-like film.
The researchers found that introducing hy
drogen creates chemical bonds between the
bottom layer of graphene and platinum sub
strate. These bonds mimic the strong bonds
found in real diamonds.
Artificial diamonds are typically manufac
tured by applying extremely high levels of
pressure to graphite, which reconfigures
their atomic structure into a more stable, dia-
A team of computer sci
entists, including a Stanford
professor and doctoral stu
dent, recently identified
some indicators that can as

tos on Facebook will go viral.
After analyzing 150,000
Facebook photos that had
been shared at least five
times, the group was able to
predict with 80 percent accu
racy whether or not a photo

would double in shares.
The group found that the
speed of sharing was the
best predictor of whether
the photos would double in
the number of shares. Addi
tionally, the way that a photo
was shared was also a pow
erful predictor. Photos that
were shared among differ
ent friendship networks and
fan groups were more likely
to go viral than photos that
were only shared within a
specific network.
The researchers, howev
er, have not been unable to
determine what content in
the photo actually makes a
photo go viral.
"Even if you have the
best cat picture ever, it could
work for your network, but
not for my boring academic
friends," said Jure
Leskovec, assistant profes
sor of computer science, to
the Stanford News Service.
"You have to understand
your network."
