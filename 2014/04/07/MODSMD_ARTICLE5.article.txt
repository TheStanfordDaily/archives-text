# Ansari wows in performance
## Show marred by ticket controversy 
### AARON SEKHRI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On Friday night, Stanford got
to "treat, yo. self," as Aziz Ansari,
donning a red velvet tuxedo,
brought his trademark material
and delivery to Dinkelspiel Audi
torium to an enthralled crowd of
mostly undergraduate students.
The "Parks and Recreation"
star was in the area as a part of
his "Modern Romance" tour and
fresh off of a Thursday night
show at Davies Symphony Hall in
San Francisco.
Ansari, a consummately mod
ern comedian, focused mostly on
the topics of relationships, in
stant communication, marriage
and the culture of dating in the
United States.
Most of the material was
drawn from his personal experi
ences and those of his friends, as
well as those of some audience
members.
"Now may be the most stress
ful time ever to be single," Ansari
lamented, describing how text
messaging and social media have
made sincere communication and
intimacy difficult, if not impossi
ble.
In between jokes, he waxed
philosophical, talking about what
he saw as the defining traits of
the generation he was a part of,
and the generation he was ad

dressing.
"This is the flakiest genera
tion of all time. But it's also the
least lonely generation," he said.
"We always want the best be
cause we all have all of this infor
mation, but why do we need this
assurance?"
He addressed a seemingly
pathological aversion to commit
ment (of any sorts) and exten
sively discussed the culture of
texting. He involved members of
the audience, soliciting real text
conversations students had had
with people they had just met. In
typical Stanford fashion, the very
first participant's text in the con
versation was about a startup
(which eventually got Ansari's
seal of approval).
Ansari ended the show with
an encore consisting of crowd fa
vorites, and some new material
from his "Buried Alive" comedy
show.
The event was the first of
what Cardinal Nights - the Office
of Alcohol Policy and Education's
(OAPE) alcohol-free program
ming initiative hopes will be a
marquee event it holds every
year, in an effort to improve its
programming and host more top
tier events.
"I think from last year to this
year we are trying to have more

of a presence and [host] big
ger-scale events," said Ralph
Castro, the director of the
Office of Alcohol Policy and
Education, in a previous in
terview with The Daily.
According to OAPE As
sistant Director Trista
Shideler, the event cost
about $60,000 and required
funding approval from the
Undergraduate Senate.
The event was not with
out its share of controversy,
however. It was held in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium
(which has a capacity of 716)
as Memorial Auditorium was
not available, because of the
Ram's Head Theatrical Soci
ety's preparations for "Les
Miserables." Consequently,
there were significantly few
er tickets available than
there otherwise could have
been.
There was also a slight
website malfunction due to

the excessive demand for the
event, with many students
unable to see the status of
their order properly.
"About 2,100 people
logged in at 8 p.m. on Mon
day to get tickets," Shideler
said. "Within that hour, we

had over 112,000 page views
on the Eventbrite."
Some students were actu
ally able to get tickets many
minutes after others be
lieved that they had all been
sold out, in a phenomenon
that Shideler attributed to a

technical glitch.
The event was sponsored
by Cardinal Nights, the
Stanford Speakers' Bureau
and the ASSU.
