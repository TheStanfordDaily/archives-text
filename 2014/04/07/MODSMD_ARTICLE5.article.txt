# Ansari wows in performance
## Show marred by ticket controversy 
### AARON SEKHRI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On Friday night, Stanford got
to "treat, yo. self," as Aziz Ansari,
donning a red velvet tuxedo,
brought his trademark material
and delivery to Dinkelspiel Audi
torium to an enthralled crowd of
mostly undergraduate students.
The "Parks and Recreation"
star was in the area as a part of
his "Modern Romance" tour and
fresh off of a Thursday night
show at Davies Symphony Hall in
San Francisco.
Ansari, a consummately mod
ern comedian, focused mostly on
the topics of relationships, in
stant communication, marriage
and the culture of dating in the
United States.
Most of the material was
drawn from his personal experi
ences and those of his friends, as
well as those of some audience
members.
"Now may be the most stress
ful time ever to be single," Ansari
lamented, describing how text
messaging and social media have
made sincere communication and
intimacy difficult, if not impossi
ble.
In between jokes, he waxed
philosophical, talking about what
he saw as the defining traits of
the generation he was a part of,
and the generation he was ad

dressing.
"This is the flakiest genera
tion of all time. But it's also the
least lonely generation," he said.
"We always want the best be
cause we all have all of this infor
mation, but why do we need this
assurance?"
He addressed a seemingly
pathological aversion to commit
ment (of any sorts) and exten
sively discussed the culture of
texting. He involved members of
the audience, soliciting real text
conversations students had had
with people they had just met. In
typical Stanford fashion, the very
first participant's text in the con
versation was about a startup
(which eventually got Ansari's
seal of approval).
Ansari ended the show with
an encore consisting of crowd fa
vorites, and some new material
from his "Buried Alive" comedy
show.
The event was the first of
what Cardinal Nights - the Office
of Alcohol Policy and Education's
(OAPE) alcohol-free program
ming initiative hopes will be a
marquee event it holds every
year, in an effort to improve its
programming and host more top
tier events.
"I think from last year to this
year we are trying to have more
