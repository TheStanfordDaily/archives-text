# FELLED IN THE FINAL FOUR
## Stanford falls to Connecticut to end season 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
Cardinal fans at Bridgestone Arena
in Nashville, Tenn., said farewell to
Chiney Ogwumike one of the greatest
athletes in Stanford women's basketball
history when the Cardinal women's
basketball squad (33-4) fell to No. 1 Con
necticut (39-0) in the Final Four of the
NCAA Tournament on Sunday, 75-56.
In the final game of her collegiate ca
reer, Ogwumike battled under the bas
ket against the imposing size of the
Huskies' frontcourt. Despite being held
to just four points in the first half, the

three-time WBCA All-American and
National Player of the Year candidate
finished with 15 points (a season low), 10
rebounds and four assists, notching her
27th double-double of the season.

Freshman guard Lili Thompson (center) capped off her impressive freshman
campaign with a solid showing in the Cardinal's loss to the Huskies, totaling
12 points on 5-of-9 shooting, including two 3-pointers, in 37 minutes of play.


double digits, with freshman
Lili Thompson Stanford's
"future great player" accord
ing to head coach Tara Van-
Derveer tallying 12 points
and junior Amber Orrange
leading the team with 16
points, five assists, and two
steals, the Huskies were too
much to handle. Armed with
the best defense in the coun
try and three WBCA Ail-
Americans, head coach Geno
Auriemma and his team were
the favorites heading into the
matchup and didn't lessen
their intensity except for a
fleeting part of the first half.
Stanford's 56 points in the
game were the fewest it has
scored in a game all season.
"Our team is, I think, real
ly disappointed, with how we
played, especially in the sec
ond half. And I think we real
ly struggled," VanDerveer
said. "We turned the ball over
too much in the second half.
And we did not do a good
enough job defensively."
If the game were only 15
minutes long, the Cardinal
would have come out on top.
Because for those 15 minutes
the Cardinal played brilliant
ly and confidently, even with
the Huskies shutting down
Ogwumike down low. Stan
ford took advantage of poor
shooting by Connecticut and
capitalized on strong re
bounding and transition
buckets. A 3-pointer by
Thompson at the 12:34 mark
of the first half gave Stanford
its largest lead of the half at
16-10.

sary for it to take down the
undefeated Huskies.
"I think we did a great job
in the first half managing the
game and taking timely
shots, and people were ag
gressive in finishing," Ogwu
mike said. "Things got a little
away from us in the second
half. Maybe if two things
went our way we could have
swayed the momentum. But
that's just the way the game
goes sometimes."
In the opening minute of
the second half, Ogwumike
knocked down the only Car
dinal basket in the first six
minutes of play. After a half
of being swarmed under the
basket, with different defend
ers switching on and off of
her, Ogwumike decided to try
her luck at shooting and
knocked down a 3-point shot.
The Cardinal, however, went
cold from the field for the
next five minutes of play,
while Connecticut took its
first double-digit lead of the
game and never looked back.
All Husky starters scored
in double digits, led by one of
the few players who could
take away the Wade Trophy
Award from Ogwumike:
sophomore Breanna Stewart.
Stewart finished the game
with 18 points, seven re
bounds and two blocked
shots, all while playing sti
fling defense underneath the
basket.
With Connecticut shoot
ing an impressive 60 percent
from the field in the second
half, it would be near impossi
ble for any team to beat it.
But the Cardinal, despite
shooting just 38 percent for
the game, never relinquished
their energy and remained
within 11 points after a layup
from Ogwumike with 4:13 to
play. Stanford, however,
couldn't turn defensive stops
into points on the other end
and the Husky lead widened.

The tables soon turned,
however, as the Huskies end
ed the half on a 12-2 scoring
run that put them up 28-24 at
the half. The second half
turned into a burst of output
from Connecticut, which hit
four of its first five shots a
stretch which was coupled
with a dip in efficiency for the
Cardinal as they went l-of-9
to start the half. Thirteen
turnovers, getting beat on
the offensive boards, an off
shooting night and the inabil
ity to penetrate into the key
kept Stanford from the near
perfect game that was neces-

The Cardinal battled under
the basket and challenged
the Huskies with the aggres
sion and tenacity that it
lacked the first time the
teams met in November. The
Card might not have been
able to execute effectively for
40 minutes, but it played with
heart for the full 40 minutes.
Ogwumike ends her colle
giate career with back-to
back Pac-12 Player of the
Year and Defensive Player of
the Year Awards, three trips
to the Final Four, four Pac-12
conference wins and three
Pac-12 Tournament crowns.
Her legacy arguably surpass
es that of her sister Nneka
Ogwumike 'l2, as the
younger sister reigns as the
No. 1 all-time scoring and re
bounding leader in program
history. It was also the last
game for seniors Sara James,
Mikaela Ruef and Toni Koke
nis.
"I think [my career at
Stanford] has been an amaz
ing run," Ogwumike said.
"I'm not even that emotional
about it because I was just
trying to have fun today, just
have fun, enjoy the moment,
play hard. And that's easy to
do when you have a great
coach and you have great
teammates that support you
every possession. No matter
the outcome. So my experi
ence at Stanford has been a
blessing."
The Cardinal topped off a
successful season with a trip
to the Final Four its sixth
appearance in the past seven
years. That accomplishment
alone being one of the four
best teams in the nation
should not be overlooked, es
pecially considering it fell to
arguably one of the best
starting lineups in the history
of women's basketball.

Thompson at the 12:34 mark
of the first half gave Stanford
its largest lead of the half at
16-10.

sary for it to take down the
undefeated Huskies.
"I think we did a great job
in the first half managing the
game and taking timely
shots, and people were ag
gressive in finishing," Ogwu
mike said. "Things got a little
away from us in the second
half. Maybe if two things
went our way we could have
swayed the momentum. But
that's just the way the game
goes sometimes."
In the opening minute of
the second half, Ogwumike
knocked down the only Car
dinal basket in the first six
minutes of play. After a half
of being swarmed under the
basket, with different defend
ers switching on and off of
her, Ogwumike decided to try
her luck at shooting and
knocked down a 3-point shot.
The Cardinal, however, went
cold from the field for the
next five minutes of play,
while Connecticut took its
first double-digit lead of the
game and never looked back.
All Husky starters scored
in double digits, led by one of
the few players who could
take away the Wade Trophy
Award from Ogwumike:
sophomore Breanna Stewart.
Stewart finished the game
with 18 points, seven re
bounds and two blocked
shots, all while playing sti
fling defense underneath the
basket.
With Connecticut shoot
ing an impressive 60 percent
from the field in the second
half, it would be near impossi
ble for any team to beat it.
But the Cardinal, despite
shooting just 38 percent for
the game, never relinquished
their energy and remained
within 11 points after a layup
from Ogwumike with 4:13 to
play. Stanford, however,
couldn't turn defensive stops
into points on the other end
and the Husky lead widened.

The tables soon turned,
however, as the Huskies end
ed the half on a 12-2 scoring
run that put them up 28-24 at
the half. The second half
turned into a burst of output
from Connecticut, which hit
four of its first five shots a
stretch which was coupled
with a dip in efficiency for the
Cardinal as they went l-of-9
to start the half. Thirteen
turnovers, getting beat on
the offensive boards, an off
shooting night and the inabil
ity to penetrate into the key
kept Stanford from the near
perfect game that was neces-

The Cardinal battled under
the basket and challenged
the Huskies with the aggres
sion and tenacity that it
lacked the first time the
teams met in November. The
Card might not have been
able to execute effectively for
40 minutes, but it played with
heart for the full 40 minutes.
Ogwumike ends her colle
giate career with back-to
back Pac-12 Player of the
Year and Defensive Player of
the Year Awards, three trips
to the Final Four, four Pac-12
conference wins and three
Pac-12 Tournament crowns.
Her legacy arguably surpass
es that of her sister Nneka
Ogwumike 'l2, as the
younger sister reigns as the
No. 1 all-time scoring and re
bounding leader in program
history. It was also the last
game for seniors Sara James,
Mikaela Ruef and Toni Koke
nis.
"I think [my career at
Stanford] has been an amaz
ing run," Ogwumike said.
"I'm not even that emotional
about it because I was just
trying to have fun today, just
have fun, enjoy the moment,
play hard. And that's easy to
do when you have a great
coach and you have great
teammates that support you
every possession. No matter
the outcome. So my experi
ence at Stanford has been a
blessing."
The Cardinal topped off a
successful season with a trip
to the Final Four its sixth
appearance in the past seven
years. That accomplishment
alone being one of the four
best teams in the nation
should not be overlooked, es
pecially considering it fell to
arguably one of the best
starting lineups in the history
of women's basketball.

HEAD COACH TARA VANDERVEER
Cardinal fans at Bridgestone Arena
in Nashville, Tenn., said farewell to
Chiney Ogwumike one of the greatest
athletes in Stanford women's basketball
history when the Cardinal women's
basketball squad (33-4) fell to No. 1 Con
necticut (39-0) in the Final Four of the
NCAA Tournament on Sunday, 75-56.
In the final game of her collegiate ca

Huskies' frontcourt. Despite being held
to just four points in the first half, the

three-time WBCA All-American and
National Player of the Year candidate
finished with 15 points (a season low), 10
rebounds and four assists, notching her
27th double-double of the season.
