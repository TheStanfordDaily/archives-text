## Don't lose faith in baseball's season just yet 
### Michael Peterson 
Admittedly, it's been a
tough year so far for
Stanford baseball.
Stanford, a program
with 16 College World
Series appearances, faces the once
unbelievable prospect of missing
back-to-back postseasons. The Cardi
nal have become accustomed to sit
ting near the top of the Pac-12 but
currently sit in eighth in the confer
ence with an 10-14 record, including
3-6 in Pac-12 play. Four of their losses
two 13-inning defeats to Kansas
and Oregon State and two losses to
USC in which the Cardinal led late in
the game could easily have toned
into wins. From most perspectives,
the season appears to be headed to
wards another early finish without a
berth in an NCAA Regional.
Forget everything—well, at least
a lot you thought you knew about
the Cardinal's postseason chances.
Last Monday, the NCAA released
its first Rating Percentage Index
(RPI) rankings of the season. RPI
rankings factor in a team's record and
strength of schedule to determine the
top teams in the country. The selec
tion committee for the college base
ball postseason uses RPI as a large
determinant in deciding who will
make the postseason. When the rank
ings were released, the Cardinal
stood at 24th, the only team in the na
tion with a losing record to be in the
top 25.
The RPI ranking served as a sign
that the Cardinal are very much alive
in their quest for the postseason.
While their record may not reflect a
strong start to the season, the Cardi
nal have played arguably the nation's
most difficult schedule No. 5 Van
derbilt, No. 7 Oregon State, No. 8
Oregon, No. 11 Texas, No. 14 Rice,
USC and Kansas have been the Car
dinal's weekend opponents so far. The
same schedule that has caused the
difficult start is currently keeping
Stanford on the early bubble of post
season qualification and the exceed
ingly difficult non-conference sched
ule — three of four non-conference
series were against top-15 teams
should continue to differentiate them
from other teams also playing in tal
ented conferences.
Now, the brunt of the difficult
schedule has passed. Other than No.
17 UCLA and No. 24 Washington, the
Cardinal will face unranked opposi
tion the rest of the way. The slight de
crease in strength of schedule hope
fully will be accompanied by an im
proved record. The last three series
of the season pit the Cardinal against
some of the weaker Pac-12 teams:
Arizona, Washington State and Utah.
Even with an easier final stretch
of the season, the Cardinal's strength
of schedule should remain among the
top in the nation, giving the team a
chance to use that final stretch to
earn more wins and potentially finish
with a modest record, a great
strength of schedule and a good RPI.
The great strength of schedule
comes largely as a result of Stanford's
non-conference opponents. While
many other teams chose to fill their
non-conference slate with easy con
tests (neither UCLA, Oregon nor
Oregon State played more than one
ranked team in non-conference play),
the Cardinal challenged themselves.
Thus, if Stanford manages to finish
five or ten games above .500, its
strength of schedule could lift it into
the postseason.
I'm not saying that it's going to be
easy for the Card to make the post
season. The team could easily fall into
a bigger hole against Washington and
UCLA that it fails to overcome. An
inconsistent offense might continue to
hurt the Cardinal in close games.
Stanford could never even reach .500
again this season. But at least there's
a chance.
The poor record should not spell
failure for the Cardinal's season. It's
easy to see the Cardinal's record and
assume that it's too much to over
come, considering that last season's
team missed the postseason after fin
ishing 10 games over .500. However,
last year's team finished in the 60s in
RPI. This year's squad should finish
higher given its strength of schedule.
It's still early in the season, and
that's exactly why it would be foolish
to assume that Stanford doesn't have
a realistic shot at the postseason de
spite sitting at 10-14. Even I have
been guilty of this assumption, but
the RPI ranking reminded me that
Stanford is by no means eliminated
from contention. Stanford has a long
way to go, but where there's a will
