# GOLF SLIPS TO SEVENTH
## 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
Despite relocating to drier
climes for its regular season finale,
the Stanford women's golf team
was ultimately unable to replicate
its impressive performance from
last year's PING/ASU Invitational
at this season's iteration of the
event. The squad, led by freshman
Casey Danielson, finished seventh
in the fifteen-team field in Tempe,
falling to four Pac-12 teams in the
process. It was a far cry from the
Card's T-3rd showing on the
Karsten Course just a season ago,
and shows that Anne Walker's
quintet still has work to do if it is to
realize its postseason aspirations.
Friday's first round was cer
tainly an inauspicious start for the
Cardinal, who witnessed star soph
omore Mariah Stackhouse shoot a
highly uncharacteristic 5-over 77
including two double bogeys
while also counting junior Mariko
Tumangan's 4-over 76. This offset
the solid rounds delivered by
Danielson and sophomore Lauren
Kim, both of whom carded 1-under
71s. But the damage was already
done, as Stanford was now well
back of the leaders in the team
standings, a hole out of which they
never escaped.
The young squad certainly
tried, however, roaring back on
moving day. Stackhouse returned
to her usual form, turning in a 2-
under score anchored by a birdie
on the very tough par-3 sixth hole.
Kim and Danielson again snuck be
low par with 1-under rounds, and
Tumangan improved upon her day
one performance with a 1-over 73.
All told, the Card bettered their
first round aggregate score by 10
strokes, powering up the leader
board and chipping away at their
deficit. Still, the team was 12 shots
behind 36-hole leader and eventual

event winner South Carolina, mak
ing the team's sluggish Friday
start even more glaring.
But Saturday's shift in momen
tum did not last for long, with Sun
day's final frame seeing the Card
revert to its opening-round ways.
This time, the duo of Kim and
Danielson that has been Stanford's
rock during the spring season fal
tered and shot a combined 5-over.
Stackhouse came in with a re
spectable even-par 72, but neither
Tumangan nor freshman Quirine
Eijkenboom were able to post a
low enough fourth score to reverse
the team's fortunes.
At Sunday's end, Stanford had
recorded a 54-hole total of 12-over
876, going 8-over in the final round
to place seventh. The Card ended
up fifth out of the nine Pac-12
teams in the field, four strokes
back of UCLA, eight behind Ari
zona and 17 behind Washington
and host Arizona State. Though
certainly not the worst conceivable
outcome, the Cardinal surely
would have liked to perform better
against their conference foes with
the Pac-12 Tournament looming.
One of the brighter spots in
Tempe for Stanford was the con
tinued development of freshman
Danielson, who was the Cardinal's
low woman after finishing T-12th.
The four-time Wisconsin state golf
champion has improved her game
markedly from the fall season, and
has been her squad's number one
or two performer at each of its five
spring events. With Tumangan
seemingly in a rocky spot of her
season, Danielson's play will con
tinue to be of great significance
with the postseason only a few
weeks away.
"The fall season was a bit of an
adjustment period for me, just be
cause I was getting used to college
and college golf," Danielson said.
"I worked hard heading into the

spring season on many parts of my
game, and Coach Walker helped to
move me in the right direction as I
worked on my swing, putting and
chipping. This [spring] season, my
long irons were much more accu
rate and my up-and-down percent
age was much higher. It was great
to see my hard work pay off."
"At Karsten this week, I really
did drive the ball and hit a lot of
greens," she added. "But I was dis
appointed in my short-game per
formance. So I plan to continue to

work on that heading into the post
season, because both putting and
chipping will be key in order for
me to continue to be competitive in
the future."
Stanford will need her to con
tinue that competitive play
throughout the postseason, which
begins Friday, April 25 at the Pac
-12 Women's Golf Championships in
Corvallis, Ore.
