# Senior Day Success
## Lacrosse splits pair of conference duels 
### KRISTIN A BASSI 
In a doubleheader last week
end, No. 8 Stanford women's
lacrosse (9-2, 3-1 MPSF) fell to
powerhouse Denver (10-1, 4-0
MPSF) 13-12 on Friday before re
bounding to defeat the Colorado
Buffaloes (6-6, 3-2 MPSF) 13-5 to
maintain good standing in the con
ference heading into the final
month of the regular season.
Against Denver, Stanford
jumped out to a solid 6-0 lead with
16:49 left in the first half. After
that, however, Stanford struggled
to find the back of the net despite
taking a total of 25 shots in the
match. Senior Denver goalie Han
nah Hook made six saves to keep
the Pioneers in the game despite
the Cardinal's early success. The
Cardinal seemed to have trouble
adjusting to scoring on Hook, a
left-handed goalie. Several shots
were placed to the left of the goal,
normally the weak side for right
handed goalies, and easily saved
by Hook's stick as the match pro
gressed.
Gaining momentum from its
defensive saves, Denver coun
tered with five goals to end the
first half and make the score close,
making it 7-6 heading into the
break. The Pioneers would go on
to take the lead with 10:18 left to
play on an unassisted goal by jun
ior midfielder Rachel Dillon.
The game remained very close
and junior Kyle Fraser eventually
tied up the score at 12 with 8:37 to
play in the match. However, Den
ver didn't take its foot off the ped
al as it outscored the Cardinal 6-2
in the final 21 minutes, with senior
midfielder Meredith Harris scor
ing the game-winner with 6:41 left
her fifth goal of the match. Har
ris leads the Pioneer offense with
38 goals, and also has 10 assists
and 12 draw controls this season.
"We need to know how to finish
our opponents," said Stanford
head coach Amy Bokker to
GoStanford.com. "Both losses
were games we were up five-plus

goals. We're too kind in those situ
ations. We start to lose our disci
pline and our patience."
Despite the tough loss, there
were great performances for the
Cardinal, including one from soph
omore midfielder and Denver na
tive Lucy Dikeou, who led the of
fense with three goals, live draw
controls, two ground balls and a
turnover caused. In addition, jun
ior Hannah Farr scored two goals
and had three draw controls. Eras
er and senior Rachel Ozer also
scored two each for Stanford.
The Cardinal returned to ac
tion on Sunday and rebounded as
they faced Colorado on their Sen
ior Day. Stanford, led by the de
fense of senior Megan Lerner, got
the 13-5 victory over the Buf
faloes.

Stanford took a season-high 40
shots, with nine different players
scoring. Farr scored three, while
Ozer and freshman Alex Poplaws

ki scored two apiece. The Cardinal
led the entire game and added a
dominating win to their record.
Coming off the Denver game,
in which the Cardinal exhibited
trouble scoring, the team was not
only able to score goals but also
did so in response to Colorado's
successes and did it fast. On one
occasion, Farr finished off a pass
from sophomore Alexandra Cr
erend only ten seconds after a Col
orado goal. During another se
quence, Farr and Poplawski
scored about thirteen seconds
apart.
Lerner, clearly leading the
team and the defense, earned
eight draw controls (one less than
her own single-game school
record), caused three turnovers
and picked up three ground balls.

In a doubleheader last week
end, No. 8 Stanford women's
lacrosse (9-2, 3-1 MPSF) fell to
powerhouse Denver (10-1, 4-0
MPSF) 13-12 on Friday before re
bounding to defeat the Colorado
Buffaloes (6-6, 3-2 MPSF) 13-5 to
maintain good standing in the con
ference heading into the final
month of the regular season.
Against Denver, Stanford
jumped out to a solid 6-0 lead with
16:49 left in the first half. After
that, however, Stanford struggled
to find the back of the net despite
taking a total of 25 shots in the
match. Senior Denver goalie Han
nah Hook made six saves to keep
the Pioneers in the game despite
the Cardinal's early success. The
Cardinal seemed to have trouble
adjusting to scoring on Hook, a
left-handed goalie. Several shots
were placed to the left of the goal,
normally the weak side for right
handed goalies, and easily saved
by Hook's stick as the match pro
gressed.
Gaining momentum from its
defensive saves, Denver coun
tered with five goals to end the
first half and make the score close,
making it 7-6 heading into the
break. The Pioneers would go on
to take the lead with 10:18 left to
play on an unassisted goal by jun
ior midfielder Rachel Dillon.
The game remained very close
and junior Kyle Fraser eventually
tied up the score at 12 with 8:37 to
play in the match. However, Den
ver didn't take its foot off the ped
al as it outscored the Cardinal 6-2
in the final 21 minutes, with senior
midfielder Meredith Harris scor
ing the game-winner with 6:41 left
her fifth goal of the match. Har
ris leads the Pioneer offense with
38 goals, and also has 10 assists
and 12 draw controls this season.
"We need to know how to finish
our opponents," said Stanford
head coach Amy Bokker to
GoStanford.com. "Both losses
were games we were up five-plus

goals. We're too kind in those situ
ations. We start to lose our disci
pline and our patience."
Despite the tough loss, there
were great performances for the
Cardinal, including one from soph
omore midfielder and Denver na
tive Lucy Dikeou, who led the of
fense with three goals, live draw
controls, two ground balls and a
turnover caused. In addition, jun
ior Hannah Farr scored two goals
and had three draw controls. Eras
er and senior Rachel Ozer also
scored two each for Stanford.
The Cardinal returned to ac
tion on Sunday and rebounded as
they faced Colorado on their Sen
ior Day. Stanford, led by the de
fense of senior Megan Lerner, got
the 13-5 victory over the Buf
faloes.

Stanford took a season-high 40
shots, with nine different players
scoring. Farr scored three, while
Ozer and freshman Alex Poplaws

ki scored two apiece. The Cardinal
led the entire game and added a
dominating win to their record.
Coming off the Denver game,
in which the Cardinal exhibited
trouble scoring, the team was not
only able to score goals but also
did so in response to Colorado's
successes and did it fast. On one
occasion, Farr finished off a pass
from sophomore Alexandra Cr
erend only ten seconds after a Col
orado goal. During another se
quence, Farr and Poplawski
scored about thirteen seconds
apart.
Lerner, clearly leading the
team and the defense, earned
eight draw controls (one less than
her own single-game school
record), caused three turnovers
and picked up three ground balls.
