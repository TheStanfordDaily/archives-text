## Sunken plays host to Aggies Card face UC-Davis after sweep 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
In the midst of a four-game los
ing streak, Stanford baseball re
turns home to face the UC-Davis
Aggies (14-14, 1-5 Big West) on
Tuesday as it looks to bounce back
after suffering a sweep at the
hands of the Oregon State Beavers.
Stanford (10-14, 3-6 Pac-12)
dropped three games in Corvallis,
Ore., including two one-run games,
this past weekend. Meanwhile, UC-
Davis stands at 14-14 after having
faced several top-ranked teams so
far this season. The Aggies went 1-
8 against No. 6 Cal Poly, No. 16 Cal
State-Fullerton and No. 24 Wash
ington, with the only win coming
against Cal State-Fullerton last
weekend. The Aggies' schedule still
doesn't measure up with the Cardi
nal's challenging schedule, though,
as Stanford has played 15 games
against teams ranked in the top 14.
The Cardinal's sporadic offense
sputtered against the Beavers, con
tinuing a trend that has seen the
team average 1.86 runs in losses
versus 6.90 runs in wins. The team
has not scored more than two runs
in its past five contests and only
managed two runs total over the
three games against Oregon State.
However, Stanford should fare
better at the plate against the Ag
gies, who enter today's game with a
4.36 team ERA. No Aggie that has
started a game on the mound this
season has an ERA better than
3.55.

For Stanford, junior third base
man Alex Blandino continues to
thrive at the plate despite the team's
overall straggles, leading the team
with a .321 average and a .426 on
base percentage. He made his first
career start as the leadoff hitter on
Sunday, moving from the three-hole
in the lineup, after drawing three
walks in the previous game. Sopho
more outfielder Zach Hoffpauir also
posted back-to-back two-hit games
to finish the series against Oregon
