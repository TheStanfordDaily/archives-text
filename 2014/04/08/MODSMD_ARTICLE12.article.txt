## Sunken plays host to Aggies Card face UC-Davis after sweep 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
In the midst of a four-game los
ing streak, Stanford baseball re
turns home to face the UC-Davis
Aggies (14-14, 1-5 Big West) on
Tuesday as it looks to bounce back
after suffering a sweep at the
hands of the Oregon State Beavers.
Stanford (10-14, 3-6 Pac-12)
dropped three games in Corvallis,
Ore., including two one-run games,
this past weekend. Meanwhile, UC-
Davis stands at 14-14 after having
faced several top-ranked teams so
far this season. The Aggies went 1-
8 against No. 6 Cal Poly, No. 16 Cal
State-Fullerton and No. 24 Wash
ington, with the only win coming
against Cal State-Fullerton last
weekend. The Aggies' schedule still
doesn't measure up with the Cardi
nal's challenging schedule, though,
as Stanford has played 15 games
against teams ranked in the top 14.
The Cardinal's sporadic offense
sputtered against the Beavers, con
tinuing a trend that has seen the
team average 1.86 runs in losses
versus 6.90 runs in wins. The team
has not scored more than two runs
in its past five contests and only
managed two runs total over the
three games against Oregon State.
However, Stanford should fare
better at the plate against the Ag
gies, who enter today's game with a
4.36 team ERA. No Aggie that has
started a game on the mound this
season has an ERA better than
3.55.

For Stanford, junior third base
man Alex Blandino continues to
thrive at the plate despite the team's
overall straggles, leading the team
with a .321 average and a .426 on
base percentage. He made his first
career start as the leadoff hitter on
Sunday, moving from the three-hole
in the lineup, after drawing three
walks in the previous game. Sopho
more outfielder Zach Hoffpauir also
posted back-to-back two-hit games
to finish the series against Oregon
State.
Stanford has also contin
ued to leave runners on
base, particularly this past
Saturday against Oregon
State when they left 13 run
ners on base through the
first eight innings, including
six innings in which a runner
was left in scoring position.
The Cardinal have also hit
only one home run since
Feb. 23.

The Aggies boast a sen
ior-heavy lineup, with five of
their six leading hitters
coming from that class. Sen
iors Adam Young and
Steven Patterson and junior
Kevin Barker lead a lineup
that has not scored more

than four runs in its last
seven games and currently
places fifth in the Big West
conference in batting aver
age. Young tops the team
with a .388 average while
Barker leads the team with
37 hits and Patterson leads
the team with 18 RBIs.
After facing two talented
offensive teams in the Ore
gon Ducks and the Oregon
State Beavers, Stanford
should be more than ready
for the Aggies' lineup, espe
cially considering the recent
dominance exhibited by the
Cardinal's pitching staff.
Stanford held the Beavers
to only seven runs over the
series, including only one
unearned run surrendered
by the bullpen in 13.1 in
nings pitched. The team's
3.09 ERA is good for fourth
in the Pac-12.
The Cardinal will likely

use a combination of several
pitchers who will throw just
a few innings each in Tues
day's game. Freshman
Tyler Thorne may start on
the mound, as he has twice
on Tuesdays this season, for
the third start of his career.
Thorne is 2-0 with a 2.50
ERA in 18.0 innings pitched
and has become a reliable
spot starter and reliever for
the Card, even earning two
saves. Stanford has not
played a weekday game
since March 4, when Thorne
took the hill and earned his
second win, as both of its two
previous weekday games
have been rained out.
First pitch on Tuesday is
scheduled for 5:30 p.m. be
tween Stanford and UC-
Davis at Sunken Diamond.

doesn't measure up with the Cardi
nal's challenging schedule, though,
as Stanford has played 15 games
against teams ranked in the top 14.
The Cardinal's sporadic offense
sputtered against the Beavers, con
tinuing a trend that has seen the
team average 1.86 runs in losses
versus 6.90 runs in wins. The team
has not scored more than two runs
in its past five contests and only
managed two runs total over the
three games against Oregon State.
However, Stanford should fare
better at the plate against the Ag
gies, who enter today's game with a
4.36 team ERA. No Aggie that has
started a game on the mound this
season has an ERA better than
3.55.

For Stanford, junior third base
man Alex Blandino continues to
thrive at the plate despite the team's
overall straggles, leading the team
with a .321 average and a .426 on
base percentage. He made his first
career start as the leadoff hitter on
Sunday, moving from the three-hole
in the lineup, after drawing three
walks in the previous game. Sopho
more outfielder Zach Hoffpauir also
posted back-to-back two-hit games
to finish the series against Oregon
State.
Stanford has also contin
ued to leave runners on
base, particularly this past
Saturday against Oregon
State when they left 13 run
ners on base through the
first eight innings, including
six innings in which a runner
was left in scoring position.
The Cardinal have also hit
only one home run since
Feb. 23.

The Aggies boast a sen
ior-heavy lineup, with five of
their six leading hitters
coming from that class. Sen
iors Adam Young and
Steven Patterson and junior
Kevin Barker lead a lineup
that has not scored more

than four runs in its last
seven games and currently
places fifth in the Big West
conference in batting aver
age. Young tops the team
with a .388 average while
Barker leads the team with
37 hits and Patterson leads
the team with 18 RBIs.
After facing two talented
offensive teams in the Ore
gon Ducks and the Oregon
State Beavers, Stanford
should be more than ready
for the Aggies' lineup, espe
cially considering the recent
dominance exhibited by the
Cardinal's pitching staff.
Stanford held the Beavers
to only seven runs over the
series, including only one
unearned run surrendered
by the bullpen in 13.1 in
nings pitched. The team's
3.09 ERA is good for fourth
in the Pac-12.
The Cardinal will likely

use a combination of several
pitchers who will throw just
a few innings each in Tues
day's game. Freshman
Tyler Thorne may start on
the mound, as he has twice
on Tuesdays this season, for
the third start of his career.
Thorne is 2-0 with a 2.50
ERA in 18.0 innings pitched
and has become a reliable
spot starter and reliever for
the Card, even earning two
saves. Stanford has not
played a weekday game
since March 4, when Thorne
took the hill and earned his
second win, as both of its two
previous weekday games
have been rained out.
First pitch on Tuesday is
scheduled for 5:30 p.m. be
tween Stanford and UC-
Davis at Sunken Diamond.
