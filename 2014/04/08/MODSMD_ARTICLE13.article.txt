## THE
						HUMANITIES IN THE 21ST CENTURY April 7-11, 2014 Beyond the idea of "major": the scope of the humanities at Stanford 
### Eavan Boland 
In 2013, the National Humani
ties Center began its annual re
port with a provocative state
ment. "Of all the things in this
world that 'go together like a horse
and carriage,'" the report said,
"few pair bonds are as tight as 'the
humanities' and 'crisis.'"
As a participant in and direc
tor of —a humanities program at
Stanford, the English Departmen
t's Creative Writing Program, the
words make me uneasy. Not be
cause they're dire, but because
they're vague. Putting together
large terms like "crisis" and broad
er categories like "humanities" is
bound to generate discussion, but
not necessarily solutions.
Certainly there are concerns.
Humanities majors understandably
fear that the job market privileges
different skills than those they
might acquire. Yet the evidence is
to the contrary. Good writing, good
reading, problem solving and artic
ulate argument all gifts of the
humanities are building blocks
that are seen as valuable by many
employers.
But in the current job climate, a
predictable, immediate connection
between choices at university and
the workplace can be hoped for and
achieved, but not guaranteed. This
understandably troubles many stu
dents, even leading them away
from choices they would like to
make to those they think they
should make.
All of this in turn has led to an
important Stanford-wide conversa
tion about the humanities. But isn't
there a chance that something
could get lost in a theoretical dis
cussion? Isn't it possible that in dis
cussing the "decline of the humani
ties" we might forget where the re
al focus is? That in coming to the
defense of a branch of studies
whose definition was never ab
solutely clear, we might overlook
one aspect on which we could all
agree?
While the humanities are being
talked about or even talked away,
could we be looking in the wrong di
rection? Instead of the humanities,
isn't it the potential humanist in
every single student who comes to
Stanford that is the real and cur
rent challenge? Isn't it possible
that, seen from this aspect, the hu
manities at Stanford far from
being a cause for pessimism

might actually be an endlessly re
newable resource, regardless of
major?
Do I believe in that humanist? I
really do. I also believe in creative
writing; we have the figures to
prove it. While we value and appre
ciate the often brilliant and scholar
ly teaching in the English Depart
ment that goes with the English
major with a Creative Writing em
phasis — and think our students
are lucky to have it we have seen
a number of new developments in
the past decade that we believe are
evolving new structures. And we
are excited to participate in them.
We have an open-minded, em
pirical and gifted cohort of lectur
ers. What they are seeing and re
porting is striking. Last fall, one of
our lecturers remarked that her en
tire non-fiction class was composed
of math majors. In the spring of
2013, 80 percent of our creative
writing students were non-English
majors. Our lecturers take real
pleasure in these students, not be
cause they are surprised by them,
but because they are not. As writ
ers themselves, they know there is
nothing predictable about the con
text for creativity.
I believe this new humanist
should participate fully in redefin
ing the humanities and in helping to
set the terms of the debate. Not
theoretical discussion, however en
lightened. Nor committees, howev
er far-reaching. Which means

We recognize
the humanist
potential of
science majors
and the science
interests of others.
