# In defense of the humanities, computer science and the not-so-book-drunk English major

Fire up your favorite search
browser, and you'll find that
for every article written "in
defense of the humanities," there
exists a second one covering the
gazillion-dollar acquisition of a
Stanford start-up, five Instagrams
of a Google workplace perk and 10
Facebook photos of classmates va
cationing in a luxurious part of the
world because they worked at
Facebook or Google the previous
summer.
The latter finds do a good job of
continuing to ask if not literally
the hottest question of the
2010s: Why study the humani
ties ? Why study the humanities at
Stanford, a school whose relation
ship with Silicon Valley seems to
run even thicker than blood?
I did not ask myself those ques
tions when I switched from pre-med
Hum√üio to English my junior year.
Instead, I asked them the following
summer, when I ate purple velvet
cupcakes at Yahoo and oysters at
Apple courtesy of friends, and lis
tened to those friends talk about
finding apartments without giving
much consideration to money at all.
I asked those questions, like many
other humanities students, at my
first career fair (in other words, my
first blast of post-graduation reali
ty). I asked them when a professor
referred to English majors as
"book-drunk" intellectuals, and I

thought, rather frantically, am I
book-drunk enough?
I am not saying that purple vel
vet cupcakes made me question my
academic decisions not even
close. But free cupcakes and nap
pods represent something greater:
a future of financial stability, funds
to perhaps travel the world and re
spectability, at least in the sense
that you didn't, quantitatively
speaking, squander your parents'
hard-earned money. And if, like me,
the image you associate with "book
drunk" is a Daisy Buchanan-esque
character tossing and drowning in
books like they were the fine silk T
shirts of Leonardo DiCaprio, then
the promise of security, and even a
few luxuries, is enough to make a
not-as-book-drunk English major
start second-guessing herself.
I had wanted to study English
because I liked to read, write and
analyze, and I wanted to learn
about literature in a structured set
ting. I thought I would get into the
magazine or publishing industry
and work on my own writing at
night. I knew, however, that I was
n't "passionate" enough to become
a professor, enter academia and re
search a subject for decades.
Yet what I discovered, after
switching into the major, was that
nearly every time I told someone I
studied English, he or she would
answer, "You're doing what you

love," "So you've seen the light," or
"At least, you're doing what you
love." At one point, it seemed as if
another way to answer the question
of "Why study the humanities at
Stanford?" was simply, "So you can
do what you love." And I couldn't
help thinking that "Ah, so you're
doing what you love" albeit a re
sponse made with good intentions,
or simply out of habit held two
assumptions: first, that all humani
ties students love what they study
so much that money takes a distant
second, and second, that CS ma
jors, or those studying something
similarly marketable, don't enjoy
what they do, and are simply cogs
in the machine. A related third as
sumption is that humanities stu
dents who end up taking CS jobs
are "selling out."
Considering that the technology
industry is no cakewalk either, the
debate about whether a humanities
or CS major is "luckier" goes on.
The debate on why the humanities
should be studied will go on, too. I
realize that I have not answered
that question because the answers
are out there already: You become a
better critical thinker, reader and
writer, skills highly valued in any
industry; you are pushed to con
template human nature, which is
essentially the stuff of life. The im-
