### McKenzie Andrews 
During my freshman year, I was involved
with nothing besides hanging out in my
dorm. In high school I had jam-packed
my schedule with every extracurricular I could
find, and by the time I landed myself at Stan
ford, I was ready to chill out. I hadn't had much
free time in the years preceding my arrival on
the Farm, so I made a very conscious effort to
do nothing but "enjoy college," so to speak, my
freshman year.
That roughly translated to taking 13 units
freshman fall, overcompensating by taking 20
in the winter, and by the time it got to spring,
taking Spanish film studies classes that were
unlikely to count towards my degree, but did
involve watching a movie a week.
While I do admit that I dabbled in a variety
of campus activities, from my shaky tenure as
Cedro's intramural sports coordinator to at
tempting to make a habit of waking up for 8
a.m. triathlon practices, I honestly didn't get
involved with anything freshman year. I made
some great Mends derping around in my
freshman dorm, but I really didn't do anything
outside of it. Freshman me also had no idea
what I was majoring in. Lost in a sea of young
adult uncertainty, by spring quarter I had had
a lot of fun and had yet done nothing of note
thus far at Stanford.
Fast forward to spring rush: I decided to do
it. I'm not a super girly person, but as an ex
high school athlete, I figured it was worth
checking out whether I wanted to get involved
with a community of girls. All my closest high
school Mends had come from sports teams, and
since there are a lot of athletes at Stanford in
sororities, I wanted to give it a shot and see
whether I could meet more people than the ones
who just happened to live in my residence.
Let me just say, I'm glad I rushed, and it
was one of the worst experiences I've had at
Stanford.
As a girl who grew up with four brothers,
I'm not the best "girl-flirter" someone who
can make a few minutes of small talk with
women who don't really know or care about
you. On the first day you are whisked from
chapter to chapter where you will be judged

based on your appearance and the quality of
your three-minute interactions with various
sorority members. The entire process takes
around seven hours.
As a PNM (potential new member), first
impressions matter as chapters may see 400
girls on the first day and can only offer bids to
40. There is simply no equitable way to judge
that many women, so it can come down to who
knows whom, the roulette wheel of extremely
good first-impressions or simply how attrac
tive a PNM is. I recently learned the rush syn
onym for being extremely attractive is "pol
ished." This trait can up your desirability in
rush, because it's important for good-looking
sorority pictures.
Regardless of whether someone gets into
their number-one choice or decides to drop out
of rush after the first day, there are a wide va
riety of emotions that come at the end of the
process. Some girls get matched with a new
group of people who will play a huge role in
their collegiate social experience; others end
the process without a group at all. Because
we're Stanford students and generally pretty
awesome people, the inequity in the process
leads to great matches for some Mends and
disappointment for others. This is tine for
boys' and girls' rush experience, though the
boys get more free food and sometimes get to
smash things with their frats.
I'm so glad that I rushed, because my short,
meaningless conversations forced me to reflect
on my time thus far at Stanford and spurred
some introspection. Though I had done some
awesome things in the past, I realized that I
hadn't done anything I was particularly
proud of since coming to college. This
thought encouraged me to get involved with
some students groups (like The Daily!) that
have been excellent parts of my post-frosh life.
As someone writing from a non-Greek per
spective, I can honestly say that I'm extremely
glad to have rushed and perfectly happy to be
unaffiliated.
