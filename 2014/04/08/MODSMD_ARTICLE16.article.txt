# Are drones democratic?

### Aimee Trujillo 
It's clear that throughout the Obama ad
ministration, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,
more commonly known as drones, have
been at the forefront of debate on America's
national security and foreign policies.
I will first note that drone technology is
not new. While Obama has faced this debate
head-on, drones have been around since long
before he was elected into office in 2008. The
CIA had been flying unarmed surveillance
drones since 2000, and armed drones since
the Sept. 11,2001 terrorist attacks.
Unmanned drones are "piloted" by a crew
at a military base that analyzes the photo
graphic images sent back from the drones to
decide on an action to take. Essentially,
drones are controlled remotely, enabling
killing of individual targets that is almost
risk-free militarily and potentially automat
able. The military can send a remote-con
trolled drone to perform dangerous maneu
vers that would place an American life at risk
if attempted with more conventional meth
ods. President Obama defended his use of
drones in his 2013 speech on counterterror
ism by claiming that the alternatives spe
cial operations, conventional airpower or
missiles are much less precise and lead to
many more casualties than drone strikes.
With machines doing the dangerous and
dirty work of war for us, what could go
wrong? Analysts continually debate the effi
cacy and precision of drones, but the real
area in question should be the (lack of)
checks and balances on the use of drones.
The ease with which drones can be fired cre
ates a system lacking in emotional attach
ment, accountability and oversight. This is a
dangerous situation that undermines the
democratic institutions of checks and bal
ances in the United States.
Just this past week on April 3, the House
introduced a bipartisan bill entitled the "Tar
geted Lethal Force Transparency Act" to ad
dress the gaps in oversight of the current
U.S. drone policy. This legislation would in
crease the transparency of drone use by re
quiring a report on the number of combat

ants and civilians killed or injured in drone
strikes each year since 2008 and annual re
porting going forward.
This bill is the first step in the right direc
tion for U.S. military policy. It is a large im
provement upon the Department of Justice's
white paper on drones. This paper provided
a legal justification for potential future drone
strikes on an individual, even an U.S. citizen,
if the situation meets three criteria: the indi
vidual is an imminent threat of violent attack,
capture is not possible and U.S. action is con
sistent with the law of war.
However, what qualifies as an imminent
threat? Who determines the feasibility of
capture? Who makes these subjective deci
sions? The white paper clearly argues that
the President has the inherent right to "re
spond accordingly" to situations in any man
ner for the self-defense of the nation. The
document even further notes that "there ex
ists no appropriate judicial forum to evaluate
these constitutional consideration," because
in the view of the DOJ, national security is a
matter to be dealt with by the legislative and
executive branches. While effective drone
strikes must have the advantage of surprise,
the accountability of the government cannot
be sacrificed simply for the speed of re
sponse.
The ideas in this paper compromise the
system of checks and balances that the U.S.
is founded upon. Separation of power is cru
cial for preventing the corruption that so of
ten results with unlimited or unchecked pow
er. The new House bill, the "Targeted Lethal
Force Transparency Act," has the beginnings
of a better system of accountability. Requir
ing the government to report the number of
casualties resulting from drone strikes helps
"narrow the perception gap" between what
is reported or assumed, one of the creators of
the bill claims.
Up until now, there have been only esti
mates of deaths from drone strikes from or
ganizations such as Human Rights Watch
