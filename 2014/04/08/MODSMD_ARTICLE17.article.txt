# On drones and foreign policy
## 
### Anthony Ghosn 
There must have been a
brief moment in time, a
frozen second like a
glance at a swinging pendu
lum, when those who rooted
for freedom in the streets of
1789 Paris began to realize
that they had traded despot
for despot. And I'm sure that
those Chinese villagers who
expected peace and respect
from the Communist revolu
tion but got famine and
abuse instead shared this
feeling. Both revolutions
were idealism confronted by
reality, hope checked by de
pravity.
There was a time when
Americans could believe in
the exceptional nature of our
nation and in the unique and
"self-evident" protections of
our constitution. From the
sea of authoritarianism and
monarchy emerged a com
munity founded on revolu
tionary principles of the rule
of law and justice, one that
held the government ac
countable to the people and
not the other way around.
The more I learn about
the true state of our nation
and our foreign policy, the
more I begin to feel that
dark moment of clarity in
which one realizes that reali
ty is far uglier than one
hoped. And the more I learn,
the more I empathize with
that indescribable stillness
that occurs when a man or
woman realizes he or she is
fooled.

Perhaps the most em
blematic example of the con
tradiction between American
principles and actions is its
current drone policy. Our
new ability to send un

manned aircraft into areas of
conflict and execute enemies
from afar has permitted us
an incredible freedom to act.
Internally, there is currently
no public reporting mecha
nism to relate the number of
civilians or "enemy combat
ants" killed by drone strikes
around the world. Our gov
ernment has been freely ex
ercising its ability to murder
anyone anywhere in the
world. No habeas corpus, no
nothing.
In 2011, a 16-year-old
American citizen, Abdulra
ham Al-Awlaki, was sitting
with his father in Yemen
when a missile ended his
young life. By virtue of the
Constitution he was suppos
edly entitled to a just trial by
his peers, but this teenager
never had the chance of self
realization or independence.
Far from the peaceful hills of
Palo Alto, this is the reality
that many civilians face.
Drone strikes generally have
collateral damage, and in
many cases a mere associa
tion with someone on the
ClA's death list can be cause
for your murder. As for Ab
dulraham, advocates took his
case to court but nothing
came of the trial. His grand
father wrote a piece in The
New York Times last year
which claims that he has not
even heard from the Ameri
can government on the sub
ject of his grandson's death.
Our foreign policy is so
far from its original princi
ples that it has become un
clear whether we even have a
foreign policy at all. Vladimir
Putin has been dancing
around the inefficiency and

inconsistency of our foreign
policy machine since the
Snowden debacle. He picked
up that the American bark is
louder than its bite after the
Syrian red line controversy
and applied that lesson to his
invasion of Crimea. America
can strike nearly every
where, but it cannot enforce
its will everywhere, and as
the world moves towards
multi-polarity, the costs of
our foreign fumbles are go
ing to become greater and
greater.
What sets us apart from
other countries, however, is
that our population if not
our politicians genuinely
believe in the values es
poused by our constitution. I
also have faith that our
democracy is receptive to
change. Being American
means that we have a re
sponsibility to make sure
that we feed the bright light
that is the American experi
ment while being conscious
of the shadows our choices
create. Our drone policy is a
heck of a shadow.

It has become
unclear
whether we
even have a
foreign policy.
