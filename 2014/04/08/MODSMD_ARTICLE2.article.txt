# ASSU Executive slates debate policies, priorities
## Candidates discuss platforms at CoHo 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This year's three candidate
slates for ASSU Executive partici
pated in a pre-election debate on
Monday evening at the CoHo, in an
event that touched on topics rang
ing from how best to restore the
ASSU's credibility on campus to
the slates' contrasting priorities.
The three candidate slates
Elizabeth Woodson 'l5 and Logan
Richard 'l5, Lauren Miller 'l5 and
Geo Saba 'l5, and The Stanford
Chaparral's joke slate of Garrett
Taylor 'l5 and Colton Dempsey 'l6
were asked to give two-minute
responses to questions posed by
moderators representing The Daily
and The Stanford Review.
After introducing themselves,
the candidates first addressed how
they would work to restore the AS
SU's credibility with the student
body. Both credible slates argued
that "getting things done" and "do
ing what we say we're going to do"
would naturally rebuild the ASSU's
reputation. Both serious slates also
stated that they would strive to
promote awareness of the ASSU's
role among students, and particu
larly among freshmen.
Running on a platform of "fixing
what is broken and connecting
what already exists," Woodson also

talked about the structure of the
executive cabinet as something
they would strive to improve if
elected.
The slates were subsequently
asked to name pieces of past ASSU

legislation they did and did not sup
port.
"The judicial review process
was one I heard a lot about and that
I support," Woodson said, adding
that in terms of legislation, there

was not "something we were active
ly against."
While she characterized the cur
rent Executives' early attempts at
funding reform as "rushed," Miller
expressed her support of the SAFE

Reform bill, a piece of legislation
that aims to reform student activi
ties funding and that will be put be
fore the student body for approval
via the spring ballot.
She also praised the reestablish
ment of the Constitutional Council,
which Saba chaired this year. Saba
reiterated the importance of the
council and lauded the Undergrad
uate Senate's initiative to reserve
seats for upperclassmen within the
Senate.
"We're overwhelmingly sup
portive because what we're doing
right now just isn't working,"
Miller said, "[Stanford students]
are paying the highest student ac
tivities fee in the nation."
The debate then shifted focus to
the candidates' platforms. When
asked what plank of their platform
they thought was the most feasible,
Richard highlighted the "availabili
ty and accessibility of resources
pertaining to mental health."
Woodson said that breaking
down Stanford's culture of misper
ception with regards to mental
health issues was their top priority.
"I regret the ways I've handled
stress and the ways I have sought
help or not," Woodson said, reflect
ing on her Stanford experience, "I
believe that that is the reason that
we have now come to want to do
this work.
Miller and Saba mentioned the
need for more meeting and storage
space particularly for politically
oriented student groups
and the implementation of
an all-campus "day of ac
tion." They also emphasized
the importance of engaging
freshmen in ASSU pro
gramming and serving stu
dent groups through the an
ticipated passage of the
SAFE Reform measure.
Throughout the debate,
the Chaparral slate main
tained that, if elected, they
would ensure students' safe
ty on campus by among
other humorous proposals
hiring thugs as cabinet
members, taxing students,
passing compulsory helmet
policies and "balancing the
budget."
Taylor and Dempsey also
poked fun at the ASSU
throughout, arguing that it
ultimately "doesn't do any
thing."
