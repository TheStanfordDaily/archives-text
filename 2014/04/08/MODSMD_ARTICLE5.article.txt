## Students petition for professor's tenure 
### ALEX ZIVKOVIC DESK EDITOR 
Following the recent denial of
tenure to Assistant Professor of
English Stephen Sohn, a petition
calling on Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 and Dean of
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences Richard Sailer to reconsider
the School's decision has garnered

over 1,400 signatures including
those of several prominent Asian-
American authors and scholars
to date.
The argument
The petition, created by Debra
Pacio 'l5, argues for granting Sohn
tenure on several grounds, including
the potentially deleterious impact of
the loss of a minority faculty mem

ber in the humanities.
"With his imminent departure,
Stanford will lose one of its already
few Asian American Studies profes
sors, and we will continue having
barely any tenured Asian-American
faculty members in the humanities,"
wrote Annabeth Leow 'l6 in an
email urging people to sign the

Change.org petition.
The petition also voices
concern over the future of stu
dent research and education
at Stanford in Asian American
Studies.
"People who have com
mented on the petition are re
ally big people in Asian Amer
ican Studies," said Sunli Kim
'l5. "Which is why a lot of us
are like 'I don't think he would
have been evaluated as an
Asian-American scholar' be
cause clearly based on all of
the support he is getting from
the scholarly field and the lit
erature world he would have
probably passed so it must
have been as an American-ist
and then what are the implica
tions then?"
Students also singled out
Sohn's unique contribution to
the department. Beyond
drawing in Asian American
literature to English classes
on other topics a body of
work often not studied in
classes concerning narrative
theory Sohn often focuses
on the intersections between
Asian American Studies and
other academic disciplines.
"If you look at the kind of
classes professor Sohn is
teaching they demonstrate his
familiarity with so many dif
ferent fields he's taught a
seminar on trauma theory
so he is very familiar with the
psychoanalysis of trauma,"
Leow said. "He's taught a
class on gender and sexuality
in Asian-American literature
so there's that queer and fem
inist theory going on. He's
taught on transnational Asia
Pacific and transnationalism
and cosmopolitanism and di
aspora studies are also a dif
ferent field."
In a public Facebook post
that has since been shared
widely with the petition,
Thanh Nguyen 'l4 M.A. 'l4,
one of Sohn's advisees, chal
lenged the University's deci
sion by alleging that he was
evaluated purely for his schol
arship on more traditional
British and American literary
canon.
"Does the School of H&S
expect one of our few Asian-
American professors at Stan
ford to 'play the game' and
write thousands of pages

about dead white men, whose
literary value does not need
any more boosting?" Nguyen
wrote.

A shrinking department
For many of Professor
Sohn's supporters, his failure
to obtain tenure sheds light on
the struggling Asian Ameri
can Studies department,
which has few students and
fewer professors.
The denial follows on the
heels of last year's depart
ment town hall meeting, at
which the department dis
cussed the future of the major
with students, faculty and
alumni.
The Asian American Stud
ies department has two core
faculty members Professor
of Comparative Literature
David Palumbo-Liu and Pro
fessor of History Gordon
Chang M.A '72 Ph.D. 'B7
who sustain the program
alongside Professor of Educa
tion Anthony Antonio M.S.
'92, the program chair.
According to Kim, the de
partment held a meeting last
year to address how the major
and minor programs were de
creasing in popularity because
students weren't fully aware
of the program's offerings.
"There's also this cycle
that happens where because
there are such few faculty at a
time that are able to teach so
many classes in a year like,
it's a lot of work it's really
difficult to take the required
amount of classes and match
up those schedules according
to what you need in order to
graduate with that major or
minor," Kim said.
Many students noted that
the department might need a
more dependable rhythm of
classes if it hopes to continue.
Kim envisioned a worst-case
scenario in which the depart
ment's scholarship eventually
dies off at Stanford because of
its lack of visibility.
"Fewer students take
[Asian American Studies
classes] and therefore fewer
classes are offered and it just
becomes a vicious circle where
eventually in the end there
will be neither of either group
either professors or stu
dents," Kim said.
Students of ethnic studies
often encounter challenges
meeting course requirements
because of the specificity re
quired of their majors. For ex
ample, as a major in Compar-

ative Studies in Race and Eth
nicity (CSRE) major, one can
take classes that are listed un
der CSRE or classes that are
listed under these four other
majors in the CSRE depart
ment. However, if a student is
majoring in a specific subset,
like Asian American Studies
or Chicano/Latino Studies,
the majority of the required
classes must be listed within
those specializations.
"If you look at the course
list that is sent out at the start
of eveiy quarter there is a lot
less choice because there are a
lot fewer classes offered," Le
ow said.
One potential solution in
volves creating more classes
that are cross-listed across
multiple specializations.
Sohn's dismissal further deep
ens the issue given that many
of his classes were cross-list
ed, and according to Kim
few other professors have
courses that touch on issues
that would merit their cross
listing with Asian American
studies.
Another potential solution
calls on the department to
hire more professors. Cur
rently, the Asian American
Studies department relies
heavily on professors from
other universities to teach
classes here at Stanford.
"We've really been de
pending in a lot of Asian
American or Asian Studies fo
cused classes on taking pro
fessors from other schools
and other campuses to Stan
ford rather than creating
them here," Kim said.
With the shrinking depart
ment, the diminishing number
of resources for students in
the field is concerning as well.
Both Leow and Kim had
hoped to have Sohn serve as a
thesis advisor in the future,
and like several others are
seeking new advisors. Howev
er, these students have found
few professors that share
their research interests and
fewer that have time available
to dedicate to new students.

"So you're losing out on
these students who could have
gone on to produce more work

that will not be produced, so
it's not just one person or a
few people. It becomes cumu
lative," Leow said.

While the lack of resources
for students has broader im
plications for the future of the
field, Sohn's denial of tenure is
especially concerning given
the small number of profes
sors remaining in the depart
ment, according to students.
"When your two tenured
faculty professors have been
here for so long, there's no re
plenishment of talent going on
in the department," Leow
said. "If you're not putting
more people on that tenure
line into the tenured faculty,
where is this replacement go
ing to come from?"
Without tenure, Sohn is
only guaranteed to remain at
Stanford for another year.
