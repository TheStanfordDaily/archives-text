## Injuries plague Card as Arizona sweeps 
### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In spite of the significant adversity
that the Stanford softball team has con
tinued to deal with in the decimation of
its pitching rotation, the No. 24 Cardinal
have continued to fight against some of
the best teams in the country. Unfortu
nately for Stanford (24-14,1-8 Pac-12), it
was not enough against a talented Ari
zona (32-8, 7-5 Pac-12) team that was
buoyed by a vocal home crowd as the
Wildcats swept the Cardinal this week
end in Tucson, Ariz.
For supporters of the Stanford soft
ball program, the series against Arizona
played out in an eerily similar fashion to
the Cardinal's three-game set against
Arizona State in Tempe a few weeks ago.
More specifically, while the Wildcats
may have come away with the victories
in all three games, the Card had its
chances to pick up wins in all three con
tests. On Friday night, Stanford took a
12-8 lead into the bottom of the fifth in
ning, but an eight-run fifth for the Wild
cats ultimately doomed the Cardinal,
which fell by a final score of 18-12.
On Saturday night, Stanford was able
to jump out to a quick 2-0 lead on fresh
man Kylie Sorenson's two-run blast to
left-center field in the bottom of the first
inning. However, once again, Arizona re
sponded with another eight-run inning
in the bottom of the third, as the Cats
would run-rule the Card by a 12-3 mar
gin.
Finally, in the Sunday matinee, the
Cardinal nearly stunned the Wildcats
late, as freshman Bessie Noll absolutely
crushed the first delivery from Wildcat
