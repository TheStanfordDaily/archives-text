## Injuries plague Card as Arizona sweeps 
### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In spite of the significant adversity
that the Stanford softball team has con
tinued to deal with in the decimation of
its pitching rotation, the No. 24 Cardinal
have continued to fight against some of
the best teams in the country. Unfortu
nately for Stanford (24-14,1-8 Pac-12), it
was not enough against a talented Ari
zona (32-8, 7-5 Pac-12) team that was
buoyed by a vocal home crowd as the
Wildcats swept the Cardinal this week
end in Tucson, Ariz.
For supporters of the Stanford soft
ball program, the series against Arizona
played out in an eerily similar fashion to
the Cardinal's three-game set against
Arizona State in Tempe a few weeks ago.
More specifically, while the Wildcats
may have come away with the victories
in all three games, the Card had its
chances to pick up wins in all three con
tests. On Friday night, Stanford took a
12-8 lead into the bottom of the fifth in
ning, but an eight-run fifth for the Wild
cats ultimately doomed the Cardinal,
which fell by a final score of 18-12.
On Saturday night, Stanford was able
to jump out to a quick 2-0 lead on fresh
man Kylie Sorenson's two-run blast to
left-center field in the bottom of the first
inning. However, once again, Arizona re
sponded with another eight-run inning
in the bottom of the third, as the Cats
would run-rule the Card by a 12-3 mar
gin.
Finally, in the Sunday matinee, the
Cardinal nearly stunned the Wildcats
late, as freshman Bessie Noll absolutely
crushed the first delivery from Wildcat

starter E stela Pinon for a
home run to straightaway
center field to give the Car
dinal a 3-2 lead in the top of
the seventh inning. The lead
would not last, however, as
Arizona managed to first tie
the game in the bottom of
the seventh inning on an
RBI double, then walk off in
the bottom of the eighth in
ning on a two-run home run
to clinch a 5-3 win.
On offense, junior Erin
Ashby once again had a very
impressive weekend for the
Cardinal. The La Crescenta,
Calif, native was nearly un
stoppable at the plate in all
three games, as Ashby
recorded only one out over
the entire weekend while
hitting .600 and posting an
incredible .818 on-base per
centage.
Ashby also blasted two
home runs in the three
games in Tucson. Her home
run off of Arizona's E stela
Pinon helped the Cardinal
regain momentum in the top
of the second inning of Fri
day night's game after the
Wildcats jumped out to a 4-0
lead in the bottom of the first
on a Katiyana Mauga grand
slam.

"When you go up to the
plate, you just have to be dis
ciplined and look for good
pitches... when you get

those pitches, you have to
take advantage of them,"
Ashby said. "I think that was
my and a lot of other peo
ple's approaches this
weekend."
Ashby's strong showing
in Tucson continued an out
standing run of form for her
over the last month, as the
2011 High School All-Ameri
can is now hitting .347 on the
season with a .455 on-base
percentage and a .584 slug
ging percentage. Ashby has
also continued to provide
clutch hits with runners in
scoring position, batting .357
in those situations.
Freshman Kylie Soren
son also had a fabulous se
ries at the plate for the Car
dinal, as the Stevenson
Ranch, Calif, native led the
team with 6 RBIs while fin
ishing second to Ashby in
on-base percentage with a
.615 mark. In addition to her
home run on Saturday,
Sorenson had four more
RBIs in Friday night's offen
sive slugfest.
Posting a 3-for-5 per
formance against the Wild
cats in Friday's opener,
Sorenson had a 2-RBI single
in the top of the second and
following up that hit with
RBI singles in the third and
fifth innings. Sorenson's sin
gle in the second to center
field helped give the Cardi
nal a 5-4 lead, while the sin
gles in the third and the fifth
innings extended the Card's
advantage to 8-6 and 12-8,
respectively.

"I think everyone is do
ing everything they can,"
said Sorenson, describing
the team's start to Pac-12
play. "I think we are doing a
really great job in trying to
get that hit, walk, or putting
the ball in play...We have
gotten deep into games, with
so many extra-inning games,
so it's not as though we are
not challenging teams. It's
just that we're not finishing
games like the other teams
are."
"I think Madi [Schreyer]
is growing up. She is matur
ing in every outing in the cir
cle," said Stanford head
coach John Rittman about
the pitching moving for
ward. "We are going to con
tinue to work to improve in
all areas of our game. That is
what good teams do this
time of year. Although we
have had a tough go of it in
conference, there is still the
big picture of getting to the
postseason ... we have to
work on the little things that
are costing us games, and as
long as we continue to im
prove, we are going to be
okay."
The Cardinal will return
to action on Thursday, Fri
day and Saturday at home
against Washington. First
pitch on Thursday evening
will be at 8:00 p.m., while
both games on Friday and
Saturday will start at 7:00
p.m.
