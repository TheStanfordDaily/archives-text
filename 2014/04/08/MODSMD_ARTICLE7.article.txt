## More upperclass candidates seek election to Senate 
### ANDREW VOGELEY DESK EDITOR 
Following changes made earlier this year to the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate's rules, seven non
freshmen candidates will seek to become senators
on this year's spring ballot. By comparison, only
two non-freshman candidates ran last year.
Last year's election saw the passage of an
amendment to the ASSU Constitution mandating
that the Senate reserve some seats for upperclass
men. In January, the Senate passed legislation that
officially allocated three seats to upperclassmen,
provided the candidates meet certain require
ments.
The three "upperclass district" seats will be
filled if the three upperclassmen candidates re
ceive at least two-thirds the number of votes that
the 13th-place candidate received.
The remaining 12 seats are now considered "at
large" districts and can be filled by students from
any class. If three upperclassmen candidates are
among the top 15 in votes, the remaining upper
classmen candidates will not be elected by merely
receiving two-thirds of the votes the 13th place
candidate received. Instead, they will also have to
place in the top 15.
"I had hesitations last year about the approval
of an upperclassmen quota, but I think this [legis
lation] is a good compromise of preventing certain
upperclassmen of taking advantage of the amend
ment to make a mockery of the ASSU," said Sen
ator Zane Hellmann 'l6 to The Daily in January.
Some senators expressed concerns that simply
allocating three spots to upperclassmen candi
dates would not sufficiently address one of the un
derlying causes of the lack of upperclassmen in the
Senate the fact that Senators could not study
abroad while serving the ASSU.
"We decided that the abroad restriction tended
to preclude the 60 percent or so of students who
would be studying abroad at some point from being
on Senate," said Senator John-Lancaster Finley
'l6.
As a result, the Senate passed legislation that
removed a study-abroad restriction on senators.
The legislation allows first-term senators to go
abroad during the spring quarter at the end of
their term and returning senators to go abroad
during any quarter. If more than three senators
want to study abroad during any one quarter, the
senate chair determines who is allowed to study
abroad.
"We believe that removing the abroad restric
tion for spring quarter for first-time senators, and
for any quarter for returning senators, would do
[encourage upperclassmen] without gutting the
Senate of its knowledge, experience and potential
by having a ton of people off campus," Finley said.
