## Unforgettable year finishes in Final Four 
### Ashley Westhem 
Yesterday I left Nashville,
Tenn. and took my last
flight with the Stanford
women's basketball team
until next fall. My week
end in the Music City for the Final
Four was the perfect capstone for an
unforgettable season with an amaz
ing team.
People always ask me what I do
for the team I guess I don't look
like a player, even though I used to
be! Well, they're right: I'm not a play
er, but I'm one of the next-best
things: I am the voice of Stanford
women's basketball.
At the start of the year I knew I
would be traveling with the team, do
ing play-by-play for every game and
in charge of KZSU's coverage of the
team. I wasn't really sure what the
year would bring, especially come
winter quarter when I would be gone
almost every weekend.
I could never have predicted the
immense sense of accomplishment,
the pride for Nerd Nation, the re
spect for the players and the amazing
memories that would accompany the
season. I would have never guessed
how hard it would be to wrap up my
last broadcast of the season —or
that it would be at Bridgestone Are
na in the Final Four—wishing that
there could have been one more
game because I just love so much
feeling like a small part of the team.
Watching the team grow through
out the season at home in Maples
and on the road and having some
of those players become my friends
has been an experience hard to cap
toe in words.
I watched Lili Thompson become
an integral part of the Cardinal's ef
fort and a permanent part of the
stalling lineup. I watched Bonnie
Samuelson go from playing limited
minutes to being the first player off
the bench and then hardly ever taken
out again. I witnessed the immense
transformation of Mikaela Ruef from
a player on a great team last year, to
a player that makes the team great
this year. I witnessed the interactions
of the team and I was able to run in
to the locker room after they earned
a berth into the Final Four and have
them welcome me into their celebra
tion. All these experiences have left
me speechless.
Speechless is also a good way to
describe my feelings towards Chiney
Ogwumike. It's no secret that I am
Chiney's number one fan. I almost
died when she called me "homie" af
ter an interview. When Tara Van-
Derveer took her out of the game
against UConn because it was appar
ent that the Huskies had gotten the
best of the Cardinal once again, there
was probably a second of silence on
the air as I was rendered speechless.
It dawned on me that that that was
the last time I, or anyone else, would
get to see Chiney play with a red
block "S" on her chest. It was the last
time I would call a game that fea
tured the legendary Chiney Ogwu
mike.
And I can say legendary with cer
tainty. Chiney leaves the Farm as one
of the greatest athletes to ever com
pete in its colors. She accumulated
the most points and rebounds of any
Stanford player during her career,
surpassing the records of her sister
Nneka, of Candice Wiggins, of Jayne
Appel and of Jeanette Pohlen. I'll be
sure to brag about her more in my
feature on her career soon to come.
While traveling with the team this
season, I've gotten a taste of what it's
really like to be a student-athlete, ex
periencing the heavy toll of constant
road trips firsthand (we've been on
18 flights since January) and observ
ing the burdens and blessings of
playing a sport at Stanford.
As the voice of Stanford women's
basketball, I got to share my love of
basketball and of the team with other
Cardinal fans and I have also gained
invaluable experience for myself pro
fessionally that I can't imagine gain
ing anywhere else and I got to
travel to Nashville!
This weekend I got to sit court
side at the Final Four; I got to meet
one-on-one with ESPN analysts and
work side-by-side with writers from
ESPNW The New York Times and
The Washington Post. I want to have
a career in sports and for that to hap
pen, it's all about networking and
gaining experience. Covering such an
illustrious team, working with the
legendary Tara VanDerveer and pro
viding play-by-play for every game
this season has been priceless.
I am so thankful to have had the

opportunity to follow the run
of Stanford women's basket
ball into the Final Four and al
though I have to say goodbye
to four amazing seniors and
get to know three more fresh
men next year, I am already
looking forward to the 2014-
15 season and to finding out
who will be the next Stanford
great to follow Chiney.

Yesterday, I returned to
campus with the team for the
last time this year, closing a
chapter of my sophomore
year that has been unforget
table and one that no one else
can claim as their own.
