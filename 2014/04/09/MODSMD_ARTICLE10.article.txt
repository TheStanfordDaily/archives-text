## A 						chemical brain drain? 
### Holly Moeller 
Brains terrify me. There's a
reason I prefer to research
microbes. They've got a sin
gle cell (usually). They're massively
important to sustaining life on the
planet, but they're pretty simple to
understand as organisms.
Trying to figure out a brain, on
the other hand, seems to me like
asking for trouble.
The human brain is made up of
86 billion neurons, plus billions of
attendant cells. It uses 20 percent
of our energy. It controls our phys
ical movements, stores our memo
ries, and processes our thoughts.
I held a human brain once
lifted it out of a skull in a human
dissection. Cradling it carefully in
both hands, I marveled that this
three-pound organ once held the
essence of the deceased person be
fore me. It was a profound moment
in my scientific education.
But if the significance of the
adult human brain is awe-inspiring,
the balletic dance of the developing
brain is miraculous. It's precisely
choreographed by millennia of evo
lutionary optimization and directed
by a series of developmental sig
nals that somehow transform a ball
of cells into a thinking, functioning
human brain.

Brain development is a process
we still know little about. Yet its
complexity and delicacy suggest
that it may be susceptible to a vari
ety of derailments. So we instruct
women who may become pregnant
to chow down on folic acid supple
ments and warn expecting mothers
to eschew alcohol. New parents are
asked to stimulate their child's neu
rological development with conver
sation, reading, and educational
toys.
It's safe to say that baby brains
are important to us.
So why, then, do we let tens of
thousands of chemicals go untested
into the environment, when we
know that at least some of them
pose serious neurological threats?
That's the question that at least
some pediatricians are asking in
the face of mounting evidence of
the harmful side effects of some of
these chemicals.
More than two years ago, Dr.
David Bellinger of Harvard Med
ical School calculated that environ
mental toxins caused a loss of 40
million IQ points in a population of
just 25.5 million American children.
Since each IQ point is worth more
than $17,000 in lifetime earnings,
that figure equates to a total eco
nomic loss of almost $7OO billion.
And Bellinger's work analyzed
the neurological damage produced
by only three (methylmercury,
lead, and organophosphate pesti
cides) of potentially thousands of
toxic compounds.
Wait. Doesn't everyone know
about lead poisoning? And surely
people keep children away from
pesticides, right?
The answer to the first question
is yes, mostly, but only after
decades of accumulating evidence
finally convinced the Centers for
Disease Control to lower the advis
able limit of lead concentration in
children's blood.
As far as organophosphate pes
ticides go, many of them are fat-sol
uble. This means that once they en
ter the human body, they tend to
stay there, accumulating over time.
And one of their favorite places to
reside is in human breast tissue,
from where they ultimately make
their way into fat- and protein-rich
mother's milk, fed to suckling in
fants at some of their most vulnera
ble stages of brain development.
Should mothers stop breast
feeding?
Absolutely not, say healthcare
providers. The benefits to nutri
tion, to the immune system and be-

yond vastly outweigh the costs.
Yet it's nonetheless disturbing to
think that such an intimate and
pure act is now irrefutably marked
by the chemical signature of mod
ern times.
Breast milk contains traces of
hundreds of different chemicals
that permeate our everyday life. If
we are lucky most will prove harm
less. But an unlucky few, like lead,
will eventually prove to be carcino
gens or neurotoxins, and we will
wish, as with lead, that we'd caught
on earlier.
The way America's chemical
regulations are designed, it's un
likely we'll ever get ahead of the
game. Though the Toxic Sub
stances Control Act of 1976 re
quires that the Environmental Pro
tection Agency review all chemicals
imported to or manufactured in the
United States, only five of the
80,000 compounds regulated under
the Act have been banned. And
60,000 compounds were grandfa
thered in under the act, never to be
reviewed at all.
Attempts to reform the act lan
guish on Congressional backburn
ers. The latest attempt is a year
old, languishing in its efforts to rec
oncile industry lobbying with the
public good.
But ultimately, the problem with
regulation in hindsight is that the
burden of proof falls on regulators
after the chemicals have been in
troduced to our environment,
where they may remain in our very
bodies for decades. As long as we
embrace the promise of modern
chemistry and, indeed, it has
provided many miracles we will
continue to subject ourselves to its
darker shadow, often long after the
chemical brain drain has begun.
