# THE 						HUMANITIES IN THE 21ST CENTURY April 7-11, 2014
## How not to think about the humanities 
### David Palumbo-Liu 
Thinking about the hu
manities as a major
these days is a fraught
proposition. I won't lie to you
there is risk involved if you
are worried about employ
ment. Students at Stanford
are tremendously lucky
the University offers gener
ous financial aid packages; the
average amount of debt that
students graduate with is rel
atively low. Nonetheless, one
cannot avoid the fact that jobs
in most fields are hard to find.
The economic implosion of
2007, the result of a huge
moral and ethical failing (let's
be plain and call it reckless
ness and greed), has left last
ing seal's on generations who
do not have the luxury of not
thinking hard, long, and gut
wrenchingly about staying
alive economically.
Thomas Piketty's new
book, Capital in the 21st
Century, which has been
called "one of the watershed
books in economic thinking"
by Branko Milanovic of the
World Bank, amasses 200
years' of data to show the in
evitability of ever-increasing
economic inequality. The
plight of the 99-percent will
only grow larger. So in a terri
bly ironic sense students are
forced by this "market" to
abandon the humanities pre
cisely at a time when we need
the critical, introspective,
philosophical, aesthetic and
ethical judgment that the hu
manities nurture in us.
Let me make just two rec
ommendations to those who
are interested (in whatever
way) in the humanities, which
are indeed at the core of the
liberal arts education. (Re
member, that is what college
really is all about: It's really
not supposed to be a very ex
pensive career development
camp.)
First, do not think of the
humanities as an "either/or"
proposition. Diversify your
resume. Acquire a wide range
of skills and job experiences
that will make you legible to a
wide range of employers,

even as you pursue your hu
manities degree. Stanford's
new, pioneering Joint Major
programs with Computer Sci
ence plus Humanities depart
ments is a fantastic opportu
nity to pursue multiple inter
ests, but it is only one formal
example. Use your time here
to explore and create a selec
tion of courses.
Second, and more impor
tantly, do not confine your
perception of and involvement
with the humanities to the
classroom. At the last meeting
of the Modern Languages As
sociation, the largest profes
sional organization dedicated
to literary studies in the
world, there was a large open
meeting in which we dis
cussed how to help foster the
humanities in this time of cri
sis. One speaker after the oth
er made impassioned pleas
for partnering across institu
tions of higher education and
uniting with our public
schools.
I said that we were think
ing like educators, in terms of
classrooms and curricula and
professional connections. I
suggested that instead we
find partners with street
artists, musicians, local art
galleries, amateur theaters,
book clubs and all sorts of in
formal collectives where the
humanities do not have a
course number. Put crudely, I
think we have it backwards.
The humanities exist out
there in its most vibrant
forms. Here we just take it for
credit. And that is my pitch:
Don't think about the human
ities as packaged in classes,
syllabi. Don't "take" the class
for x number of units and then
cross off one or another distri
bution requirement. You may
be perfectly pleased at your
in-class experience, but it will
always appear in your memo
ry (assuming that it does) as a
class.

There are many scan
dalous things humanities
teachers are accused of: We
don't really do "research,"
we talk in vague theoretical

terms, we don't clock in the
hours our friends in the sci
ences do, hunched over their
lab tables and/or computers.
All true.
I confess that I put in a lot
of hours thinking —at odd
hours and in odd places
about what we call the hu
manities. But I suppose a
physicist sees phenomena all
around herself and reads
them in terms of the laws of
physics. And that's what hu
manists do. Let's put it this
way when one is in a hu
manistic frame of mind, one is
receptive and engaged in
looking at life through a dif
ferent lens, if even momentar
ily. One understands human
behavior and senses one's
own life in conversation with
the artists, writers, com
posers, performers, philoso
phers and historians that one
has had the privilege of being
in contact with, and whom
have been gifted with your at
tention and thoughtfulness.
Basically, we benefit from
learning how others have
dealt with proximate dilem
mas, desires, fears, joys and
problems, and in doing so we
feel a little less alienated, par
ticular and peculiar.
My prediction will be that,
given our deeply troubled and
newly precarious world, there
will be a huge resurgence in
the humanities. Maybe in
colleges, but certainly in new
ly revalued life styles. There
is only so much tolerance the
human spirit has for denying
itself the benefits of reflecting
on why and how we are alive
and live together.
I will end on a perhaps un
expected "political" note. As I
alluded to above, you are
thinking about these things
because you have been put in
a horrible position. As one fa
mous rock lyricist put it along
ago, "Lives become careers."
The humanities can, I think,
do at least two things as I
said above, they can help you
feel less lost and alienated in
this new historical moment,
and second, I hope, they can
help your generation ponder
the ethical issues that those
who got us into this mess
seemed to have all too suc
cessfully bypassed.
One image of the artist is
the lone idiosyncratic genius
set off from the world. I pre
fer the image Gabriel Garcia
Marquez puts forward in
One Hundred Years of
Solitude: that of the artist in
solidarity with humanity.

Thinking about the hu
manities as a major
these days is a fraught
proposition. I won't lie to you
there is risk involved if you
are worried about employ
ment. Students at Stanford
are tremendously lucky
the University offers gener
ous financial aid packages; the
average amount of debt that
students graduate with is rel
atively low. Nonetheless, one
cannot avoid the fact that jobs
in most fields are hard to find.
The economic implosion of
2007, the result of a huge
moral and ethical failing (let's
be plain and call it reckless
ness and greed), has left last
ing seal's on generations who
do not have the luxury of not
thinking hard, long, and gut
wrenchingly about staying
alive economically.
Thomas Piketty's new
book, Capital in the 21st
Century, which has been
called "one of the watershed
books in economic thinking"
by Branko Milanovic of the
World Bank, amasses 200
years' of data to show the in
evitability of ever-increasing
economic inequality. The
plight of the 99-percent will
only grow larger. So in a terri
bly ironic sense students are
forced by this "market" to
abandon the humanities pre
cisely at a time when we need
the critical, introspective,
philosophical, aesthetic and
ethical judgment that the hu
manities nurture in us.
Let me make just two rec
ommendations to those who
are interested (in whatever
way) in the humanities, which
are indeed at the core of the
liberal arts education. (Re
member, that is what college
really is all about: It's really
not supposed to be a very ex
pensive career development
camp.)
First, do not think of the
humanities as an "either/or"
proposition. Diversify your
resume. Acquire a wide range
of skills and job experiences
that will make you legible to a
wide range of employers,

even as you pursue your hu
manities degree. Stanford's
new, pioneering Joint Major
programs with Computer Sci
ence plus Humanities depart
ments is a fantastic opportu
nity to pursue multiple inter
ests, but it is only one formal
example. Use your time here
to explore and create a selec
tion of courses.
Second, and more impor
tantly, do not confine your
perception of and involvement
with the humanities to the
classroom. At the last meeting
of the Modern Languages As
sociation, the largest profes
sional organization dedicated
to literary studies in the
world, there was a large open
meeting in which we dis
cussed how to help foster the
humanities in this time of cri
sis. One speaker after the oth
er made impassioned pleas
for partnering across institu
tions of higher education and
uniting with our public
schools.
I said that we were think
ing like educators, in terms of
classrooms and curricula and
professional connections. I
suggested that instead we
find partners with street
artists, musicians, local art
galleries, amateur theaters,
book clubs and all sorts of in
formal collectives where the
humanities do not have a
course number. Put crudely, I
think we have it backwards.
The humanities exist out
there in its most vibrant
forms. Here we just take it for
credit. And that is my pitch:
Don't think about the human
ities as packaged in classes,
syllabi. Don't "take" the class
for x number of units and then
cross off one or another distri
bution requirement. You may
be perfectly pleased at your
in-class experience, but it will
always appear in your memo
ry (assuming that it does) as a
class.

There are many scan
dalous things humanities
teachers are accused of: We
don't really do "research,"
we talk in vague theoretical

terms, we don't clock in the
hours our friends in the sci
ences do, hunched over their
lab tables and/or computers.
All true.
I confess that I put in a lot
of hours thinking —at odd
hours and in odd places
about what we call the hu
manities. But I suppose a
physicist sees phenomena all
around herself and reads
them in terms of the laws of
physics. And that's what hu
manists do. Let's put it this
way when one is in a hu
manistic frame of mind, one is
receptive and engaged in
looking at life through a dif
ferent lens, if even momentar
ily. One understands human
behavior and senses one's
own life in conversation with
the artists, writers, com
posers, performers, philoso
phers and historians that one
has had the privilege of being
in contact with, and whom
have been gifted with your at
tention and thoughtfulness.
Basically, we benefit from
learning how others have
dealt with proximate dilem
mas, desires, fears, joys and
problems, and in doing so we
feel a little less alienated, par
ticular and peculiar.
My prediction will be that,
given our deeply troubled and
newly precarious world, there
will be a huge resurgence in
the humanities. Maybe in
colleges, but certainly in new
ly revalued life styles. There
is only so much tolerance the
human spirit has for denying
itself the benefits of reflecting
on why and how we are alive
and live together.
I will end on a perhaps un
expected "political" note. As I
alluded to above, you are
thinking about these things
because you have been put in
a horrible position. As one fa
mous rock lyricist put it along
ago, "Lives become careers."
The humanities can, I think,
do at least two things as I
said above, they can help you
feel less lost and alienated in
this new historical moment,
and second, I hope, they can
help your generation ponder
the ethical issues that those
who got us into this mess
seemed to have all too suc
cessfully bypassed.
