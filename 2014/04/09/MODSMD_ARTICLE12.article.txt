# The 						folly of humanities marketing at Stanford
## 
### Meredith Wheeler 
Historians are trained
to think of issues in
terms of change over
time, and if two key metrics
are considered the de
clining number of students
majoring in the humanities
and the skyrocketing num
ber of think pieces bemoan
ing the death of the human
ities then historians are
faced with a real puzzle.
What accounts for this
change over time, and more
importantly, should we as
humanists be concerned?
I believe that the human
ities are thriving at Stan
ford and elsewhere. They
are alive each time a stu
dent writes a poem, makes a
discovery in a historical
archive or thinks deeply
about how to be just and
ethical. In spite of this, it of
ten seems to me that Stan
ford administrators are un
certain as to what battle
they're fighting in their
quest to "resuscitate" the
humanities on campus.
I raise the problem of
metrics because I think that
it gets at a central issue that
plagues the discourse on the
undergraduate study of the
humanities: a lack of preci
sion in identifying what cri
sis humanities must be de
livered from. Does Stanford
want more humanities ma
jors and higher enrollments
in humanities classes? Does
it want to provide humani
ties majors with lucrative
postgraduation opportuni
ties? Does it want all of its
graduates to be thoughtful
and engaged citizens?
These goals, I believe, can
often be in tension with one
another, and until Stanford
is able to clearly articulate a
vision for the role of the hu
manities on campus, the ad
ministration's many praise
worthy initiatives aimed at
reviving humanities are
doomed to flounder.
In my time at Stanford,
I've been immersed of

ten involuntarily —in the
conversation over the fate
of the humanities, and in my
experience, the issue is of
ten flattened through two
pernicious assumptions.
The first is that students
are instrumental that
they make their choice of
major based on some expec
tation of future return. The
second is that the humani
ties problem is inherently a
numbers issue, and it fol
lows that Stanford should
utilize expansion as an or
ganizing principle for its hu
manities initiatives. I be
lieve both of these assump
tions are deeply flawed and
antithetical to the reality of
the student experience
within the humanities.
The instrumentalist as
sumption is born out every
time a Stanford administra
tor says a version of the fol
lowing: "You can major in
the humanities and work at
Google, too!" This line,
while well-meaning, is ulti
mately an ineffective pitch.
First, and perhaps most ob
viously, it narrowly implies
that the end goal of a Stan
ford education is employ
ment in the technology sec
tor, regardless of under
graduate preparation. Sec
ond, while many Stanford
students do consider future
employment prospects
when selecting an under
graduate major, I believe
there is simply no way to
make the senior year job
market concrete when
pitching the humanities to a
freshman or sophomore.
The Google pitch
while accurate and facially
uncontroversial —is more
platitude than substance,
trying simultaneously to ap
peal to students' instrumen
tal instincts while also disin
genuously ignoring the in
strumental reality: an engi
neering degree from Stan
ford will, on average, pay
more over one's lifetime

than a degree in the human
ities. That fact is unlikely to
change. So why are Stan
ford administrators still
trying to pitch the humani
ties on instrumental terms?
More jarring is the con
fusion that persists at all
levels of the administration
over the question of expan
sion. It is incredible to me
that just two years removed
from the last IHUM cohort,
there is still a sense that the
humanities should be a
large scale enterprise on
campus. I believe strongly
that IHUM failed not be
cause students were disen
gaged but because a 200-
student lecture hall very
rarely provides an effective
format for the engagement
students crave. In seeking
to expand the humanities, I
fear that Stanford may un
dermine the intellectual en
vironment that is, for me, a
core component of why stu
dents love humanistic in
quiry.
In my own experience, I
chose to major in history
because I wanted a particu
lar kind of academic experi
ence, one that would take
me out of large lecture halls
and into intimate seminars
where intellectual engage
ment was the rule, not the
exception. Not incidentally,
I also loved learning about
the past, in much the same
way that I imagine civil en
gineers feel drawn to their
discipline because they love
structural puzzles. In com
municating what the hu
manities are and why they
matter, I believe that Stan
ford must appeal to stu
dents' curiosities and to
their hunger for intellectual
engagement rather than to
the abstraction of pay
checks three to four years
in the future.
Put simply, the question
has it wrong: at Stanford, it
is the humanities that are
present and concrete, and it
is the idea of earning poten
tial that is ultimately nebu
lous. To tell a Stanford fresh
man that he should major in
English because he can use it

to write content at Pinterest
in 2020 will always be a weak
proposition; but to tell him he
should major in English be
cause he can hone his writing
in a 10-person seminar with
the former Poet Laureate of
the United States is a prem
ise ripe with possibility. The
humanities at Stanford are
alive because students are
alive because we seek to
create and consume beauty,

to communicate ideas and to
understand that which is
both frightening and differ
ent. It is in this present,
rather than in an abstract
and uncertain future, that
the humanities can and will
be revived.

it want to provide humani
ties majors with lucrative
postgraduation opportuni
ties? Does it want all of its
graduates to be thoughtful
and engaged citizens?
These goals, I believe, can
often be in tension with one
another, and until Stanford
is able to clearly articulate a
vision for the role of the hu
manities on campus, the ad
ministration's many praise
worthy initiatives aimed at
reviving humanities are
doomed to flounder.
In my time at Stanford,
I've been immersed of

ten involuntarily —in the
conversation over the fate
of the humanities, and in my
experience, the issue is of
ten flattened through two
pernicious assumptions.
The first is that students
are instrumental that
they make their choice of
major based on some expec
tation of future return. The
second is that the humani
ties problem is inherently a
numbers issue, and it fol
lows that Stanford should
utilize expansion as an or
ganizing principle for its hu
manities initiatives. I be
lieve both of these assump
tions are deeply flawed and
antithetical to the reality of
the student experience
within the humanities.
The instrumentalist as
sumption is born out every
time a Stanford administra
tor says a version of the fol
lowing: "You can major in
the humanities and work at
Google, too!" This line,
while well-meaning, is ulti
mately an ineffective pitch.
First, and perhaps most ob
viously, it narrowly implies
that the end goal of a Stan
ford education is employ
ment in the technology sec
tor, regardless of under
graduate preparation. Sec
ond, while many Stanford
students do consider future
employment prospects
when selecting an under
graduate major, I believe
there is simply no way to
make the senior year job
market concrete when
pitching the humanities to a
freshman or sophomore.
The Google pitch
while accurate and facially
uncontroversial —is more
platitude than substance,
trying simultaneously to ap
peal to students' instrumen
tal instincts while also disin
genuously ignoring the in
strumental reality: an engi
neering degree from Stan
ford will, on average, pay
more over one's lifetime

than a degree in the human
ities. That fact is unlikely to
change. So why are Stan
ford administrators still
trying to pitch the humani
ties on instrumental terms?
More jarring is the con
fusion that persists at all
levels of the administration
over the question of expan
sion. It is incredible to me
that just two years removed
from the last IHUM cohort,
there is still a sense that the
humanities should be a
large scale enterprise on
campus. I believe strongly
that IHUM failed not be
cause students were disen
gaged but because a 200-
student lecture hall very
rarely provides an effective
format for the engagement
students crave. In seeking
to expand the humanities, I
fear that Stanford may un
dermine the intellectual en
vironment that is, for me, a
core component of why stu
dents love humanistic in
quiry.
In my own experience, I
chose to major in history
because I wanted a particu
lar kind of academic experi
ence, one that would take
me out of large lecture halls
and into intimate seminars
where intellectual engage
ment was the rule, not the
exception. Not incidentally,
I also loved learning about
the past, in much the same
way that I imagine civil en
gineers feel drawn to their
discipline because they love
structural puzzles. In com
municating what the hu
manities are and why they
matter, I believe that Stan
ford must appeal to stu
dents' curiosities and to
their hunger for intellectual
engagement rather than to
the abstraction of pay
checks three to four years
in the future.
Put simply, the question
has it wrong: at Stanford, it
is the humanities that are
present and concrete, and it
is the idea of earning poten
tial that is ultimately nebu
lous. To tell a Stanford fresh
man that he should major in
English because he can use it

to write content at Pinterest
in 2020 will always be a weak
proposition; but to tell him he
should major in English be
cause he can hone his writing
in a 10-person seminar with
the former Poet Laureate of
the United States is a prem
ise ripe with possibility. The
humanities at Stanford are
alive because students are
alive because we seek to
create and consume beauty,

to communicate ideas and to
understand that which is
both frightening and differ
ent. It is in this present,
rather than in an abstract
and uncertain future, that
the humanities can and will
be revived.

Historians are trained
to think of issues in
terms of change over
time, and if two key metrics
are considered the de
clining number of students
majoring in the humanities
and the skyrocketing num
ber of think pieces bemoan
ing the death of the human
ities then historians are
faced with a real puzzle.
What accounts for this
change over time, and more
importantly, should we as
humanists be concerned?
I believe that the human
ities are thriving at Stan
ford and elsewhere. They
are alive each time a stu
dent writes a poem, makes a
discovery in a historical
archive or thinks deeply
about how to be just and
ethical. In spite of this, it of
ten seems to me that Stan
ford administrators are un
certain as to what battle
they're fighting in their
quest to "resuscitate" the
humanities on campus.
I raise the problem of
metrics because I think that
it gets at a central issue that
plagues the discourse on the
undergraduate study of the
humanities: a lack of preci
sion in identifying what cri
sis humanities must be de
livered from. Does Stanford
want more humanities ma
jors and higher enrollments
in humanities classes? Does
it want to provide humani
ties majors with lucrative
postgraduation opportuni
ties? Does it want all of its
graduates to be thoughtful
and engaged citizens?

often be in tension with one
