# Your own kindling: finding happiness within ourselves
## 
### Mark Flores 
The following piece is a response
to Ajit Vakharia's April 2 piece
"Embracing Compassion against
Mortality."
In his article, Ajit told the story of
his late brother and of the torch Ajit
now carries: how, in his brother's words,
"My happiness depends on the
happiness of those around me."
This is a compassionate ideal, but
it's far more dangerous than it
sounds. Ajit notes that "happiness
cannot be found within one's own bub
ble," but I must disagree.
I sympathize with Ajit's intentions
and I respect Ajit not only for his
courage, but also as someone who lived
in the same freshman dorm as him. But
just as Ajit felt a need to share, I, too,
feel a similar need. I also want to pass
on what I've learned.
Chiefly, we must learn that happi
ness is a gesture from within, not an ex
ternal outcome, and that before we can
effectively show compassion to others,

we must show compassion to ourselves.
I reject the notion that "Our confi
dence in our own individuality is
not just unproductive. It is coun
terproductive" because for me, it has
always been the other way around.
This story begins in my childhood,
when I first began navigating the idea
laden hurricane that was television, and
the takeaway was to put your friends
first. Your friends are everything. In
other words, "my happiness de
pends on the happiness of those
around me." For the first 19 years of
my life, this principle was something
that I internalized.
Sparing the details, I ended up un
happy after my freshman year, without
any sense of self-validation a feeling
that persisted till this year. To illustrate,
I would spend hours at my desk, start
ing at nothing, ruminating on the fact
that no matter what I did for others, I
was unhappy. I would be kind, singing
compliments like they were my lifeline,
smiling at every opportunity and pre
tending it was genuine. At that point, I

was willing to give all my time to others
without realizing how feeble my efforts
must have been when I myself had little
to give. Compassion and happiness are
related, but ultimately different, states
of being. The expression of compassion
to others alone is simply not enough to
lead towards happiness.
There were two things that allowed
me to exit the depths of my struggle.
The first one was a lesson from a friend.
He had noted that over the summer, he
learned how to eat alone to enjoy his
own company. And he was happier for
it.
The second was when I started go
ing to CAPS. My psychiatrist explained
to me that it was not fair for me to base
my own happiness off the happiness of
others. The constant rocking and un
steadiness and the loss of agency over
my feelings were unfair. Unfair. And
with this word, I was able to let this self
destructive need to make others happy
at all costs go.
