# Life lessons in liberation: El Salvador over spring break
## 
### Cole Manley 
This past quarter, I had
the privilege of taking
an unorthodox course
called "Issues in Liberation:
El Salvador." Over 10 weeks,
we learned about the culture
and politics of El Salvador, a
nation whose history is
bloodily intertwined with
that of the United States. In
terdisciplinary by nature,
the course approached El
Salvador through history,
liberation theology, develop
ment issues, immigration de
bates, films and guest lec
tures by Salvadorans.
Led by Professors
Thomas Sheehan, Kathleen
Coll and United Campus
Christian Pastor Geoff
Browning, the course culmi
nated with a nine-day trip to
El Salvador over spring
break. We explored the capi
tal city, San Salvador, talked
to an indigenous youth
leader, home-stayed with
farming communities and
marveled at the mangrove
forests these communities
protect. Throughout our trip,
we reflected on what we
were learning as a group and
individually. Since returning,
I have thought more about
my experience.
This kind of hands-on
course should be Ã¼biquitous,
not unique, at Stanford.
Learning is a process that
extends far beyond the four
walls of a classroom. Time
learning does not come from
what one memorizes in a li
brary or lecture series, but
through discussion and de
bate both inside and outside
the classroom. By incorpo
rating traditional lectures,
seminar-style discussion and
even a Skype interview with
former U.S. Ambassador to
El Salvador Robert White,
the course made us rethink,
question and complicate our
readings and discussions.
Going into El Salvador, we
had a more nuanced view of
the country.
Yet even though we came
into the country with this
background, the practical ex
perience of going to El Sal

vador was richer than any
one in the course could have
imagined. The trip to El Sal
vador allowed us to learn
from people who lived
through the bloody civil war
from 1980 to 1992. The war
continues in the memories of
Salvadorans, and in fact our
country played a significant
role in it.
Throughout the war, the
U.S. financed and trained
government death squads
which repressed the resist
ance movement of the
Farabundo Marti National
Liberation (FMLN) front. In
our conversations with Sal
vadorans, it was clear that
the war is very much still re
membered and present. At a
Christian base community
we visited base communi
ties are small villages where
Christian masses are entire
ly democratic; there is no
Church hierarchy, and
women lead many of the
masses the walls of the
Church were covered with
pictures of martyrs from the
war. In no way could read
ings about the war have pre
pared me for the images that
these Salvadoran communi
ties memorialize, and the ex
perience of seeing how they
remember it was invaluable.
We also had the privilege
to talk with students like
ourselves. A youth indige
nous leader named Jose
spoke about the importance
of "living well." Contrary to
the predominant Western
mindset, living well does not
mean one has to have money.
Unlike some of his peers who
try to escape their indige
nous roots by going to San
Salvador or to the United
States, Jose is committed to
improving his indigenous
community.
Jose does not have much
money, but he is content. He
wants to return to his com
munity after college and
farm the land. Jose admitted
that his siblings are studying
to leave the community,
probably with dreams of
climbing the socio-economic
ladder, and that they do not
understand his motivations.
I admired his plan to live
well without living rich, and
I think that this is a lesson
all of us at Stanford could do
well to remember.
Going to El Salvador
made me reflect on my own
education. Stanford prides
itself on its interdisciplinary
courses, talented professors,
and award-winning re
search. To be sure, this
course was led by three of its
most dedicated and passion
ate instructors. Yet in no
way could they have pre
pared me for what I was to
learn by simply listening to
Salvadorans, traveling

around the country and
soaking up its politics and
history. I hope you get a
chance to have this kind of
experience during your four
years here as well.
If you are interested
in learning more about
this course and experi
ence, join us on April
13th as we present a re
port to the Stanford com
munity about our trip.
There will be some excel
lent Salvadoran food to
enjoy! Also, contact Ge

Come next fall, contact
Geoff to get an applica
tion for the course.

Cole Manley is a junior at
Stanford majoring in Histo
ry. He is still dreaming
about El Salvador. Contact
