## EIGHTH INNING REVIVAL 
### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
Despite an uncharacteristically
poor pitching performance and
some defensive miscues, Stanford's
baseball team (11-14, 3-6 Pac-12)
averted disaster on TUesday night
with a 7-6 comeback victory over
UC-Davis (14-15, 1-5 Big West). It
was the Cardinal offense that
bailed the team out, scoring three
runs in with two outs in the bottom

to a 7-6 advantage.

Junior Dominic Jose, who en

for-17) with one RBI on the season,
stepped up in the eighth against
UC-Davis freshman reliever Zach

from the bullpen. He lined the first
pitch he saw down the right-field
line for a double, scoring sopho
more Zach Hoffpauir and junior
Wayne Taylor to tie the game at six.
"I wanted to get something up
in the zone because I wanted to get
a good swing on it, knowing that we
were down two," Jose said. "He
threw me a fastball up, and I
thought, 'This is it. I have to take
my best swing at this one.' I hit it

good and just started running."
The double was part of a 3-for-4
day for the Boca Raton, Fl. native,
a performance that has been a long
time coming given his early-season
struggles.
"I've been working so hard in
the cages. It's been more mentally
than anything because I know the
straggles of getting off to a slow
start," Jose said. "But you have to
