## EIGHTH INNING REVIVAL 
### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
Despite an uncharacteristically
poor pitching performance and
some defensive miscues, Stanford's
baseball team (11-14, 3-6 Pac-12)
averted disaster on TUesday night
with a 7-6 comeback victory over
UC-Davis (14-15, 1-5 Big West). It
was the Cardinal offense that
bailed the team out, scoring three
runs in with two outs in the bottom

of the eighth to turn a 6-4 deficit in
to a 7-6 advantage.

Junior Dominic Jose, who en
tered the game hitting just .118 (2-
for-17) with one RBI on the season,
stepped up in the eighth against
UC-Davis freshman reliever Zach

Stone, who had just been called in
from the bullpen. He lined the first
pitch he saw down the right-field
line for a double, scoring sopho
more Zach Hoffpauir and junior
Wayne Taylor to tie the game at six.
"I wanted to get something up
in the zone because I wanted to get
a good swing on it, knowing that we
were down two," Jose said. "He
threw me a fastball up, and I
thought, 'This is it. I have to take
my best swing at this one.' I hit it

good and just started running."
The double was part of a 3-for-4
day for the Boca Raton, Fl. native,
a performance that has been a long
time coming given his early-season
struggles.
"I've been working so hard in
the cages. It's been more mentally
than anything because I know the
straggles of getting off to a slow
start," Jose said. "But you have to

Sophomore right fielder Zach Hoffpauir (above) went 2-for-4 with a homer in Stanford's 7-6 comeback win over UC-Davis on Tuesday night.
The Cardinal's seven runs in the game were the team's most since it scored 11 runs at California on March 4 a span of 12 games.
believe in yourself. Coming out to
day and being able to help the team
with this big comeback win is what
it's all about."
"He struggled early, and it's
tough for a switch-hitter," said head
coach Mark Marquess. "But he's
done a great job. He got in the line
up against Oregon State and hit the
ball hard, and obviously had a big
hit for us [tonight]."
Junior Brant Whiting, pinch-hit
ting for sophomore shortstop Drew
Jackson, followed Jose's double with
an RBI single of his own on an 0-2
count, giving the Cardinal the lead,
which junior Sam Lindquist protect
ed in the top of the ninth.
But it was the team's pitching
that put Stanford in a hole to begin
with, as Marquess' decision to pitch
by committee in order to save arms
turned out to be tougher than antici
pated. The Cardinal tied a season
high by surrendering nine walks and
also hit three batsmen.
"We've been pitching so well,
throwing a lot of strikes and not
walking a lot of people, but we didn't
do that tonight," Marquess said. "It
was out of character for us. We gave
them too much and they took ad
vantage and got a couple of big
hits."
Freshman Tyler Thorne, who
last appeared for the Cardinal on
Mar. 30 against Oregon in a score
less inning of relief, had a strong, al
beit abbreviated start. Over three
innings pitched, he allowed one run
despite not giving up a hit against
the Aggies on a leadoff walk to Ag
gie senior Spencer Brann in the top
of the third, who advanced on a wild
pitch and a groundout and went on

to score on a fielder's choice.
But from there, the Stanford
bullpen allowed runs in each of the
next four innings, spurred by con
trol problems and some shoddy de
fense, including an error by senior
second baseman Brett Michael Do
ran with two outs in the bottom of
the seventh that provided UC-
Davis with an insurance run.
The Cardinal offense was just
enough to overcome the poor pitch
ing, as the seven runs scored in the
game was its most since March 4 at
Cal a 12-game span. It was also
the team's first multi-home run
game since the third game of the
season against Rice, as junior third
baseman Alex Blandino went 1-for
-4 with a homer and Hoffpauir went
2-for-4 with a homer of his own.
"Our pitching has been great, es
pecially last weekend, so you can't
expect that every single game,"
Jose said. "[Tonight's performance
was] big for the bats for the guys
in the lineup to get some confidence.
It's big for them going forward
against teams like Washington this
weekend."
Stanford's series in Seattle

The Cardinal offense was just
enough to overcome the poor pitch
ing, as the seven runs scored in the
game was its most since March 4 at
Cal a 12-game span. It was also
the team's first multi-home run
game since the third game of the
season against Rice, as junior third
baseman Alex Blandino went 1-for
-4 with a homer and Hoffpauir went
2-for-4 with a homer of his own.
"Our pitching has been great, es
pecially last weekend, so you can't
expect that every single game,"
Jose said. "[Tonight's performance
was] big for the bats for the guys
in the lineup to get some confidence.
It's big for them going forward
against teams like Washington this
weekend."

Despite an uncharacteristically
poor pitching performance and
some defensive miscues, Stanford's
baseball team (11-14, 3-6 Pac-12)
averted disaster on TUesday night
with a 7-6 comeback victory over
UC-Davis (14-15, 1-5 Big West). It
was the Cardinal offense that
bailed the team out, scoring three
runs in with two outs in the bottom

of the eighth to turn a 6-4 deficit in
to a 7-6 advantage.

Junior Dominic Jose, who en
tered the game hitting just .118 (2-
for-17) with one RBI on the season,
stepped up in the eighth against
UC-Davis freshman reliever Zach

Stone, who had just been called in
from the bullpen. He lined the first
pitch he saw down the right-field
line for a double, scoring sopho
more Zach Hoffpauir and junior
Wayne Taylor to tie the game at six.
"I wanted to get something up
in the zone because I wanted to get
a good swing on it, knowing that we
were down two," Jose said. "He
threw me a fastball up, and I
thought, 'This is it. I have to take
my best swing at this one.' I hit it

good and just started running."
The double was part of a 3-for-4
day for the Boca Raton, Fl. native,
a performance that has been a long
time coming given his early-season
struggles.
"I've been working so hard in
the cages. It's been more mentally
than anything because I know the
straggles of getting off to a slow
start," Jose said. "But you have to

Sophomore right fielder Zach Hoffpauir (above) went 2-for-4 with a homer in Stanford's 7-6 comeback win over UC-Davis on Tuesday night.
The Cardinal's seven runs in the game were the team's most since it scored 11 runs at California on March 4 a span of 12 games.

day and being able to help the team
with this big comeback win is what
it's all about."
"He struggled early, and it's
tough for a switch-hitter," said head
coach Mark Marquess. "But he's
done a great job. He got in the line
up against Oregon State and hit the
ball hard, and obviously had a big
hit for us [tonight]."
Junior Brant Whiting, pinch-hit
ting for sophomore shortstop Drew
Jackson, followed Jose's double with
an RBI single of his own on an 0-2
count, giving the Cardinal the lead,
which junior Sam Lindquist protect
ed in the top of the ninth.
But it was the team's pitching
that put Stanford in a hole to begin
with, as Marquess' decision to pitch
by committee in order to save arms
turned out to be tougher than antici
pated. The Cardinal tied a season
high by surrendering nine walks and
also hit three batsmen.
"We've been pitching so well,
throwing a lot of strikes and not
walking a lot of people, but we didn't
do that tonight," Marquess said. "It
was out of character for us. We gave
them too much and they took ad
vantage and got a couple of big
hits."
Freshman Tyler Thorne, who
last appeared for the Cardinal on
Mar. 30 against Oregon in a score
less inning of relief, had a strong, al
beit abbreviated start. Over three
innings pitched, he allowed one run
despite not giving up a hit against
the Aggies on a leadoff walk to Ag
gie senior Spencer Brann in the top
of the third, who advanced on a wild
pitch and a groundout and went on

to score on a fielder's choice.
But from there, the Stanford
bullpen allowed runs in each of the
next four innings, spurred by con
trol problems and some shoddy de
fense, including an error by senior
second baseman Brett Michael Do
ran with two outs in the bottom of
the seventh that provided UC-
Davis with an insurance run.
