# FOOTBALL NOTES
## CARD'S SPECIAL TEAMS SHINE 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Despite a dominant defense
and a thunderous running game,
Stanford football's most successful
unit last season might have been
its special teams.
Some of the most lasting mem
ories and most important plays
from the 2013-14 season came
when the kickoff or punt teams
lined up on the field. Against
Washington, junior Ty Mont
gomery caught the opening kick
off and raced 99 yards untouched
for a touchdown in what would
eventually be a 3-point victory for
Stanford. Additionally, against
Arizona State, senior Blake Lued
ers and sophomore Luke Kaumat
ule demolished the Sun Devils'
protection and teamed up to stuff
a punt, blocking it back into the
end zone for a safety.
As a kick returner, Mont
gomery led the nation last season
with a 30.3 yards-per-kick-return
average and two kick return
touchdowns, consistently deliver
ing the big play when Stanford
needed it.
Not only did the special teams
unit impress with big plays, but it
also superbly executed the funda
mental and severely underappre
ciated aspects of special teams
kick and punt return coverage.
Stanford's 42.5 net yards per kick
off ranked first in the Pac-12, while
its 38.5 net yards per punt ranked
fourth, indicating both strong
kicking and stellar coverage that
prevented opponents from regain
ing yardage on the returns.
Senior kicker Jordan
Williamson also finished fifth in
the conference in field goal per
centage and senior punter Ben
Rhyne finished second in yards
per punt. Both specialists will re
turn next season for their fifth
years.
"If we play like we did last sea
son, we'll be good," said
Williamson about the kicking
group. "We'll all be a little more
experienced so our performance
should be that much better. We're
ah looking forward to bringing the
unit back together and it's not like
anyone's moving around or there's
new guys or new pieces."
After a breakout junior year in
2012 that saw him deliver the
game-winning field goal in over
time against Oregon, Williamson
battled injuries for much of last
season and was limited to kicking
field goals after he returned, with

sophomore kicker Conrad
Ukropina kicking off.
"It was frustrating,"
Williamson said. "But ultimately,
you get to see things from a differ
ent point of view. It's a humbling
experience. You realize that your
time on the field isn't guaranteed
and that something can happen, so
it really makes you that much
more motivated and gives you a
little bit more drive to get back
and stay healthy and do some pre
ventive things in the future just to
be good and continue on with your
career."
Even with the injuries,
Williamson still finished 18-for-22
on field goals, including a 4-for-5
performance against Oregon. Now
fully healthy and not limited in
spring practice, Williamson is con
tinuing to focus on improving for

next season.
"Obviously, you want things to
be the exact same every single
time as a kicker so it's really just
working on consistency and con
tinuing to get where I need to be,"
he said.
Although it saw success in
nearly every facet of its special
teams, Stanford may hope for the
most improvement this season in
punt returns. The team finished
sixth in the Pac-12 with 8.2 yards
per punt return last season.
The man who may provide the
biggest lift for the Cardinal this
season in their punt return game
is sophomore running back Barry
Sanders. Last season, Sanders fin
ished with 71 yards on seven punt
returns, including a team-high 29-

Sophomore running back Barry Sanders (above), who returned
seven punts last season for a total of 71 yards, has emerged in recent
practices as a leading candidate to return punts next season.
