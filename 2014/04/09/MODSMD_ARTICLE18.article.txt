## Cal Poly surge silenced Homestand starts with tough victory 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
After a tough road trip to
Southern California in which it suf
fered consecutive losses for the
first time this season, No. 43 Stan
ford men's tennis (10-4,2-2 Pac-12)
returned home on Tuesday and
kicked off the final homestand of
its season with a bounce-back 4-2
victory over Cal Poly (7-12).
On a beautiful day at Taube
Family Tennis Stadium, the Cardi
nal took care of the doubles point
in short order with an 8-1 victory
on court one from their top doubles
pair of senior Daniel Ho and junior
Robert Stineman and a solid 8-3
win on court three from sophomore
Nolan Paige and freshman Yale
Goldberg.
Although junior John Morris
sey and senior Jamin Ball ran into
a more significant challenge as
they faced Cal Poly's second-seed
ed doubles pairing on court two,
the other two Stanford pairs quick
ly dispatching their competition
meant that the final doubles match
did not need to proceed to comple
tion and was abandoned with the
score tied at 6-6.

The Mustangs put up a more
substantial fight in the singles
matches, as sophomore Anthony
Tsodikov was the only Cardinal
player able to emerge with a quick
first-set victory with his 6-3 score.
Meanwhile, Morrissey, sophomore
Trey Strobel and Paige were all
forced into tight first-set tiebreaks
on courts one, three and four, re
spectively. Unfortunately for the
Cardinal, all three went point-for
point with their opponents but
eventually cracked at the tail ends
of hard-fought sets as Cal Poly
players took all three tiebreaks for
a trio of 7-6 first-set wins.

Meanwhile, on court five,
Tsodikov finished up a straight-set
victory with a 7-5 second-set mark
over Cal Poly senior Matt Thom
son to conclude the first singles
match of the afternoon as Morris
sey was just getting underway
