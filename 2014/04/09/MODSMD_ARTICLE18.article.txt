## Cal Poly surge silenced Homestand starts with tough victory 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
After a tough road trip to
Southern California in which it suf
fered consecutive losses for the
first time this season, No. 43 Stan
ford men's tennis (10-4,2-2 Pac-12)
returned home on Tuesday and
kicked off the final homestand of
its season with a bounce-back 4-2
victory over Cal Poly (7-12).
On a beautiful day at Taube
Family Tennis Stadium, the Cardi
nal took care of the doubles point
in short order with an 8-1 victory
on court one from their top doubles
pair of senior Daniel Ho and junior
Robert Stineman and a solid 8-3
win on court three from sophomore
Nolan Paige and freshman Yale
Goldberg.
Although junior John Morris
sey and senior Jamin Ball ran into
a more significant challenge as
they faced Cal Poly's second-seed
ed doubles pairing on court two,
the other two Stanford pairs quick
ly dispatching their competition
meant that the final doubles match
did not need to proceed to comple
tion and was abandoned with the
score tied at 6-6.

The Mustangs put up a more
substantial fight in the singles
matches, as sophomore Anthony
Tsodikov was the only Cardinal
player able to emerge with a quick
first-set victory with his 6-3 score.
Meanwhile, Morrissey, sophomore
Trey Strobel and Paige were all
forced into tight first-set tiebreaks
on courts one, three and four, re
spectively. Unfortunately for the
Cardinal, all three went point-for
point with their opponents but
eventually cracked at the tail ends
of hard-fought sets as Cal Poly
players took all three tiebreaks for
a trio of 7-6 first-set wins.

Meanwhile, on court five,
Tsodikov finished up a straight-set
victory with a 7-5 second-set mark
over Cal Poly senior Matt Thom
son to conclude the first singles
match of the afternoon as Morris
sey was just getting underway
with his second set. It was a great
opportunity to bounce back for
Tsodikov, who lost a 6-1, 6-1 deci
sion to UCLA's Karue Sell over the
weekend in his last outing.
Ho was next to finish, dropping
a 6-3, 6-2 decision to Mustang
freshman Ben Donovan to yield
the first Cal Poly point of the after
noon. Stineman then finished up a
straight-set 7-5, 6-1 victory on
court six over junior Naveen
Beasley to put Stanford up 3-1 and

require just one more Cardinal
point for the victory.
Although Strobel fell behind in
an early 5-2 hole in the second set,
he battled all the way back to tie it
up at 6-6 before falling in another
tiebreaker to yield a second team
point to Cal Poly, making it 3-2
Stanford with Morrissey and Paige
still playing their third sets.
Meanwhile, Morrissey didn't
seem at all fazed by the tough first
set tiebreak and seemed to use it
as added motivation as he dominat
ed senior Marco Comuzzo in a 6-0
second set win on court one. He
never looked back, going on to
claim a 6-4 victory in the third set
to take the match and seal the win

for the Cardinal with the fourth
and deciding team point. With the
win, Paige's match was cut short
with the sophomore trailing 4-2 in
the third set.
The Cardinal will look to con
tinue its winning ways as they will
next welcome a pair of conference
opponents over the weekend, with
Washington visiting the Farm on
Friday before a tougher matchup
against No. 39 Oregon on Satur
day. The matchups seem to bode
well for the Cardinal, which have
not lost a match to a team ranked
outside the top 10 all season.
