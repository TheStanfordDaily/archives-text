# Taking a new perspective into Spring Game
## 
### Vignesh Venkataraman 
Spring is truly an amazing
time of year. The weather
gets warmer, the hills of
northern California get
coated in lush green grass,
people start their annual intake of al
lergy medications and class atten
dance drops as a function of both the
weather and any rush-related events
held the night before. However, all of
these things pale in comparison to the
biggest news that spring always ush
ers in with it: Football is back.
The diehards among us football
fans cringe when the Super Bowl win
ner is crowned at the first weekend in
February, for this means that there
will be little to no real football on tele
vision for a few months. Admittedly,
there is the newfangled notion of the
NFL Network, which promises foot
ball eveiy hour* of every day, and there
is the drama and pageantry of the
NFL Draft and associated rolls of
body fat pertaining to the Spandex
Olympics also known as the Scout
ing Combine. However, I personally
don't consider either of those as viable
football alternatives, mainly because
Comcast wants me to pay them an ad
ditional 20 bucks a month just for one
channel that only I will watch, and the
NFL Draft and Combine only make
me miss actual football even more.

Rant aside, at long last, the day
has almost arrived; this Saturday my
cravings will be satisfied and I will be
able to quench my now-unbearable
thirst for football as the annual Stan
ford Spring Game (more accurately a
scrimmage) will be played at 1 p.m.
Watching this game (and with some
luck, all other home games), however,
will be a veiy different experience for
me, as I will be providing color com
mentary for KZSU from the press box.
My normal game-watching rou
tine involves a series of bad habits, in
cluding (but not limited to) extensive
consumption of junk food, swearing at
the TV screen in hopes that there is
some level of transference of my dis
approval to the players on the screen,
swearing at the TV screen in hopes
that the coach is paying attention,
swearing at the TV screen in hopes
that God will take pity on me and in
tervene and occasionally explaining to
my mother and brother what is actu
ally going on in the game. The last
part of the routine is highly uncom
mon and often ignored, mainly be
cause my mother and brother both
hate football and more often than not,
I've already been summarily booted
from the living room due to my potty
mouth.
It will come as a shock to no one
that none of these tactics will be valid
or even allowed when I'm in the press
box this Saturday. For one, there are
strict rales of etiquette in the press
box that prevent loud and obnoxious
consumption of food (dam it!) and
yelling and screaming or any shows of
partisan bias (darn it all!). Probably
more relevant is the fact that swear
ing on air is a one-way ticket to
Finesville (darn it again!) and most
definitely grounds for immediate dis
missal.
The good news is that instead of my
mother and brother ignoring my in
depth football analysis, I will have a
dedicated and passionate audience that
wants to really know and understand
what is going 0n... I hope. If not, the
perks of chilling in the press box and
avoiding the nasty lines to get into the
stadium are reward enough for me.
The upcoming football season
holds immense promise for the Stan
ford Cardinal, but also a lot of un
knowns. Fresh off yet another trip to a
BCS bowl, there are longtime starters
to replace, new players to get excited
about and a whole conference of
strong teams and rivals that have a
vested interest in dethroning Stan
ford from its spot atop the Pac-12.
Put succinctly, football is back,
ladies and gentlemen. I'm just hon
ored and privileged to be along for the
ride.

him for a shout-oat at viggy@stan

cause my mother and brother both
hate football and more often than not,
I've already been summarily booted
from the living room due to my potty
mouth.
It will come as a shock to no one
that none of these tactics will be valid
or even allowed when I'm in the press
box this Saturday. For one, there are
strict rales of etiquette in the press
box that prevent loud and obnoxious
consumption of food (dam it!) and
yelling and screaming or any shows of
partisan bias (darn it all!). Probably
more relevant is the fact that swear
ing on air is a one-way ticket to
Finesville (darn it again!) and most
definitely grounds for immediate dis
missal.
The good news is that instead of my
mother and brother ignoring my in
depth football analysis, I will have a
dedicated and passionate audience that
wants to really know and understand
what is going 0n... I hope. If not, the
perks of chilling in the press box and
avoiding the nasty lines to get into the
stadium are reward enough for me.
The upcoming football season
holds immense promise for the Stan
ford Cardinal, but also a lot of un
knowns. Fresh off yet another trip to a
BCS bowl, there are longtime starters
to replace, new players to get excited
about and a whole conference of
strong teams and rivals that have a
vested interest in dethroning Stan
ford from its spot atop the Pac-12.
Put succinctly, football is back,
ladies and gentlemen. I'm just hon
ored and privileged to be along for the
ride.

Vignesh Venkataraman would real
ly, really appreciate it if you listened
to KZSU's call of the Cardinal's
Spring Game this Saturday. Ask
him for a shout-oat at viggy@stan
ford. edu or follow him for some witty
banter @viggyfresh on Twitter.

Watching this game
will be a very
different experience.
