FIRST INITIATIVE, IF ELECTED: Implementa
tion of the All-Campus Day of Action, which
Miller framed as "rallying points to create
lasting times of service."
Lauren Miller 'l5 and Geo Saba 'l5 have
centered their campaign on "Breaking Bub

bles," or expanding the student body's
awareness beyond the campus community.
Miller divided this broader theme into
three actionable objectives: serving student
groups, engaging the community and pro
moting mental health and wellness.
Among other initiatives, Miller and Saba
plan to implement a campus-wide day of
service if they are elected. They also hope to
boost the credibility of the ASSU in the eyes
of the student body by sponsoring more out
reach.
"I've been thinking about it since the end
of my sophomore year when [my] Senate
[term] ended because I knew my time with
the ASSU wasn't done, and I knew I wanted
to do more," Miller said.
Both political science majors, she and Sa
ba became close friends while working to
gether in the White House this fall as part of
the Stanford in Washington (SIW) program.
As a sophomore, Miller served on the AS
SU Undergraduate Senate as the Chair of
the Administration and Rules Committee,
having participated in the ASSU's Leader
ship Development Program and having act
ed as Communications Director of the
Freshman Council the previous year.
Saba, the current chair of the ASSU Con
stitutional Council, has argued that their ex
perience in the ASSU better qualifies them
for a position on the executive team. In addi
tion to their ASSU leadership, Miller and
Saba are both involved in the Pre-Law Soci
ety and Greek life, and Saba is on the varsi
ty baseball team.
"Having the opportunity my senior year
[to serve] as executive ... is the highest hon
or I could have," Miller said.
Both Miller and Saba emphasized their
goal of making action items "realistic and
measurable." As part of their platform,

Miller and Saba want to
reestablish "de-stress your
self" week and initiate sev
eral all-campus days of serv
ice.
Miller emphasized their
support for the SAFE Re
form proposal a constitu
tional amendment on this
year's ballot that aims to re
form student activities fund
ing and said that, if elect
ed, they would focus on sup
porting student groups as
they transitioned into the
new policies.
They also plan on pro
moting awareness of the
ASSU in the student body
by engaging freshman in the
ASSU during NSO and in
volving students "from
every crack and crevice" of
the campus community on
their executive cabinet.
Miller and Saba have
been endorsed by Stanford
Democrats, The Stanford
Review, the Jewish Students
Association, Fossil Free
Stanford, Happiness Collec
tive, Stanford Women in
Medicine and the Women's
Coalition.
