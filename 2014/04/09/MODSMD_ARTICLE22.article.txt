# Rowers take strides over weekend
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
All three Stanford rowing teams
competed last weekend, making big
strides in their respective regattas
to gain momentum heading into the
main part of the season.
Lightweight women's, in its first
regatta of the season against other
lightweight teams specifically, fol
lowed up its 2013 IRA National
Championship with a first place fin
ish in the Collegiate Lightweight
Grand Final at the San Diego Crew
Classic. The varsity eight outpaced
its greatest competition in the Clas
sic, Princeton, by a margin of just
over five seconds to finish the week
end undefeated. The win extended
the varsity eight boat's winning
streak in the Classic to four consec
utive years.
"[Princeton] is throughout the
season our [greatest] competitor,
and so we go in hoping that we'll
come out on top but I wouldn't say
it's a given; they are a very compet
itive team and we go into it with a
fighting spirit," said junior Macken
zie Crist.
On Saturday, in the first heat, the
Cardinal routed Princeton, winning
by a huge margin of nine seconds.
Typically a big win is considered to
be of a margin at which point the
boats don't overlap and there's open
water for a men's race that's
three seconds and for women's is
four to five so Stanford had a con
siderable victory over Princeton in
both heats. Since the pool of boats is
so small (five boats), all boats ad
vance to the final heat; the teams
were competing for lane-placement.
The Crew Classic took place at
Mission Bay in San Diego, where the
course has its lane disadvantages
due to the current and the crosswind
from the ocean, with lane one being
more protected. The Cardinal se
cured lane one by winning the first
heat and put itself in a good position
to win the final heat.
This weekend also served as a
measure for how the team will fare
against Harvard in races to come,
since Harvard reigns among the
greatest competitors in lightweight.
Harvard did not compete in the
Classic, but Stanford will go up
against the Crimson in two weeks in
Boston.
"During the final event, though
we knew we were a faster crew than
Princeton, we wanted to make sure
that we could beat them as much as

we possibly could," said sophomore
Brittany Presten. "Based on last
year, our biggest competition is
Harvard, so it was important to set
a tone and get practice being as ag
gressive as we can for when we
meet a crew that is faster and better
than us."

No. 8 men's rowing also competed
in the San Diego Crew Classic, with
the varsity eight advancing to the fi
nals of the Men's Collegiate Invita
tional, which features the best colle
giate eights in the field, after edging
No. 10 Northeastern in the prelims
by 2.7 seconds.
Since it was the same location
that the lightweights had to face, the
prelims were also especially impor
tant in terms of lane placement. In
stead of having the top seeds placed
in the middle lanes, the winner of the
heat was placed in the more-advanta
geous lane one.
"We've been thinking a lot about
starting and getting out really fast so
we executed and did what we wanted
to d 0... which was winning the heat,"
said senior Austin Hack.
The Card wasn't able to muster
the same dominant performance and
fell to No. 2 Cal by a margin of just

under six seconds and Northeastern
on Sunday in the final heat to finish in
third. The Cardinal, however, have
yet to settle on a fixed varsity eight
boat. With the lineup changing with
each practice and with four freshmen
competing in the varsity eight boat
on Sunday, Stanford has a lot of room
for improvement.
In the final heat on Sunday, the
Cardinal started off slow, allowing
Cal to take the early lead and eventu
ally allowing Northeastern to over
take them.
"We knew that Cal was the
fastest off the starting line and so we
were trying to get out with them,"
Hack said. "We were already having
a shaky race, so as [Cal] moved
away we were just thinking about
that boat and then they were gone
and Northeastern started coming
up on us a bit and they gradually
overtook us."
Despite an undesirable finish in
the final heat, the Card still gained a
moral victory in beating a highly re
spected Northeastern team by a
good margin in the prelims, provid
ing confidence for the team and set
ting the groundwork for this week
end's races against Washington,
Washington State and Oregon State.

"We're hoping that we can im
prove from this race and find out
what combinations work best for our
varsity boat and move people around
so we can keep working towards our
fastest line-up," Hack said. "It
wouldn't be out of the question to be
making switches the week before the
national championship."

Finally, No. 11 women's rowing
had a great display at the Oregon
State Classic, its second regatta of
the season, with the 2VB (second var
sity eight boat) halting No. 2 Ohio
State's 19-race winning streak, hold
ing off the Buckeyes' early surge to
come out on top.
"We went out and stalled ahead
and then [Ohio State] took a really
great move and ended up walking
through [overtaking] us and winning
the race. So Ohio State upped the
pressure, passed us and ended up
winning the race by one-point-four
seconds," said sophomore Emily
Grundman. "For us, that served as
motivation for in the afternoon,
which we ended up winning. The sec
ond [race] was really close as well.
Ohio State lost by 1.2 seconds so the
margins were pretty similar, but it
was flipped this time in our favor and

everything worked out in a really
great way."

It's especially important for the
2VB to do well in addition to the var
sity eight boat, as the whole team has
to collectively have enough success to
qualify for NCAAs, so the depth of
the team early on (including the var
sity four boat) holds great impor
tance in its qualification at the end of
the season. Each of Stanford's IVB,
2VB and varsity four boats finished in
the top three in the morning and af
ternoon sessions of the Classic.
"Ohio State won NCAAs last
year, which is great to have such a
tough schedule because it motivates
you to compete to the best of your ca
pabilities, and the IYB boat only got
edged out by Ohio State by one sec
ond, so the margin was really close,"
Grundman said. "That really bodes
well for us for the future because this
was only our second regatta of the
season. So knowing that this is
where we are currently and that this
is something where we can put in
more work and develop as the sea
son continues, is just so intensely
gratifying."

Harvard, so it was important to set
a tone and get practice being as ag
gressive as we can for when we
meet a crew that is faster and better
than us."

No. 8 men's rowing also competed
in the San Diego Crew Classic, with
the varsity eight advancing to the fi
nals of the Men's Collegiate Invita
tional, which features the best colle
giate eights in the field, after edging
No. 10 Northeastern in the prelims
by 2.7 seconds.
Since it was the same location
that the lightweights had to face, the
prelims were also especially impor
tant in terms of lane placement. In
stead of having the top seeds placed
in the middle lanes, the winner of the
heat was placed in the more-advanta
geous lane one.
"We've been thinking a lot about
starting and getting out really fast so
we executed and did what we wanted
to d 0... which was winning the heat,"
said senior Austin Hack.
The Card wasn't able to muster
the same dominant performance and
fell to No. 2 Cal by a margin of just

under six seconds and Northeastern
on Sunday in the final heat to finish in
third. The Cardinal, however, have
yet to settle on a fixed varsity eight
boat. With the lineup changing with
each practice and with four freshmen
competing in the varsity eight boat
on Sunday, Stanford has a lot of room
for improvement.
In the final heat on Sunday, the
Cardinal started off slow, allowing
Cal to take the early lead and eventu
ally allowing Northeastern to over
take them.
"We knew that Cal was the
fastest off the starting line and so we
were trying to get out with them,"
Hack said. "We were already having
a shaky race, so as [Cal] moved
away we were just thinking about
that boat and then they were gone
and Northeastern started coming
up on us a bit and they gradually
overtook us."
Despite an undesirable finish in
the final heat, the Card still gained a
moral victory in beating a highly re
spected Northeastern team by a
good margin in the prelims, provid
ing confidence for the team and set
ting the groundwork for this week
end's races against Washington,
Washington State and Oregon State.

"We're hoping that we can im
prove from this race and find out
what combinations work best for our
varsity boat and move people around
so we can keep working towards our
fastest line-up," Hack said. "It
wouldn't be out of the question to be
making switches the week before the
national championship."

Finally, No. 11 women's rowing
had a great display at the Oregon
State Classic, its second regatta of
the season, with the 2VB (second var
sity eight boat) halting No. 2 Ohio
State's 19-race winning streak, hold
ing off the Buckeyes' early surge to
come out on top.
"We went out and stalled ahead
and then [Ohio State] took a really
great move and ended up walking
through [overtaking] us and winning
the race. So Ohio State upped the
pressure, passed us and ended up
winning the race by one-point-four
seconds," said sophomore Emily
Grundman. "For us, that served as
motivation for in the afternoon,
which we ended up winning. The sec
ond [race] was really close as well.
Ohio State lost by 1.2 seconds so the
margins were pretty similar, but it
was flipped this time in our favor and

everything worked out in a really
great way."

It's especially important for the
2VB to do well in addition to the var
sity eight boat, as the whole team has
to collectively have enough success to
qualify for NCAAs, so the depth of
the team early on (including the var
sity four boat) holds great impor
tance in its qualification at the end of
the season. Each of Stanford's IVB,
2VB and varsity four boats finished in
the top three in the morning and af
ternoon sessions of the Classic.
"Ohio State won NCAAs last
year, which is great to have such a
tough schedule because it motivates
you to compete to the best of your ca
pabilities, and the IYB boat only got
edged out by Ohio State by one sec
ond, so the margin was really close,"
Grundman said. "That really bodes
well for us for the future because this
was only our second regatta of the
season. So knowing that this is
where we are currently and that this
is something where we can put in
more work and develop as the sea
son continues, is just so intensely
gratifying."

Senior Austin Hack (right) led the No. 8 Stanford men's rowing team to a berth in the finals of the Men's Collegiate Invitational at the San Diego
Crew Classic this past weekend. The team finished third in the final heat, but has room for improvement with combinations still to be sorted out.
All three Stanford rowing teams
competed last weekend, making big
strides in their respective regattas
to gain momentum heading into the
main part of the season.
Lightweight women's, in its first
regatta of the season against other
lightweight teams specifically, fol
lowed up its 2013 IRA National
Championship with a first place fin
ish in the Collegiate Lightweight
Grand Final at the San Diego Crew
Classic. The varsity eight outpaced
its greatest competition in the Clas
sic, Princeton, by a margin of just
over five seconds to finish the week
end undefeated. The win extended
the varsity eight boat's winning
streak in the Classic to four consec
utive years.
"[Princeton] is throughout the
season our [greatest] competitor,
and so we go in hoping that we'll
come out on top but I wouldn't say
it's a given; they are a very compet
itive team and we go into it with a
fighting spirit," said junior Macken
zie Crist.
On Saturday, in the first heat, the
Cardinal routed Princeton, winning
by a huge margin of nine seconds.
Typically a big win is considered to
be of a margin at which point the
boats don't overlap and there's open
water for a men's race that's
three seconds and for women's is
four to five so Stanford had a con
siderable victory over Princeton in
both heats. Since the pool of boats is
so small (five boats), all boats ad
vance to the final heat; the teams
were competing for lane-placement.
The Crew Classic took place at
Mission Bay in San Diego, where the
course has its lane disadvantages
due to the current and the crosswind
from the ocean, with lane one being
more protected. The Cardinal se
cured lane one by winning the first
heat and put itself in a good position
to win the final heat.
This weekend also served as a
measure for how the team will fare
against Harvard in races to come,
since Harvard reigns among the
greatest competitors in lightweight.
Harvard did not compete in the
Classic, but Stanford will go up
against the Crimson in two weeks in
Boston.
"During the final event, though
we knew we were a faster crew than
Princeton, we wanted to make sure
that we could beat them as much as

we possibly could," said sophomore
Brittany Presten. "Based on last
year, our biggest competition is
Harvard, so it was important to set
