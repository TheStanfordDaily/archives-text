FIRST INITIATIVE, IF ELECTED: Adding mental
health contacts to the emergency tab of the
iStanford app and increasing appointment
offerings in CAPS
Elizabeth Woodson 'l5 and Logan
Richard 'l5 have focused their campaign on
"Impact," which they say means something
different to every student at Stanford. They

plan to achieve this larger objective by "fix
ing what is broken" and "connecting what al
ready exists" within the ASSU.

Woodson said that she has wanted to run
for ASSU President since working for Jonny
Dorsey 'O9, who was elected to the ASSU
Executive in 2008. After hearing about
Dorsey's work as executive, including his ini
tiation of Earth Day, Woodson began think
ing about running for the ASSU executive as
away to promote service and social impact
on campus.
Good friends since their freshman year in
Junipero, Woodson asked Richard to be her
running mate last spring, and together the
duo has been preparing their candidacy
since.
Woodson and Richard said the mental
health initiatives in their platform were their
first priority.
Woodson explained that, if elected, their
first action item as executives would be
adding mental health contacts to the emer
gency tab of the iStanford app. She also said
they would immediately start the process of
increasing the availability of CAPS appoint
ments by working with administrators to up
the number and convenience of the appoint
ments and involving graduate students from
the medical school.
"It's a cultural shift that needs to happen
too," Woodson said, "We are really interest
ed in changing [services] from reactive to
proactive."
The slate also mentioned pre-major ad
vising and a campus-wide event calendar as
areas where they planned to focus their en
ergy as executives based on feedback
they've received from their peers.
While they have different opinions on
SAFE reform, Woodson and Richard said
that they would support the bill if it passed

by initiating transition
processes and would contin
ue the conversation around
student funding reform if it
did not.
"The ASSU is a $1.5 mil
lion non-profit, and I've done
nothing but work for non
profits my whole life," Wood

son concluded. "In terms of
governmental functioning,
we haven't seen proof of
translation between experi
ence in the ASSU and get
ting stuff done."
Woodson and Richard
have been endorsed by the
First-Generation Low-In
come Partnership (FLIP),
Fossil Free Stanford and the
Happiness Collective.
