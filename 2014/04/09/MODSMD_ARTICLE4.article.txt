# STUDENT GOVERNMENT
## SAFE Reform prompts enthusiasm, controversy 
### ANDREW VOGELEY DESK EDITOR 
The item on this year's spring
ballot with the potential for the
greatest and most enduring impact
on students isn't a contest between
slates or individual candidates. In
stead, a constitutional amendment
under consideration aims to almost
completely overhaul the current stu
dent activities funding system
and has prompted controversy ac
cordingly.
The Student Activities Fee
(SAFE) Reform proposal reflects
efforts by this year's ASSU officers
to rein in out-of-control increases in
student activity fees, in a project
that first began last spring. If the
measure is voted on by at least 15
percent of the undergraduate stu

dent population and two-thirds of
that population votes in favor, the
new system will go into effect for the
2015-16 academic year.
"Nobody told us, 'do this project.'
It developed really naturally from us
going to Senate meetings and seeing
problems we wanted to fix," said
Justine Moore 'l6, who co-authored
the bill with her sister Olivia Moore
'l6.
Justine and Olivia researched
the funding process throughout the
spring and began to work with AS
SU Executive Cabinet members Vi
raj Bindra 'l5, Najla Gomez 'l4 and
Hunter Kodama 'l4 over the sum
mer.
"One of the things we did a lot
during the spring was look into how
other schools did funding,"
Justine said. "And they all
had way lower fees. We didn't
think there was a reason for
us to be paying more than
students at other schools
did."
Although Stanford's quar
terly student activity fee has
increased by $lOO practi
cally doubling over the
past 15 years, previous at
tempts at financial reform
have floundered. ASSU Ex
ecutives Dan Ashton 'l4 and
Billy Gallagher 'l4 made fi
nancial reform a major point
of emphasis for their term af
ter an initial attempt to pass
financial reform on last
year's ballot did not succeed.
"[The biggest difference]
is that Justine and Olivia
have spent a lot more time
working on the reform," said
Stephen Trusheim 'l3 M.S.
'l4, assistant ASSU financial
manager, who also framed
this year's effort as more da
ta-driven than previous at
tempts.
The new grants
If passed, SAFE Reform
will effectively dismantle the
current system and replace it
with one intended to lower
the student activity fee and
make the funding system
more efficient.
The proposed system ulti
mately makes three major
changes: the elimination of
the distinction between spe
cial fees and general fees
groups, the introduction of a
Funding Board to oversee
and recommend budgets, and
the freezing of the reserves
of special fees groups.
Instead of special fees and
general fees groups, there
will be three types of
"grants" for which any group
can apply: major, minor and
quick.
Major grants are for
groups applying for more
than $B,OOO per year, and to
some extent, are most similar
to special fees in that they
will be voted on by the stu
dent body in the spring elec
tions. Minor grants, on the
other hand, are more analo

gous to general fees. They
will be awarded once a
month, with a soft cap of
about $B,OOO per group per
year.
"A good thing about minor
grants is that bigger groups
don't have to budget as far in
advance," Olivia said.
Currently, groups that re
ceive special fees are not eli
gible to receive general fees
funding, limiting then' flexi
bility.
"Groups have to plan
more than a year and a half in
advance to get their funds [as
of right now]," Trusheim said.
The introduction of quick
grants, the aspect of the re
form perhaps most crucial
for decreasing the student
fee, has no real comparison in
the current system.
Quick grants would be
evaluated on a weekly basis
and have no cap on the
amount that can be awarded.
"If you have a cool last
minute opportunity to bring a
speaker to campus, you can
apply for a quick grant,"
Olivia said.
The real purpose of quick
grants, however, is to act as a
reserve for all student
groups. The current system
allows each special fees group
to have a reserve and each
general fees group to draw
from the general fees re
serve. The size of groups' in
dividual reserves which
currently average over
$61,000 is a principal driv
er of the increase in student
activities fees. According to
ASSU data, only 70 to 80 per
cent of the total money col
lected by the student fee is
being spent by student
groups each year
The second component of
SAFE Reform calls for the
freezing of most groups' re
serves, with the idea that
groups can use quick grants
to fulfill last minute needs.
The reform initially called
for the elimination of re
serves completely, but that
proposal faced pushback
from many groups across
campus.
"One of the biggest [prob
lems] [initially] was re
serves," Bindra said. "Talk
ing to student groups, we re
alized [cutting reserves] was
a major concern because they
felt like the money was their

own and students expressed
that they had chosen these
groups to receive the money."
Some groups, like Stan
ford Concert Network and
Stanford Speakers' Bureau,
will be able to apply for the
ability to replenish their re
serves.
"For Frost [Music Festi
val], we spend money based
[on the assumption] the con
cert sell[s] out and if it does
not sell out, we still have to
pay everything, which is why
we have our reserves, as like
a safety net," said Christophe
Auber 'l6, financial officer of
Stanford Concert Network.

The new Funding Board
The final major compo
nent of SAFE Reform deals
with the approval of budgets
and the distribution of money
Currently the Senate's Ap
propriations Committee re
views budget requests for
both special fees and general
fees groups. The seven-per
son Appropriations Commit
tee then recommends budg
ets to the entire Senate,
which typically approves
them. Special fee budgets are
then sent to the student body
in the spring election for ap
proval.
The Senate, though, has
dealt with issues of high or
complete turnover in recent
years, leading to a decrease
in institutional knowledge
particularly about how fund
ing works, which is the Sen
ate's foremost responsibility.
The SAFE Reform pro
posal initially called for an in
dependent Funding Board
(with no Senators) that would
review and recommend
budgets to the Senate. After
conversations with current
Senators, the makeup of the
seven-person FUnding Board
now includes four Senators
and three members of the
student body well-versed in
the ASSU funding system,
such as former financial offi
cers or ASSU peer advisors.
"The Rmding Board was
the biggest change [from the

initial proposal]," said Senate
Chair Ben Holston 'l5. "I
think a lot of what [the Sen
ate] should do should be cen
tered on funding. I still want
ed to have good Senate rep
resentation on the Funding
Board."
The non-Senate Funding
Board members will be nom
inated by the outgoing Fund
ing Board and approved by
the Senate.
Opposition to the measure
In the run-up to this
week's elections, a number of
students have expressed op
position to the SAFE Reform
proposal, charging that the
measure would restrict stu
dent group flexibility and re
sponsiveness to unexpected
events, subject the funding
process to the scrutiny of un
elected representatives and
generally constrain access to
funding.
"[The Funding Board]
concentrates so much power
in the hands of the few," said
Kevin Sunga 'l5, co-president
of the Asian American Stu
dents' Association. "A group
of people, whom I may or
may not know, have the pow
er to fund my group and cut
my budget â€”it makes me
feel somewhat uncomfort
able."
"Although it is a valiant at
tempt towards funding re
form, this bill is not the an
swer and is certainly unsafe,"
read an email signed by the
influential Students of Color
Coalition that was broadly
disseminated to University
mailing lists on Tuesday. "It's
impetuous and will threaten
the vibrant, diverse lives of
all students on campus."
This year's elections will
take place on April 10 and 11.
