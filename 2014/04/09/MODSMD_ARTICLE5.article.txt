# STUDENT GOVERNMENT
## GSC elections see limited candidate pool, turnout 
### EDWARD NGAI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Fourteen graduate students will
vie for positions on the Graduate
Student Council (GSC), the repre
sentative body for just over 60 per
cent of students at Stanford, in this
year's ASSU elections. Eight cur
rent Councilors, including GSC Co
chairs Bryce Anzelmo and Trevor
Martin, will seek re-election.
According to Martin, a third
year graduate student in biology,
the GSC impacts student life in
three main ways: programming,
like the annual grad formal; fund
ing, in a close parallel to the opera
tions of the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate; and advocacy, or represent
ing the diverse interests and experi
ences of over 11,000 graduate stu
dents.

Martin pointed to the website
launched by the GSC this year as an
example of how the body has tried
to become more relevant to the lives
of students. After Martin found that
many of his peers did not know what
the GSC was involved in, "one of
[the website's] main goals was to be
able to answer that question very
easily."
The reality, however, is that
graduate students are consistently
apathetic about the GSC and the
ASSU. Last year, less than 10 per
cent of graduate students voted in
the ASSU elections.
For the fourth time in five years,
the number of seats on the Council
will outnumber the number of can
didates running. Only two out of 14
candidates will "lose" their elec-


VICTOR XU/The Stanford Daily
tions, as the vast majority of
candidates will be returned
unopposed. And even then,
losing candidates will likely
be given the opportunity to
serve in the GSC anyway.
The GSC reserves five
seats for at-large represen
tation, with the remaining 10
of the GSC's 15 seats are ap
portioned based on a studen
t's field of study.
This year, only two candi
dates have declared for the
at-large seats, so, barring a
write-in campaign, the AS
SU election will not success
fully fill the GSC. That being
said, the last three elections
have returned councilors
elected by a single write-in
vote.
The process of filling
empty seats is governed by
the ASSU Constitution and
the GSC bylaws, which re
quest that the GSC vote on
who will fill the seats. Ac
cording to Paul Harold, a
third-year law student and
the GSC parliamentarian,
any graduate student will be
able to apply because any va
cant seats would be in the at
large district.
Record number of students
seeking re-election
About half of this year's
GSC will return as Coun
cilors again next year, with
the vast majority running in
uncontested races. Councilor

Petr Johanes 'l2, a masters
student at the Graduate
School of Education who is
running uncontested for re
election, says that the lack of
competition simply repre
sents the tradeoffs inherent
in life as a graduate student.
"It could be because not a
lot of people know about the
GSC, it could be because re
search demands and other
demands are too great for
the GSC to be a part of some
one's life," he said.
He pointed to the diversi
ty of students who belong to
the University's graduate
ranks, ranging from coterms
still very much in "college" to
parents with families to feed
and children to raise.
"Graduate life is very dif
ferent from undergraduate
life," he said.
According to Martin, hav
ing so many current Coun
cilors coasting towards re
election with few new faces
campaigning against them
will be a mixed blessing for
the body next year.
"On one end, it's great be
cause the projects we're
working on require continu
ity. I think institutional mem
ory is a big problem with stu
dent government and the
GSC in particular," he said.
"But there is a downside.
There may be fewer fresh
ideas, it might be a sign that
we need to work on our out
reach a bit... or maybe peo
ple are happy with their rep
resentatives. It's hard to say."

tions, as the vast majority of
candidates will be returned
unopposed. And even then,
losing candidates will likely
be given the opportunity to
serve in the GSC anyway.
The GSC reserves five
seats for at-large represen
tation, with the remaining 10
of the GSC's 15 seats are ap
portioned based on a studen
t's field of study.
This year, only two candi
dates have declared for the
at-large seats, so, barring a
write-in campaign, the AS
SU election will not success
fully fill the GSC. That being
said, the last three elections
have returned councilors
elected by a single write-in
vote.
The process of filling
empty seats is governed by
the ASSU Constitution and
the GSC bylaws, which re
quest that the GSC vote on
who will fill the seats. Ac
cording to Paul Harold, a
third-year law student and
the GSC parliamentarian,
any graduate student will be
able to apply because any va
cant seats would be in the at
large district.
Record number of students
seeking re-election
About half of this year's
GSC will return as Coun
cilors again next year, with
the vast majority running in
uncontested races. Councilor

Petr Johanes 'l2, a masters
student at the Graduate
School of Education who is
running uncontested for re
election, says that the lack of
competition simply repre
sents the tradeoffs inherent
in life as a graduate student.
"It could be because not a
lot of people know about the
GSC, it could be because re
search demands and other
demands are too great for
the GSC to be a part of some
one's life," he said.
He pointed to the diversi
ty of students who belong to
the University's graduate
ranks, ranging from coterms
still very much in "college" to
parents with families to feed
and children to raise.
"Graduate life is very dif
ferent from undergraduate
life," he said.
According to Martin, hav
ing so many current Coun
cilors coasting towards re
election with few new faces
campaigning against them
will be a mixed blessing for
the body next year.
"On one end, it's great be
cause the projects we're
working on require continu
ity. I think institutional mem
ory is a big problem with stu
dent government and the
GSC in particular," he said.
"But there is a downside.
There may be fewer fresh
ideas, it might be a sign that
we need to work on our out
reach a bit... or maybe peo
ple are happy with their rep
resentatives. It's hard to say."
