# STUDENT GOVERNMENT
## GSC elections see limited candidate pool, turnout 
### EDWARD NGAI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Fourteen graduate students will
vie for positions on the Graduate
Student Council (GSC), the repre
sentative body for just over 60 per
cent of students at Stanford, in this
year's ASSU elections. Eight cur
rent Councilors, including GSC Co
chairs Bryce Anzelmo and Trevor
Martin, will seek re-election.
According to Martin, a third
year graduate student in biology,
the GSC impacts student life in
three main ways: programming,
like the annual grad formal; fund
ing, in a close parallel to the opera
tions of the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate; and advocacy, or represent
ing the diverse interests and experi
ences of over 11,000 graduate stu
dents.

Martin pointed to the website
launched by the GSC this year as an
example of how the body has tried
to become more relevant to the lives
of students. After Martin found that
many of his peers did not know what
the GSC was involved in, "one of
[the website's] main goals was to be
able to answer that question very
easily."
The reality, however, is that
graduate students are consistently
apathetic about the GSC and the
ASSU. Last year, less than 10 per
cent of graduate students voted in
the ASSU elections.
For the fourth time in five years,
the number of seats on the Council
will outnumber the number of can
didates running. Only two out of 14
candidates will "lose" their elec-
