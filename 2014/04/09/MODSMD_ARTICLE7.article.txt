## EDITORIAL BOARD Vote Miller/Saba for ASSU Executive 
### 
For the 2014-15 ASSU Execu
tive, The Stanford Daily's Ed
itorial Board unanimously en
dorses Lauren Miller 'l5 and Geo
Saba 'l5, the slate that we feel will
best serve the student body over the
upcoming year through a combina
tion of focused and measurable poli
cies and a firm grasp on the nuances
and appropriate role of the ASSU.
Throughout the interview
process and Monday's Executive
slate debate, the Board found both
of this year's credible slates to pos
sess remarkable qualities. Both
Miller/Saba and Woodson/Richard
demonstrated clear leadership abili
ty, a passion for serving the student
body in its entirety and platforms
that combine ambition and attention
to detail. Given the ASSU's recent
struggles in attracting a credible set
of candidates at all levels of the bal
lot, both slates represent the oppor
tunity for the rejuvenation of Stan
ford's student government and,
through their shared support for
initiatives like increasing the AS
SU's engagement with freshmen,
we have high expectations for both
slates' ability to leave a construc
tive legacy. Nevertheless, given
that institutional decay and the lim
itations of time and scope imposed
on any ASSU Executive, we feel
most confident in Miller/Saba's abil
ity to make the most of their term in
office.
In recent years, the ASSU has
worked best when it has sought to
improve on existing processes and
resources, or to better support Stan
ford's abundance of thriving student
organizations. Conversely, it has his
torically struggled when seeking to
assume too much responsibility or
to function as a centralized body for
a student population that is both de
centralized and largely apathetic to
wards the ASSU.
Miller and Saba a former Sen
ator and the current Chair of the
Constitutional Council, respectively
have a unique familiarity with the
ASSU and how best to operate with
in the institution's framework, al
lowing them to seek to impact cam
pus life from the very start of their
term and effectively respond to un
foreseen and contentious issues as
they emerge.
Equally importantly, Miller/Saba
demonstrated a greater degree of
realism with regards to the ASSU's
limitations, the importance of prior
itizing between various legislative
initiatives and the value of empha
sizing initiatives like increasing
the availability of meeting and prac
tice spaces that can be accom
plished within a year, rather than
dashing between divergent efforts,
imposing on the work of student
groups and administrators with
more experience in a given field and
ultimately becoming overwhelmed
by an overly ambitious workload.
This familiarity with how best to
serve the student body from within
the ASSU will benefit the Miller/Sa
ba slate most clearly with regards to
the implementation of the SAFE
Reform proposal, should it win ap
proval from the student body at the
end of this week. A comprehensive
overhaul of Stanford's student activ
ities funding system is a necessary
and critical measure, and one that
both slates have professed support
for. Given, however, the importance
of a smooth transition, we retain
more confidence in the more experi
enced slate's ability to effectively
manage the changeover.
A successful Executive should al
so be able to effectively represent

the student body in its entirety, in
cluding possessing the ability to
forge connections with segments of
the student body that have been his
torically neglected. Miller has
demonstrated the ability to build re
lationships with divergent groups
across campus, a trait that will
prove valuable over the upcoming
year. Saba's status as a student-ath
lete, meanwhile, represents an op
portunity to not only engage with a
significant and often distant part of
the Stanford community but also to
draw on the lessons and resources
that the student-athlete community
has successfully made use of.
We commend Woodson and
Richard for their planned engage
ment with the student-athlete com
munity, and we are enthusiastic
about their idea of implementing the
Athletic Department's popular men
torship program across the broader
student body, but we view the
Miller/Saba slate as better posi
tioned to implement it.

Woodson and Richard's
strengths as a slate and as candi
dates remain significant. The slate
demonstrated a remarkable enthu
siasm for establishing relationships
with students, faculty and adminis
trators that would stand any ASSU
Executive in good stead. They
moreover produced a platform that
stood apart in its comprehensive na
ture and attention to detail, and we
encourage Miller and Saba to adopt
measures like an emphasis on im
proved advising.
We remain concerned, however,
that the slate appears to have adopt
ed somewhat of a scattershot ap
proach to its legislative priorities,
some of which seem unattainable
within just a year, and feel that it
would benefit from the focus and at
tention to feasibility —if not the
slightly more cursory approach to
details demonstrated by the
Miller/Saba slate.
This endorsement is an affirma
tive one. The Stanford community
would ultimately be well served by
either slate, and we encourage the
successful slate to draw on the bet
ter ideas of its rival. Nevertheless,
the Miller/Saba slate offers a combi
nation of more experienced leader
ship, the intent of combining realis
tic and pragmatic short- and long
term measures into a comprehen
sive and successful legacy and the
ability to broaden the appeal of the
ASSU to an alarmingly apathetic
community. For those reasons, this
Board extends our full support to
the Miller/Saba slate in this year's
ASSU election.

most confident in Miller/Saba's abil
ity to make the most of their term in
office.
In recent years, the ASSU has
worked best when it has sought to
improve on existing processes and
resources, or to better support Stan
ford's abundance of thriving student
organizations. Conversely, it has his
torically struggled when seeking to
assume too much responsibility or
to function as a centralized body for
a student population that is both de
centralized and largely apathetic to
wards the ASSU.
Miller and Saba a former Sen
ator and the current Chair of the
Constitutional Council, respectively
have a unique familiarity with the
ASSU and how best to operate with
in the institution's framework, al
lowing them to seek to impact cam
pus life from the very start of their
term and effectively respond to un
foreseen and contentious issues as
they emerge.
Equally importantly, Miller/Saba
demonstrated a greater degree of
realism with regards to the ASSU's
limitations, the importance of prior
itizing between various legislative
initiatives and the value of empha
sizing initiatives like increasing
the availability of meeting and prac
tice spaces that can be accom
plished within a year, rather than
dashing between divergent efforts,
imposing on the work of student
groups and administrators with
more experience in a given field and
ultimately becoming overwhelmed
by an overly ambitious workload.
This familiarity with how best to
serve the student body from within
the ASSU will benefit the Miller/Sa
ba slate most clearly with regards to
the implementation of the SAFE
Reform proposal, should it win ap
proval from the student body at the
end of this week. A comprehensive
overhaul of Stanford's student activ
ities funding system is a necessary
and critical measure, and one that
both slates have professed support
for. Given, however, the importance
of a smooth transition, we retain
more confidence in the more experi
enced slate's ability to effectively
manage the changeover.
A successful Executive should al
so be able to effectively represent

the student body in its entirety, in
cluding possessing the ability to
forge connections with segments of
the student body that have been his
torically neglected. Miller has
demonstrated the ability to build re
lationships with divergent groups
across campus, a trait that will
prove valuable over the upcoming
year. Saba's status as a student-ath
lete, meanwhile, represents an op
portunity to not only engage with a
significant and often distant part of
the Stanford community but also to
draw on the lessons and resources
that the student-athlete community
has successfully made use of.
We commend Woodson and
Richard for their planned engage
ment with the student-athlete com
munity, and we are enthusiastic
about their idea of implementing the
Athletic Department's popular men
torship program across the broader
student body, but we view the
Miller/Saba slate as better posi
tioned to implement it.

Woodson and Richard's
strengths as a slate and as candi
dates remain significant. The slate
demonstrated a remarkable enthu
siasm for establishing relationships
with students, faculty and adminis
trators that would stand any ASSU
Executive in good stead. They
moreover produced a platform that
stood apart in its comprehensive na
ture and attention to detail, and we
encourage Miller and Saba to adopt
measures like an emphasis on im
proved advising.
We remain concerned, however,
that the slate appears to have adopt
ed somewhat of a scattershot ap
proach to its legislative priorities,
some of which seem unattainable
within just a year, and feel that it
would benefit from the focus and at
tention to feasibility —if not the
slightly more cursory approach to
details demonstrated by the
Miller/Saba slate.
This endorsement is an affirma
tive one. The Stanford community
would ultimately be well served by
either slate, and we encourage the
successful slate to draw on the bet
ter ideas of its rival. Nevertheless,
the Miller/Saba slate offers a combi
nation of more experienced leader
ship, the intent of combining realis
tic and pragmatic short- and long
term measures into a comprehen
sive and successful legacy and the
ability to broaden the appeal of the
ASSU to an alarmingly apathetic
community. For those reasons, this
Board extends our full support to
the Miller/Saba slate in this year's
ASSU election.

Miller and Saba have a
unique familiarity with
the ASSU and how best
to operate within it.
For the 2014-15 ASSU Execu
tive, The Stanford Daily's Ed
itorial Board unanimously en
dorses Lauren Miller 'l5 and Geo
Saba 'l5, the slate that we feel will
best serve the student body over the
upcoming year through a combina
tion of focused and measurable poli
cies and a firm grasp on the nuances
and appropriate role of the ASSU.
Throughout the interview
process and Monday's Executive
slate debate, the Board found both
of this year's credible slates to pos
sess remarkable qualities. Both
Miller/Saba and Woodson/Richard
demonstrated clear leadership abili
ty, a passion for serving the student
body in its entirety and platforms
that combine ambition and attention
to detail. Given the ASSU's recent
struggles in attracting a credible set
of candidates at all levels of the bal
lot, both slates represent the oppor
tunity for the rejuvenation of Stan
ford's student government and,
through their shared support for
initiatives like increasing the AS
SU's engagement with freshmen,
we have high expectations for both
slates' ability to leave a construc
tive legacy. Nevertheless, given
that institutional decay and the lim
itations of time and scope imposed
on any ASSU Executive, we feel
