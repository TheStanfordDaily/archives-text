# ASSU Exec: vote yes on SAFE Reform
## 
### Dan Ashton Billy Gallagher 
As soon as we were elected last year, we assem
bled a team to focus on one important question:
How can we make ASSU funding better? We've
met with hundreds of students and found a major, over
riding truth: ASSU funding doesn't work.
Why? ASSU funding is unclear. It's hard to access.
Except for about 50 big groups with practically unlim
ited budgets, it doesn't give any group more than
$7,000 hardly enough for a growing group. The fee
is too high; in fact, it's the highest student fee at any
university, and last spring 14 percent of students chose
not to pay it, taking money away from the groups that
need it most. Worst of all, we found incredible waste in
the system millions of dollars sit in "reserve" ac
counts for years. In fact, only about 75 percent of the
money you pay is ever spent for anyone's benefit.
We've proposed SAFE Reform as a solution to all of
these issues. Here are the raw facts: SAFE Reform
cuts the student fee by 20 percent while increasing the
amount of money available to student groups by more
than 10 percent. It makes funding more flexible for
every group, with a common "reserve." It keeps the
exact same ASSU control over funding the Senate is
still in charge of most allocations, and the student body
still votes on all major allocations.

Some people don't understand what SAFE Reform
does and are afraid of changing a system even when
the change we propose is the result of a year of re
search and collaboration with hundreds of student
leaders. A previous editorial lays out why SAFE Re
form isn't just a step forward, it's a leap forward. You
can visit the SAFE website (assu.stanford.edu/safe-re
form) for more information, including direct responses
to recent criticisms. In short, SAFE Reform criticisms
are filled with misinformation.
No one wants to see an ASSU that wastes 25 per
cent of the money it charges students. No one wants to
see an astronomical student fee, especially when we
can support more student groups with a smaller bur
den on students. Unfortunately, all of that is true today,
and it won't get better. SAFE Reform fixes today's
problems and lets the ASSU keep improving the fund
ing system to better serve everyone.
Tomorrow, vote "yes" on SAFE Reform. It's better
for students, and better for Stanford's 850 student
groups. Together, we can fix a broken ASSU.
