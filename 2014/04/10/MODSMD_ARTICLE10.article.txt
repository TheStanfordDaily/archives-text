## Stanford's sixth title on the line First title in three years within sight for the Card 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
The No. 4 Stanford men's gymnastics team
(8-4) will begin competition at the NCAA Cham
pionships in Ann Arbor, Mich, today as it seeks
to bring home the sixth national title in program
history and its first since 2011.
After a second-place finish at the MPSF
Championships behind only No. 1 Oklahoma on
March 29, the Cardinal will be looking to finish
in the top three of the first session in order to
advance to Friday's team finals. Standing in the
Cardinal's way of doing that, however, is a tough
field consisting of Oklahoma, No. 5 Illinois, No.
8 lowa, No. 9 California and No. 12 William and
Mary.
The last time Stanford faced both Illinois
and lowa was in last year's NCAA Champi
onships, when the Cardinal finished third,
ahead of both the Illini and Hawkeyes, which
finished sixth and fifth respectively.
Although top-ranked Oklahoma got the bet
ter of Stanford at the MPSFs two weekends
ago, the Cardinal have shown themselves capa
ble of toppling the top team in the nation. They
did just that in early February at the Metroplex
Challenge, when they defeated the Sooners
445.150-442.400 to bounce back from a defeat a
week earlier. Stanford and Oklahoma have met
three times this season, with the Sooners
emerging on top twice. Stanford and Cal have
also met in four meets this year, with the Cardi
nal edging the Golden Bears in all four.
Leading the Cardinal charge into the
NCAAs will be freshman sensation Akash Mo
di, who won MPSF Gymnast of the Year honors
after a tremendous first collegiate season in
which he claimed a pair of MPSF titles in the
all-around and parallel bars as he led the team
with 13 individual victories. He will look to be
the next all-around force on the team after the
graduation of Eddie Penev 'l3 and will try to
replicate Penev's success at the national level.
Outside of Modi, the rest of the Cardinal
squad has also been very solid, leading to top-5
national rankings in the pommel horse (sth),
rings (3rd), vault (4th), parallel bars (2nd) and
high bar (2nd).
Fifth-year senior Paul Hichwa was a signifi
cant part of the Cardinal's success on high bar
as he claimed an MPSF title in the event with a
career-high 15.450. He will look to improve on
his 14.300 at the NCAA Semifinals last season,
which placed him ninth and was significantly be
low his season average in the event.
Success on rings will also
not be a problem if sopho
more Dennis Zaremski can
carry through his success
from the MPSFs into the
NCAAs. At the conference
championships, Zaremski
finished as the runner-up in
the rings with a career-high

16.150, which would have
been good enough to win the
individual national title in the
event last year.
Senior Michael Levy on
floor, senior Sean Senters on
vault and junior Brian Knott
will also be looking to build
off of strong performances at
the conference champi
onships to propel the Cardi
nal to a Friday final berth.
With a top-three finish in
today's semifinals, Stanford
would advance to a tough fi

nal that will likely include de
fending national champion
No. 2 Michigan, to whom the
Cardinal have already suf
fered a defeat to earlier this
season at home. The first
session of the NCAA Cham
pionships will begin at 10
a.m., with the finals to take
place at 4 p.m. tomorrow and
the individual finals set to
start at 4 p.m. on Saturday.

Success on rings will also
not be a problem if sopho
more Dennis Zaremski can
carry through his success
from the MPSFs into the
NCAAs. At the conference
championships, Zaremski
finished as the runner-up in
the rings with a career-high

16.150, which would have
been good enough to win the
individual national title in the
event last year.
Senior Michael Levy on
floor, senior Sean Senters on
vault and junior Brian Knott
will also be looking to build
off of strong performances at
the conference champi
onships to propel the Cardi
nal to a Friday final berth.
With a top-three finish in
today's semifinals, Stanford
would advance to a tough fi

nal that will likely include de
fending national champion
No. 2 Michigan, to whom the
Cardinal have already suf
fered a defeat to earlier this
season at home. The first
session of the NCAA Cham
pionships will begin at 10
a.m., with the finals to take
place at 4 p.m. tomorrow and
the individual finals set to
start at 4 p.m. on Saturday.
