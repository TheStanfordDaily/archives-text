# CARD HUNGRY FOR HUSKIES
## 
### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The road through Pac-12 conference play is
often a daunting journey, filled with matchups
against some of the most talented and experi
enced teams in the entire country. For the
Stanford softball team, the path forward does
not get any easier, as the Cardinal (24-14, 1-8
Pac-12) prepare to welcome the No. 10 Wash
ington Huskies (22-10, 2-6 Pac-12) to the Farm
this weekend. After squaring off against two
top-10 squads, namely No. 6 Arizona State (35-
6, 9-3 Pac-12) and No. 9 Arizona (32-8, 7-5 Pac
-12), in their last two Pac-12 series, the Card
will face a third-consecutive top-10 foe in the
Huskies.

Stanford desperately needs to protect its
home turf this weekend against Washington,
as the Cardinal must boost a postseason profile
that currently lacks a marquee win in confer
ence. The upcoming series against the Huskies
provides the perfect opportunity to mitigate
this problem; wins over Washington would also
raise the Card's RPI, which currently stands
at 51 after last weekend's sweep at the hands
of Arizona.
While Stanford has had its struggles on the
road so far in Pac-12 play, the Cardinal have
done a great job of protecting their home turf
this season, posting an 11-3 record in 2014
within the friendly confines of Smith Family

Junior outfielder Leah White (above) will help lead the Cardinal against the Washington Huskies
this weekend at Smith Family Stadium. The Phoenix native leads her team in stolen bases with
14 on the season. White is also hitting .373 with 26 RBIs and nine extra-base hits.
Stadium. The Card's success
at home, coupled with Wash
ington's poor start to its
road conference slate, would
seemingly give the Cardinal
the chance they need to get
back on track.
Washington, in facing off
against the Cardinal, will al
so have to combat the poten
tial effects of a long layoff;
the Huskies have not played
a game since April 1, and
have not played a Pac-12 foe
this month. Furthermore, in
the Huskies' last Pac-12 se
ries against Oregon at the
end of March, Washington
turned in a very poor offen
sive performance, only scor
ing three combined runs in
being swept by the Ducks.
Washington will certainly
have to score more runs this
weekend to keep up with a
Cardinal offense that is hit
ting .323 on the season and
averaging nearly 6.5 runs
per game.

While Washington may
be struggling offensively
since the start of Pac-12 play,
senior Victoria Hayward has
had an outstanding season
for the Huskies at the plate.
In taking on the Cardinal,
Hayward is making another
homecoming to the Bay
Area, as the 2013 First Team
All-Pac-12 selection went to
Mountain View High School
before matriculating to
Washington. Hayward is
currently hitting .439 on the
season with 16 RBIs and a
.517 on-base percentage.
She is also very dangerous
on the basepaths, having
managed 14 steals this sea
son in 15 attempts.

Washington will also turn
to junior Kylee Lahners on
offense to provide some
power to the Husky lineup.
Lahners, a Laguna Hills,
Calif, product, is ninth in the
Pac-12 in slugging percent
age with a .713 mark. The
2013 Second Team All-Pac
-12 selection has 10 home
runs on the season with 35
RBIs while also posting a
.340 batting average.
In the circle, the Huskies
are led by senior Bryana
Walker. In her final colle
giate campaign, Walker is
third in the Pac-12 in ERA
with a 1.32 mark. In addi
tion, the 2013 First Team
Pac-12 All-Academic selec
tion has earned the win in
nearly 65 percent of the
Huskies' victories this sea
son, managing a 14-6 record
in 22 appearances and 18
starts.
The Cardinal are also
likely to face another senior
pitcher this weekend in 2013
NFCA First Team Ail-
American Kaitlin Inglesby.
While Inglesby has not been
able to replicate the tremen
dous success from her junior
campaign thus far this sea
son, the Portland, Ore. native
has still had a solid season in
the circle for the Huskies.
She currently sports a 2.09
ERA and a 6-3 record in 18
appearances, with 6 com
plete games in 11 starts.
Stanford and Washington
will square off in a three
game series from Thursday
through Saturday at Smith
Family Stadium. The Cardi
nal and Huskies will open
with a night game at 8 p.m.
on Thursday, before playing
on Friday night and Satur
day night at 7 p.m.

ington Huskies (22-10, 2-6 Pac-12) to the Farm
this weekend. After squaring off against two
top-10 squads, namely No. 6 Arizona State (35-
6, 9-3 Pac-12) and No. 9 Arizona (32-8, 7-5 Pac
-12), in their last two Pac-12 series, the Card
will face a third-consecutive top-10 foe in the
Huskies.

Stanford desperately needs to protect its
home turf this weekend against Washington,
as the Cardinal must boost a postseason profile
that currently lacks a marquee win in confer
ence. The upcoming series against the Huskies
provides the perfect opportunity to mitigate
this problem; wins over Washington would also
raise the Card's RPI, which currently stands
at 51 after last weekend's sweep at the hands
of Arizona.
While Stanford has had its struggles on the
road so far in Pac-12 play, the Cardinal have
done a great job of protecting their home turf
this season, posting an 11-3 record in 2014
within the friendly confines of Smith Family

Junior outfielder Leah White (above) will help lead the Cardinal against the Washington Huskies
this weekend at Smith Family Stadium. The Phoenix native leads her team in stolen bases with
14 on the season. White is also hitting .373 with 26 RBIs and nine extra-base hits.
Stadium. The Card's success
at home, coupled with Wash
ington's poor start to its
road conference slate, would
seemingly give the Cardinal
the chance they need to get
back on track.
Washington, in facing off
against the Cardinal, will al
so have to combat the poten
tial effects of a long layoff;
the Huskies have not played
a game since April 1, and
have not played a Pac-12 foe
this month. Furthermore, in
the Huskies' last Pac-12 se
ries against Oregon at the
end of March, Washington
turned in a very poor offen
sive performance, only scor
ing three combined runs in
being swept by the Ducks.
Washington will certainly
have to score more runs this
weekend to keep up with a
Cardinal offense that is hit
ting .323 on the season and
averaging nearly 6.5 runs
per game.

While Washington may
be struggling offensively
since the start of Pac-12 play,
senior Victoria Hayward has
had an outstanding season
for the Huskies at the plate.
In taking on the Cardinal,
Hayward is making another
homecoming to the Bay
Area, as the 2013 First Team
All-Pac-12 selection went to
Mountain View High School
before matriculating to
Washington. Hayward is
currently hitting .439 on the
season with 16 RBIs and a
.517 on-base percentage.
She is also very dangerous
on the basepaths, having
managed 14 steals this sea
son in 15 attempts.

Washington will also turn
to junior Kylee Lahners on
offense to provide some
power to the Husky lineup.
Lahners, a Laguna Hills,
Calif, product, is ninth in the
Pac-12 in slugging percent
age with a .713 mark. The
2013 Second Team All-Pac
-12 selection has 10 home
runs on the season with 35
RBIs while also posting a
.340 batting average.
In the circle, the Huskies
are led by senior Bryana
Walker. In her final colle
giate campaign, Walker is
third in the Pac-12 in ERA
with a 1.32 mark. In addi
tion, the 2013 First Team
Pac-12 All-Academic selec
tion has earned the win in
nearly 65 percent of the
Huskies' victories this sea
son, managing a 14-6 record
in 22 appearances and 18
starts.
The Cardinal are also
likely to face another senior
pitcher this weekend in 2013
NFCA First Team Ail-
American Kaitlin Inglesby.
While Inglesby has not been
able to replicate the tremen
dous success from her junior
campaign thus far this sea
son, the Portland, Ore. native
has still had a solid season in
the circle for the Huskies.
She currently sports a 2.09
ERA and a 6-3 record in 18
appearances, with 6 com
plete games in 11 starts.
Stanford and Washington
will square off in a three
game series from Thursday
through Saturday at Smith
Family Stadium. The Cardi
nal and Huskies will open
with a night game at 8 p.m.
on Thursday, before playing
on Friday night and Satur
day night at 7 p.m.

The road through Pac-12 conference play is
often a daunting journey, filled with matchups
against some of the most talented and experi
enced teams in the entire country. For the
Stanford softball team, the path forward does
not get any easier, as the Cardinal (24-14, 1-8
Pac-12) prepare to welcome the No. 10 Wash
ington Huskies (22-10, 2-6 Pac-12) to the Farm
this weekend. After squaring off against two
