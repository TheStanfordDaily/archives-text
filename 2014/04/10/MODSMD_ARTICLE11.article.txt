# CARD HUNGRY FOR HUSKIES
## 
### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The road through Pac-12 conference play is
often a daunting journey, filled with matchups
against some of the most talented and experi
enced teams in the entire country. For the
Stanford softball team, the path forward does
not get any easier, as the Cardinal (24-14, 1-8
Pac-12) prepare to welcome the No. 10 Wash
ington Huskies (22-10, 2-6 Pac-12) to the Farm
this weekend. After squaring off against two
top-10 squads, namely No. 6 Arizona State (35-
6, 9-3 Pac-12) and No. 9 Arizona (32-8, 7-5 Pac
-12), in their last two Pac-12 series, the Card
will face a third-consecutive top-10 foe in the
Huskies.

Stanford desperately needs to protect its
home turf this weekend against Washington,
as the Cardinal must boost a postseason profile
that currently lacks a marquee win in confer
ence. The upcoming series against the Huskies
provides the perfect opportunity to mitigate
this problem; wins over Washington would also
raise the Card's RPI, which currently stands
at 51 after last weekend's sweep at the hands
of Arizona.
While Stanford has had its struggles on the
road so far in Pac-12 play, the Cardinal have
done a great job of protecting their home turf
this season, posting an 11-3 record in 2014
within the friendly confines of Smith Family
