As the No. 12 Stanford Cardinal prepare to take
the field on the road this Friday against the un
ranked Oregon Ducks, Stanford will try to keep its
grip in the top half of the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation (MPSF) after having fared well this sea
son, going 9-2 and 3-1 in MPSF play, with its only two
losses each coming by only one goal.
The first was a close overtime 16-15 loss to Van
derbilt early in the season, while the second was a 13-
12 squeaker to Denver last weekend that got away
from the Cardinal despite jumping out to a 6-0 lead
early in the match.
In their matchup against the Ducks, the Card will
be looking for a sound victory that will help generate
some momentum to carry them through the back
half of their season and into the MPSF Champi
onships, with the brunt of the difficulty in their
schedule already having passed them by the form of
Denver and No. 6 Notre Dame in the last few weeks.
A large contributor to the Cardinal's success this
season has been the offense, which has recorded
double-digit goals in every match but one, an 8-7
overtime win against Towson. The scoring offense
currently ranks 19th in the nation with 13.36 goals
per game, second in the conference behind just Ore
gon.
Junior midfielder Hannah Farr has led the scor
ing for the Cardinal, with 20 goals to her name this
season. In addition, the Stanford offense has been
spreading out the scoring very efficiently this year,
with five other players having scored double-digit
goals this season as well.
The defense has been stellar as well, limiting op
posing offenses to just 98 goals this season for a
mark of 8.9 goals per game, while tallying 61 saves.
This combination of well-rounded offense and solid
defense has made the Cardinal a formidable team in
the thick of the hunt for the MPSF championship.
