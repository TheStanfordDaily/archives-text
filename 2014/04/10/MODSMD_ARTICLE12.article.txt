# Pushing back to the top

As the No. 12 Stanford Cardinal prepare to take
the field on the road this Friday against the un
ranked Oregon Ducks, Stanford will try to keep its
grip in the top half of the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation (MPSF) after having fared well this sea
son, going 9-2 and 3-1 in MPSF play, with its only two
losses each coming by only one goal.
The first was a close overtime 16-15 loss to Van
derbilt early in the season, while the second was a 13-
12 squeaker to Denver last weekend that got away
from the Cardinal despite jumping out to a 6-0 lead
early in the match.
In their matchup against the Ducks, the Card will
be looking for a sound victory that will help generate
some momentum to carry them through the back
half of their season and into the MPSF Champi
onships, with the brunt of the difficulty in their
schedule already having passed them by the form of
Denver and No. 6 Notre Dame in the last few weeks.
A large contributor to the Cardinal's success this
season has been the offense, which has recorded
double-digit goals in every match but one, an 8-7
overtime win against Towson. The scoring offense
currently ranks 19th in the nation with 13.36 goals
per game, second in the conference behind just Ore
gon.
Junior midfielder Hannah Farr has led the scor
ing for the Cardinal, with 20 goals to her name this
season. In addition, the Stanford offense has been
spreading out the scoring very efficiently this year,
with five other players having scored double-digit
goals this season as well.
The defense has been stellar as well, limiting op
posing offenses to just 98 goals this season for a
mark of 8.9 goals per game, while tallying 61 saves.
This combination of well-rounded offense and solid
defense has made the Cardinal a formidable team in
the thick of the hunt for the MPSF championship.

Junior midfielder Hannah Farr (above) is an instrumental part of the Cardinal's offense,
having collected 20 goals this season and four assists for 24 points and a .500 shot
percentage. Last year, Farr was the MPSF Tournament's Most Outstanding Player.
The last time out on Sun
day, the Cardinal overtook
Colorado 13-5 thanks in part
to Megan Lerner's eight
draw controls, three forced
turnovers and three ground
ball retrievals. With barely 23
minutes gone, the Card had
already built a 5-0 lead on a
Colorado team in its first sea
son as a varsity lacrosse pro
gram. Stanford received con
tributions from all around the
board, with nine different
Cardinal scoring to con
tribute to the victory.
Taking down Oregon will
be no easy task. The Ducks
have posted impressive of
fensive numbers this year,
having averaged 15.27 goals
per game this season, good
for seventh in the country.
With an overall record of 7-4,
the Ducks have shown that
they do have some weak
nesses, though they have
been more formidable at
home, where they have lost
only once. They will enter
the matchup against Stan
ford on a three-game win
ning streak, with then' last
loss this season having come
against a top-25 opponent in
No. 18 Ohio State.
A key for the Card will be
handling Shannon Propst,
the leading scorer for Ore
gon. With 22 goals this sea
son, Propst has proven her
self a dominant force in the
attack. Not only is she
strong in the attack, howev
er, she also spreads the ball
around well, chalking up 33
assists this season. It will be
critical for junior Rachel
Kalick and the rest of the
Stanford defense to keep a
lid on this explosive Oregon
offense.
The Cardinal will take on
the Ducks in Eugene, Ore.
on Friday at 5 p.m.
