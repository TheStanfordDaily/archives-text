## STUDENTS OF COLOR COALITION unSAFE Reform 
### 
Incomplete: a term synony
mous with the current SAFE
Reform Initiative. While some
have publicized the bill's potential
to "completely overhaul the current
student activities funding system,"
they have neglected the holes that
exist. Although it is necessary to
solve the increasing undergraduate
student activities fee, SAFE Re
form hastily attempts to do some
thing, overlooking the potential
side-effects of its conflicting lan
guage. We, the Students of Color
Coalition (SOCC), have done our
due diligence and identified a num
ber of holes in the discourse sur
rounding the bill. As such, SOCC
does not support SAFE Reform.
We applaud the tireless efforts
of those working to rectify the cur
rent system's failures. Najla Gomez
'l4 and NAACP Presidents Melvin
Boone 'l4 and Tianay Pulphus 'l3
have been meeting with the authors
of the SAFE Reform bill, Justine
'l6 and Olivia Moore 'l6, to create a
funding solution since the Moore
twins were first hired by Stephen
Trusheim 'l3 M.S. 'l4 last year.
However, the bill remains unable to
answer fundamental concerns re
lating to student groups.
The main issues with the bill re
volve around the funding board, its
selection process and accountabili
ty for its decisions. While a number
of bill advocates have stated that
the funding board will be com
prised of seven students, including
three unelected members and four
senators, the bill's language leaves
room for other possibilities.
Specifically, Article I\£ entitled
"Appointments," states: "Four
[members of the board] shall be
elected representatives of the stu
dent body as members of the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate, and three
shall be appointed by the outgoing
Funding Board." However, Appen
dix 11, Section 2, states: "The Fund
ing Board shall be comprised of at
least seven members, at least three
of whom shall not hold elected of
fice in the Association." As such,
the final composition of the board
could he less representative than
publicized, with a larger portion of
the board than in previous years
being appointed rather than elect
ed members. The bill is unclear on
how the board, which decides the
allocation of undergraduate activity
fees, will be chosen, increasing bu
reaucracy and reducing democracy
in student group funding. This in
consistent language highlights the
hasty manner in which this bill was
composed, and the dangers of al
lowing such ambiguity to become
part of the ASSU constitution.

We believe in our communities
and our value on this campus. So of
ten SOCC groups have to remind
students and others that our cultur
al activities matter to the entire
Stanford community. That some
how our events do not engage the
greater Stanford community is a
troubling misconception. With that
in mind, it concerns us that this bill
currently lacks any metrics on how
events will be evaluated for ap
proval. This extends beyond SOCC
communities into all other student
groups that rely on Stanford for
funding. Specifically, the future dis
tribution of the new quick and mi
nor grants is unclear, as the bill does
not provide any criteria that will al
low the Funding Board to deter
mine which events to fund. Without
an explicit framework, the Funding

Board's decisions will depend on its
composition and individual subjec
tivities. This further demonstrates
how the SAFE Reform is not yet
ready for implementation.
As student leaders, we cannot,
in good conscience, advocate for a
bill that leaves room for error. On
several occasions, SOCC leader
ship reached out directly to the bill
co-authors to express our concerns.
We requested to postpone the vote
on the bill to better educate the stu
dent body and resolve the bill's re
maining unpolished components.
However, our request was rejected
and we have been told that the bil
l's current issues can be fixed after
approval.
This course of action is not in
the interest of student groups. As
we have stated and will continue to
state, we believe in submitting a
complete bill to be voted upon by
the student body, rather than a
vague framework lacking specifics
in crucial areas we have questions.
SOCC believes in working on
SAFE Reform further in order to
provide a comprehensive bill for
the Stanford student body.
Though the current funding sys
tem needs to be improved, a hasty
fix is not the answer. While some
may argue that SOCC's "No" Cam
paign against SAFE Reform relies
heavily on speculation, we cannot
help but speculate about a bill that
leaves its most important features
to the whim of our successors.
Nothing about that scenario seems
SAFE at all.

Nothing about that scenario seems

We believe in
submitting a
complete bill,
rather than a
vague framework
lacking specifics.

Incomplete: a term synony
mous with the current SAFE
Reform Initiative. While some
have publicized the bill's potential
to "completely overhaul the current
student activities funding system,"
they have neglected the holes that
exist. Although it is necessary to
solve the increasing undergraduate
student activities fee, SAFE Re
form hastily attempts to do some
thing, overlooking the potential
side-effects of its conflicting lan
guage. We, the Students of Color
Coalition (SOCC), have done our
due diligence and identified a num
ber of holes in the discourse sur
rounding the bill. As such, SOCC
does not support SAFE Reform.
We applaud the tireless efforts
of those working to rectify the cur
rent system's failures. Najla Gomez
'l4 and NAACP Presidents Melvin
Boone 'l4 and Tianay Pulphus 'l3
have been meeting with the authors
of the SAFE Reform bill, Justine
'l6 and Olivia Moore 'l6, to create a
funding solution since the Moore
twins were first hired by Stephen
Trusheim 'l3 M.S. 'l4 last year.
However, the bill remains unable to
answer fundamental concerns re
lating to student groups.
The main issues with the bill re
volve around the funding board, its
selection process and accountabili
ty for its decisions. While a number
of bill advocates have stated that
the funding board will be com
prised of seven students, including
three unelected members and four
senators, the bill's language leaves
room for other possibilities.
Specifically, Article I\£ entitled
"Appointments," states: "Four
[members of the board] shall be
elected representatives of the stu
dent body as members of the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate, and three
shall be appointed by the outgoing
Funding Board." However, Appen
dix 11, Section 2, states: "The Fund
ing Board shall be comprised of at
least seven members, at least three
of whom shall not hold elected of
fice in the Association." As such,
the final composition of the board
could he less representative than
publicized, with a larger portion of
the board than in previous years
being appointed rather than elect
ed members. The bill is unclear on
how the board, which decides the
allocation of undergraduate activity
fees, will be chosen, increasing bu
reaucracy and reducing democracy
in student group funding. This in
consistent language highlights the
hasty manner in which this bill was
composed, and the dangers of al
lowing such ambiguity to become
part of the ASSU constitution.

We believe in our communities
and our value on this campus. So of
ten SOCC groups have to remind
students and others that our cultur
al activities matter to the entire
Stanford community. That some
how our events do not engage the
greater Stanford community is a
troubling misconception. With that
in mind, it concerns us that this bill
currently lacks any metrics on how
events will be evaluated for ap
proval. This extends beyond SOCC
communities into all other student
groups that rely on Stanford for
funding. Specifically, the future dis
tribution of the new quick and mi
nor grants is unclear, as the bill does
not provide any criteria that will al
low the Funding Board to deter
mine which events to fund. Without
an explicit framework, the Funding

Board's decisions will depend on its
composition and individual subjec
tivities. This further demonstrates
how the SAFE Reform is not yet
ready for implementation.
As student leaders, we cannot,
in good conscience, advocate for a
bill that leaves room for error. On
several occasions, SOCC leader
ship reached out directly to the bill
co-authors to express our concerns.
We requested to postpone the vote
on the bill to better educate the stu
dent body and resolve the bill's re
maining unpolished components.
However, our request was rejected
and we have been told that the bil
l's current issues can be fixed after
approval.
This course of action is not in
the interest of student groups. As
we have stated and will continue to
state, we believe in submitting a
complete bill to be voted upon by
the student body, rather than a
vague framework lacking specifics
in crucial areas we have questions.
