# Fossil fuel divestment: Stanford's unique role in a global movement
## 
### Graham Provost 
This week, Stanford under
graduates will vote on a refer
endum calling on the Univer
sity to divest its endowment from
the fossil fuel industry. Representa
tives of the undergraduate student
body on the ASSU Senate have al
ready voted by a wide margin to
support divestment, but this is a
chance for all students to make
their voices heard.
Stanford students are not alone
in supporting divestment. Harvard
passed a similar referendum with
72 percent support, Berkeley with
73 percent and Yale with 83 per
cent. Dozens of other schools have
done the same. Nine schools, most
ly small liberal arts colleges, have
already committed to divest.
Colleges and universities have a
critical role to play in creating in
vesting norms, but there are many
other institutions considering or
enacting divestment. More than 20
cities, including Seattle, have com

mitted to divest their pension funds
from fossil fuel companies. For
many religious institutions, divest
ment has served as a strong moral
statement, and many foundations
have too recognized the value of di
vesting. In fact, this January, 17
philanthropic foundations holding
$l.B billion in assets joined togeth
er to pull their investments out of
the fossil fuel industry.
Divestment is also being consid
ered and promoted on a much larg
er scale. Several large banks, in
cluding Deutsche Bank and
Rabobank, have already begun
eliminating their most carbon-in
tensive investments, and the U.K.
Parliament recently warned the
Bank of England that fossil fuel
companies may be massively over
valued. Investment leaders such as
Stanford trustee Tom Steyer, who
until recently led one of the world's
most successful hedge funds, and
Mindy Lubber, director of the $ll

trillion Investor Network on Cli
mate Risk, have touted both the
moral and financial benefits of di
vesting.
Even those who have historical
ly benefited greatly from fossil fuel
extraction are recognizing that fos
sil fuels may no longer be the right
investment. Norway is currently
studying the possibility of divesting
its $B4O billion sovereign wealth
fund, the world's largest sovereign
fund, and has already created re
quirements for investment in re
newable energy.
Despite all of this momentum
toward divestment from fossil fu
els, no major U.S. university has
yet committed to divest. An impor
tant reason for this lack of institu
tional courage is simply that it is
difficult to be the first. While a
growing body of research shows
that a strong fossil-free portfolio is
possible, the logistics may be a
challenge for the first major uni
versity to divest, and administra
tors are hesitant to break with their
peer institutions.
Stanford must not be hindered
by the inertia of doing things the
way they have always been done,
nor by the fear of being different
from other top universities. Stan
ford prides itself on being a leader
and an innovator, and now is a time
to lead. The fact that other univer
sities have yet to divest gives Stan
ford an opportunity, not only to be
first, but to spark a transformation.
If Stanford commits to divesting
from fossil fuels, it will clear the
way for dozens or hundreds of oth
er universities to do the same.
According to researchers at Ox
ford, every previous divestment
movement, including those against
Apartheid South Africa, tobacco
companies and companies support
ing genocide in Darfur, has been
successful in motivating restrictive
legislation. If Stanford can lead a
movement that drives the U.S. to
implement strong climate policies,
we will have taken a significant and
unprecedented step toward ad
dressing the challenge of our time.
