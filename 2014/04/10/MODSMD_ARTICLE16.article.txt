# THE 						HUMANITIES IN THE 21ST CENTURY April 7-11,2014
## Why history? 
### Jennifer Burns 
As a history professor, I hope students love
my classes so much they decide to declare
a major or minor in the subject. Yet if I suc
ceed, I know my students will hear the inevitable
question: "History, huh. What are you gonna do
with that?"
So I suggest three ways they might respond: a
simple answer, a complicated answer and a philo
sophical answer.
The simple answer is that history majors
have a proven track record of success in any
number of fields, and make excellent lawyers,
consultants, business owners, policy makers, cor
porate executives and so forth. To study history
is to train the mind to assimilate information, rec
ognize patterns and make judgments about what
is most important.
Each lecture, I explain, I will throw a huge
amount of information at my students: dates,
faces, names of legislation, battles, books eco
nomic statistics, etc. Their job will be to sort
through this overload and use it to construct
meaningful arguments about what mattered
most, and why I will teach them to question their
sources, so they are not blind consumers of dubi
ous Internet wisdom. And I will test them on
their ability to assess, evaluate and construct in
terpretations of the past.
All of these skills translate directly into pro
fessional competencies. Would, you, like to be a
diplomat ? I ask. If you get through the first
Foreign Service exam—which will be full of
questions about global history and geography—
you will be placed in a room with a huge stack of
reports, and will have a few hours to reduce these
hundreds of pages to a concise several pages. If
you've taken a history course, you will already
have done this for the research paper and final
exam. Do you want to go into business, be a con
sultant or an analyst? Again, you're going to find
yourself with a stack of reports, or an entire in
dustry to research and a summary due. And
you'll be promoted based on the boss believing
she or he can trust you to have selected out the
most important information, overlooking nothing
relevant, yet presenting it all in a pithy and read
able format.
All the data are clear on this point: history
majors earn comfortable salaries, with most clos
ing the gap with professional majors by peak
earning years. History majors are actually more
likely get into medical school than science ma
jors. And they emerge as leaders in their fields
because they are comfortable with the big-pic
ture thinking and long-term vision that the study
of history cultivates.
Not sure what kind of job you want? This is
where the more complicated answer comes in,
for a history major is training for jobs that do not
yet exist. The simple fact is that most Stanford
students will end up crafting their own roles and
responsibilities in the workplace, rather than fit

ting themselves in like cogs to a machine. To do
this, they'll need boldness, creativity and imagi
nation. And they can foster those habits of mind
and being by thinking deeply about change, con
tinuity and the radical instability of the present
moment.
Studying history underscores the way the fu
ture unfolds out of the past. It teaches students to
sense possibilities where they can't yet be seen,
and in so doing makes it possible to chart a path
into the unknown. Looking at history, you'll un
derstand how new industries emerge and will be
able to craft a career path that intersects with the
emerging economy of tomorrow
History also teaches students to appreciate
and navigate complexity and change. Studying
the past helps students develop judgment, for it
puts before them a panoply of human folly and
achievement that can help guide them in unfamil
iar terrain. Young people learn that the best laid
plans often go awry; that human emotions can
prove the driving force of history; that unintended
consequences are the rule more than the excep
tion; and that injustice is both real and terrible and
can be changed by the actions of a dedicated few
All of this creates a supple intellect that can re
spond to new situations with ease, confidence and
creativity And it is superb preparation for the cus
tomized careers students will craft out of an un
known future.
And then there is the philosophical answer to
"why history?": that historical knowledge is a
good unto itself, and we don't need to "do" any
thing with it, other than to use it to see the world
in a different way, to appreciate its richness and
variety. That is particularly true in courses on
modern America, where we do a slow slide into
the present. In the last few weeks of the course,
I tell students, things will start looking more
and more familiar. But they will also look differ
ent, because now they'll know where eveiyday
features of the present from the vote to the
personal computer—came from, and thus under
stand their true meaning and significance.
I turn to T.S. Eliot for a concluding coda:
We shall, never cease from exploration
And, the end of all our exploring
Will be to arrive where we started
And blow the place for the first time.

In the end, then, history responds to that ancient
Greek injunction, gnothi seauton: know thy
self. It also embodies the original impulse of the
humanities, Geistewissenschaften , or spiritual
studies. For it is only with self-knowledge that we
can become conscious, moral and purposive ac
tors in our own lives. And only by knowing our
selves can we hope to change the world.
