# The 						folly of humanities marketing at Stanford
## 
### Roneil Rumburg 
Much hubbub has
been made recently,
both here in The
Stanford Daily and in other
publications, over the per
ceived focus on vanity entre
preneurship by much of the
student body at Stanford.
The word "entrepreneur
ship" has taken on a heavily
negative connotation among
students here and is now of
ten associated with the pur
suit of wealth and power. And
it certainly feels like more
people are thinking about
business ideas of their own.
But digging deeper, the
motivations of students
working on ideas are often
more pure than people gen
erally give them credit for. I
asked a few students I know
what their motivations were
for pursuing businesses of
their own, and there was one
common thread among all of
their responses: impact.
Many students argue,
convincingly, that the scale of
the impact they can have on
the world by founding a suc
cessful company far exceeds
that of any other opportunity
a fresh college graduate can
pursue. Wealth is certainly
also a motivating factor for
student entrepreneurs, but it
tends to be secondary or ter
tiary in importance to the
pursuit of impact. Common
wisdom among the students I
talked to was that for those
motivated primarily by
wealth, finance or consulting
provide a much higher
chance of success than found
ing a company. The odds are
heavily stacked against any
one who strikes out on then
own, as around 75 percent of
VC-funded companies fail.
The widespread associa
tion between technology and
entrepreneurship is a natural
result of the focus on scale of
impact; a small team, using
little capital, can build tech
nology products that touch

the lives of many millions.
WhatsApp, acquired by
Facebook recently, has
touched the lives of over 450
million users despite only
employing 50 people, all
without spending a cent on
marketing. WhatsApp brought
text messaging to hundreds of
millions of people who wouldn't
have otherwise been able to af
ford it, charging only $1 per
year.
But entrepreneurship
and technology are not fun
damentally intertwined
with one another, and entre
preneurial thinking is often
applied to solving social
problems. For example,
BASES runs a business
plan competition called So
cial E-Challenge, which
gives prize money away to
three companies chosen for
their potential to have a so
cial impact. The d.school al
so runs classes like
ME2O6A/B, which encour
age students to explore op
portunities to create social
ventures. Some of the most
successful companies to
come out of the BASES
competitions, like Kiva,
have come from the Social
E-Challenge program.
So why are many still op
posed to the growth of en
trepreneurship culture at
Stanford? I had an opportu
nity to catch up with Matt
Lopez, a senior at Stanford
and writer of the op-ed I
linked to at the beginning of
this article, and it seems
that the problem stems
from the lack of support giv
en by Stanford to students
pursuing more alternative
paths.
While the path out of
Stanford as a computer sci
ence student is fairly well
worn, and many alumni and
students are available to
support those who follow
such a path, less support ex
ists for those interested in

other fields. Stanford prom
ised students that they
could be successful pursu
ing anything they were in
terested in, but students
having trouble finding their
way after graduation feel
that Stanford has broken
that promise. The continued
growth of entrepreneurship
culture is drawing more and
more focus away from these
alternative paths, exacer
bating this problem.
But this is not an issue
caused by the growth of en
trepreneurship culture at
Stanford. Stanford does not
seem to make more re
sources available to engi
neering students than it
does to students in other de
partments, but economic
forces have given entrepre
neurial engineering stu
dents significantly more op
tions than others seem to
have. The center of gravity
on campus is shifting to
wards the engineering
quad, and to even the play
ing field for students with
alternative aspirations,
Stanford will need to make
more resources available to
those students. How Stan
ford can best fix this is un
clear, but the problem seems
only tangentially related to
entrepreneurship.
What Stanford has right
now is a critical mass of stu
dents primarily interested in
making an impact on the
world, leaving their own
"dent in the universe" how
ever they see fit. Whether
that impact comes through
founding a company, charita
ble work, politics or any oth
er field seems irrelevant, but
Stanford should support stu
dents interested in pursuing
any path they choose.

But entrepreneurship
and technology are not fun
damentally intertwined
with one another, and entre
preneurial thinking is often
applied to solving social
problems. For example,
BASES runs a business
plan competition called So
cial E-Challenge, which
gives prize money away to
three companies chosen for
their potential to have a so
cial impact. The d.school al
so runs classes like
ME2O6A/B, which encour
age students to explore op
portunities to create social
ventures. Some of the most
successful companies to
come out of the BASES
competitions, like Kiva,
have come from the Social
E-Challenge program.
So why are many still op
posed to the growth of en
trepreneurship culture at
Stanford? I had an opportu
nity to catch up with Matt
Lopez, a senior at Stanford
and writer of the op-ed I
linked to at the beginning of
this article, and it seems
that the problem stems
from the lack of support giv
en by Stanford to students
pursuing more alternative
paths.
While the path out of
Stanford as a computer sci
ence student is fairly well
worn, and many alumni and
students are available to
support those who follow
such a path, less support ex
ists for those interested in

other fields. Stanford prom
ised students that they
could be successful pursu
ing anything they were in
terested in, but students
having trouble finding their
way after graduation feel
that Stanford has broken
that promise. The continued
growth of entrepreneurship
culture is drawing more and
more focus away from these
alternative paths, exacer
bating this problem.
But this is not an issue
caused by the growth of en
trepreneurship culture at
Stanford. Stanford does not
seem to make more re
sources available to engi
neering students than it
does to students in other de
partments, but economic
forces have given entrepre
neurial engineering stu
dents significantly more op
tions than others seem to
have. The center of gravity
on campus is shifting to
wards the engineering
quad, and to even the play
ing field for students with
alternative aspirations,
Stanford will need to make
more resources available to
those students. How Stan
ford can best fix this is un
clear, but the problem seems
only tangentially related to
entrepreneurship.
What Stanford has right
now is a critical mass of stu
dents primarily interested in
making an impact on the
world, leaving their own
"dent in the universe" how
ever they see fit. Whether
that impact comes through
founding a company, charita
ble work, politics or any oth
er field seems irrelevant, but
Stanford should support stu
dents interested in pursuing
any path they choose.

Much hubbub has
been made recently,
both here in The
Stanford Daily and in other
publications, over the per
ceived focus on vanity entre
preneurship by much of the
student body at Stanford.
The word "entrepreneur
ship" has taken on a heavily
negative connotation among
students here and is now of
ten associated with the pur
suit of wealth and power. And
it certainly feels like more
people are thinking about
business ideas of their own.
But digging deeper, the
motivations of students
working on ideas are often
more pure than people gen
erally give them credit for. I
asked a few students I know
what their motivations were
for pursuing businesses of
their own, and there was one
common thread among all of
their responses: impact.
Many students argue,
convincingly, that the scale of
the impact they can have on
the world by founding a suc
cessful company far exceeds
that of any other opportunity
a fresh college graduate can
pursue. Wealth is certainly
also a motivating factor for
student entrepreneurs, but it
tends to be secondary or ter
tiary in importance to the
pursuit of impact. Common
wisdom among the students I
talked to was that for those
motivated primarily by
wealth, finance or consulting
provide a much higher
chance of success than found
ing a company. The odds are
heavily stacked against any
one who strikes out on then
own, as around 75 percent of
VC-funded companies fail.
The widespread associa
tion between technology and
entrepreneurship is a natural
result of the focus on scale of
impact; a small team, using
little capital, can build tech
nology products that touch

the lives of many millions.
WhatsApp, acquired by
Facebook recently, has
touched the lives of over 450
million users despite only
employing 50 people, all
without spending a cent on
marketing. WhatsApp brought
text messaging to hundreds of
millions of people who wouldn't
have otherwise been able to af
ford it, charging only $1 per
year.
