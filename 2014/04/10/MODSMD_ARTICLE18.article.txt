# Hitting the home stretch
## 
### FIONA NOONAN STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's and
women's tennis teams will
have a Pacific Northwest
filled weekend as they will
each face teams from Oregon
and Washington as their reg
ular seasons near their con
clusions.
The No. 43 men (10-4, 2-2
Pac-12) will start with Wash
ington (10-10, 1-3 Pac-12) at
home on Friday, followed by
No. 39 Oregon (15-4,2-3 Pac
-12) on Saturday, also at
Taube Family Tennis Stadi
um. After losing to both No.
2 USC and No. 3 UCLA on
the road this past weekend,
the Cardinal got a lift in
beating Cal Poly (7-12, 2-1
Big West) on Tuesday after
noon along with a nine-spot
rankings boost, which should
help team confidence going
into Friday.
Stanford has already tak
en care of Washington this
season, having beaten the
Huskies 4-2 back in January,
and should have no trouble
handling the Huskies again if
the team continues to get
quality play out of the likes

of junior John Morrissey,
who clinched the match
against Cal Poly, and sopho
mores Maciek Romanowicz
and Anthony Tsodikov.
Saturday, the Cardinal
will take on the Ducks in
what will be Oregon's third
and final match of a difficult
four-day California road trip.
They will have already taken
on Pac-12 title contender No.
19 Cal on Friday, which could
prove to be to Stanford's ad
vantage. The Ducks have
struggled in the Pac-12 this
season, getting their second
conference win just last Sat
urday against a flailing Ari
zona squad. After Oregon
fell 12 spots in the rankings
this Tuesday, Stanford could
be in prime position to beat a
shaky Ducks team that
cranked an 11-match win
ning streak earlier this sea
son before running into USC
and UCLA.
Meanwhile, the No. 7
women will go on the road
for the final time this season
to face Oregon (7-11,1-6 Pac
-12) in Eugene on Friday and
No. 47 Washington State (11-
8, 1-7 Pac-12) in Seattle on
Saturday.

The Cardinal had a tough
series last weekend against
No. 2 UCLA and No. 3 USC,
one that saw them lose for
the first time this season in
falling to UCLA on Friday.
They will look to avenge
their tumble in the rankings
against the lowly Ducks, who
have now lost four straight
matches, including three in a
row in conference, including
most recently a defeat to the
Huskies.
With nine shutouts al
ready under their belts, the
Cardinal could easily enter
double digits in that catego
ry against Oregon on Friday
if they maintain their focus
and are able to bounce back
to their consistently winning
ways.
The Huskies have had an
equally tough time as of late,
beating only Oregon in con
ference play. They will face
Stanford in the second of a
pair of matches that begins
with No. 6 Cal, which now
leads the Pac-12 standings
after taking down both USC
and UCLA this past week
end.

If Stanford continues
with the nearly flawless play

that has characterized most
of this season, this final road
trip shouldn't pose a problem
for the Cardinal. Senior
Kristie Ahn, ranked fourth in
the country, has stayed
strong for the team all sea
son in singles. Despite slip
ping two places in the rank
ings after losing to UCLA's
No. 2 Robin Anderson, she
will continue to provide a
strong leadership presence
for the young Stanford
squad.
The team's three fresh
men, No. 22 Carol Zhao, No.
28 Taylor Davidson and No.
41 Caroline Doyle, have been
rock solid all year, and with
all Stanford six singles play
ers ranked in the top 50 in
the nation, the Ducks and
Huskies should pose little
threat to the still-burgeoning
Cardinal.
The Stanford men will
start off the weekend against
Washington at 1:30 p.m. on
Friday at Taube Family Ten
nis Center, while the women
will face Oregon at noon on
Friday in Eugene, Oregon.

beating only Oregon in con
ference play. They will face
Stanford in the second of a
pair of matches that begins
with No. 6 Cal, which now
leads the Pac-12 standings
after taking down both USC
and UCLA this past week
end.

If Stanford continues
with the nearly flawless play

that has characterized most
of this season, this final road
trip shouldn't pose a problem
for the Cardinal. Senior
Kristie Ahn, ranked fourth in
the country, has stayed
strong for the team all sea
son in singles. Despite slip
ping two places in the rank
ings after losing to UCLA's
No. 2 Robin Anderson, she
will continue to provide a
strong leadership presence
for the young Stanford
squad.
The team's three fresh
men, No. 22 Carol Zhao, No.
28 Taylor Davidson and No.
41 Caroline Doyle, have been
rock solid all year, and with
all Stanford six singles play
ers ranked in the top 50 in
the nation, the Ducks and
Huskies should pose little
threat to the still-burgeoning
Cardinal.
The Stanford men will
start off the weekend against
Washington at 1:30 p.m. on
Friday at Taube Family Ten
nis Center, while the women
will face Oregon at noon on
Friday in Eugene, Oregon.

Junior John Morrissey (above) played an instrumental role in the Cardinal's 4-2 victory over Cal Poly on Tuesday as he
bounced back from a tough first-set tiebreak loss to dominate the rest of the match and give Stanford the deciding point.
The Stanford men's and
women's tennis teams will
have a Pacific Northwest
filled weekend as they will
each face teams from Oregon
and Washington as their reg
ular seasons near their con
clusions.
The No. 43 men (10-4, 2-2
Pac-12) will start with Wash
ington (10-10, 1-3 Pac-12) at
home on Friday, followed by
No. 39 Oregon (15-4,2-3 Pac
-12) on Saturday, also at
Taube Family Tennis Stadi
um. After losing to both No.
2 USC and No. 3 UCLA on
the road this past weekend,
the Cardinal got a lift in
beating Cal Poly (7-12, 2-1
Big West) on Tuesday after
noon along with a nine-spot
rankings boost, which should
help team confidence going
into Friday.
Stanford has already tak
en care of Washington this
season, having beaten the
Huskies 4-2 back in January,
and should have no trouble
handling the Huskies again if
the team continues to get
quality play out of the likes

of junior John Morrissey,
who clinched the match
against Cal Poly, and sopho
mores Maciek Romanowicz
and Anthony Tsodikov.
Saturday, the Cardinal
will take on the Ducks in
what will be Oregon's third
and final match of a difficult
four-day California road trip.
They will have already taken
on Pac-12 title contender No.
19 Cal on Friday, which could
prove to be to Stanford's ad
vantage. The Ducks have
struggled in the Pac-12 this
season, getting their second
conference win just last Sat
urday against a flailing Ari
zona squad. After Oregon
fell 12 spots in the rankings
this Tuesday, Stanford could
be in prime position to beat a
shaky Ducks team that
cranked an 11-match win
ning streak earlier this sea
son before running into USC
and UCLA.
Meanwhile, the No. 7
women will go on the road
for the final time this season
to face Oregon (7-11,1-6 Pac
-12) in Eugene on Friday and
No. 47 Washington State (11-
8, 1-7 Pac-12) in Seattle on
Saturday.

The Cardinal had a tough
series last weekend against
No. 2 UCLA and No. 3 USC,
one that saw them lose for
the first time this season in
falling to UCLA on Friday.
They will look to avenge
their tumble in the rankings
against the lowly Ducks, who
have now lost four straight
matches, including three in a
row in conference, including
most recently a defeat to the
Huskies.
With nine shutouts al
ready under their belts, the
Cardinal could easily enter
double digits in that catego
ry against Oregon on Friday
if they maintain their focus
and are able to bounce back
to their consistently winning
ways.
The Huskies have had an
equally tough time as of late,
beating only Oregon in con
ference play. They will face
Stanford in the second of a
pair of matches that begins
with No. 6 Cal, which now
leads the Pac-12 standings
after taking down both USC
and UCLA this past week
end.
