# Knight Fellow backs female Afghan journalists
## Sahar Speaks aims to increase reporting by women 
### ALEXA LIAUTAUD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As U.S. troops gradually with
draw from Afghanistan and as the
country nears a pivotal presidential
election, gender roles and the status
of women in Afghanistan have been
thrown into uncertainty. Amidst
that disruption, Amie Ferris-Rot
man 'l4, a John S. Knight Journal
ism Fellow, has launched an initia
tive that aims increase the number
of local Afghan female journalists
working for international news
agencies.
The Sahar Speaks project is a
one-year, three-part mentorship and
training program that will allow as
piring local female journalists to join
agencies and produce investigate
first-person reporting on the ongo
ing war. Ferris-Rotman said that
she was inspired to develop the proj
ect while working as a foreign corre
spondent in Kabul for Reuters for
two years.

"The more I looked around
looked at The New York Times,
looked at BBC, looked at the Associ
ated Press, all the major foreign
news outlets that were operating
out of Kabul I realized that none
of them hire local Afghan female re
porters," Ferris-Rotman said.
Even so, there are a significant
number of female reporters in
Afghanistan. According to Ferris-
Rotman, there are almost over 2,000
Afghan female reporters in the
country, but the majority of them
work for local news, television and
radio.
"None of them worked for for
eign news outlets. To me, this just
seemed like a total disaster," she
said. "It was heartbreaking as well
because we weren't getting proper
stories about women out."

Afghan-American filmmaker
Miriam Arghandiwal, who interned
for Reuters in Kabul while Ferris-
Rotman was a senior correspon
dent, described her experience

working for a foreign news agency
as a lonely one and emphasized the
value of projects like Sahar Speaks.
"I was probably one of the only
Afghan females employed by inter
national news agencies," Arghandi
wal said. 'Afghanistan is the most
dangerous place in the world to be a
woman and the road to actually try
to access these women, and know
their stories and their pain, is so
complex and so dire to understand.
Afghan women can understand that
better than anyone else."
Both Arghandiwal and Ferris-
Rotman were adamant about the
need for more investment in the se
curity of the women in order to en
sure any range of success.
"We need to go the extra step to
get them to work," Arghandiwal ex
plained. "They need our investment
in them. It's not like they're going to
walk into our bureaus and be really
assertive."
"It's something that can happen
but you need news organizations

that are willing to go the hard way.
You have to stand up for women that
are working for you and that [en
sure] their security needs are being
taken care of," Arghandiwal said.
The project one of 21 other

Knight fellow projects is current
ly in the process of seeking partner
ships, non-profits and grants with
which to move forward. Ferris-Rot-
