# Q&A KHARIS TEMPLEMAN TAIWAN DEMOCRACY PROJECT AT THE FREEMAN SPOGLI INSTITUTE
## 
### EDWARD NGAI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Kharis Templeman, program manager for the
Taiwan Democracy Project at the Freeman
Spogli Institute for International Studies (FSI),
studies democratization, dominant-party elec
toral regimes and Pacific Asia. As a Taiwan schol
ar, he has keenly followed the protest movement
that occupied the Legislative Yuan on March 18,
paralyzing the government.
The student-driven protest, dubbed the "Sun
flower Movement," opposes a trade deal with
China that could significantly open up both
economies to cross-Strait investment. Yesterday,
student leaders claiming victory decided to end
the protest on Thursday.
The Daily sat down with Templeman to dis
cuss the situation, its strategic implications and
what these events mean for the state of democra
cy worldwide.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): The protesters in
side the Legislative Yuan and riot police at
tempting to keep order outside make for a
veiy surreal scene, especially in highly-cosmo
politan Taipei. Can you explain what sparked
this conflict?
Kharis Templeman (KT): Put simply, there is
a trade agreement between Taiwan and the Peo
ple's Republic of China being reviewed by the
legislature. There was a dispute about the proce
dure under which that trade agreement should
be reviewed: one side declared that the agree

ment had unilaterally taken effect or that it
would because the legislature had not acted on it.
That caused an uproar from a lot of people, and
there were a series of student protests in opposi
tion to this agreement, and then some students
rushed into the legislature and started a sit-in.

TSD: Students, claiming victory, say that they
have made significant progress towards their
political goals and that "the world has heard
the news." Have they really "won?"
KT: I think it's too early to tell. As I under
stand it, they are leaving the legislature because
the speaker of the legislature made a public
statement supporting them position, their core
demand that the cross-Strait services trade
agreement not be reviewed until there's a mech
anism set up [with one provision that] the legisla
ture actually has a vote on whether the agree
ment takes effect.
But the Ma administration hasn't accepted
that demand and wants the current agreement
exempt from any changes. A lot depends on
whether the speaker [of the Legislative Yuan]
keeps his word, and how many [governing party]
Kuomintang (KMT) legislators stick with the
president.
As for relations with media, part of the prob
lem is that the media in Taiwan itself is highly
partisan. Imagine Fox News on steroids. There's
a clear partisan slant to most coverage, and it's
hard to get good accurate information, particu
larly about what political actors are doing and
what their motives are.

I don't think the students had a concerted
plan to do this ahead of time. Once they got into
the legislature, there was the "now what" ques
tion. To then* credit, they've quickly had a couple
student leaders step up and have been fairly or
ganized and disciplined in their message to the
media.

TSD: Taipei has a reputation for being a pret
ty rowdy place to be a legislator. To what ex
tent is this dramatic protest with legisla
tors themselves physically blocking the podi
um to prevent sessions from being gavelled in
an only-in-Taiwan phenomenon?
KT: You'll see legislators in the middle of what

looks like a rugby scrum,
pushing and shoving each
other, and the session eventu
ally breaks down and every
body leaves, and oftentimes
they meet afterwards for cof
fee. It's all an act for televi
sion.
In Taiwan, there's an insti
tutional incentive to cause
chaos on the legislative floor
and in committee. That in
centive comes from this pe
culiar institution called the
Cross-Party Negotiating
Committee, which brings to
gether the leaders of all the
major party caucuses, even
when one party has a large
majority If there's an agree
ment within that committee,
every caucus leader is sup
posed to guarantee that
their caucus will not throw a
fit. If there isn't an agree
ment, or if the agreement is
violated, the minority party
can prevent the legislative
business of the day from be
ing conducted by starting
fights or boycotting. In ef
fect, it works kind of like the
filibuster in the U.S. Senate.
The other part of this
story is that the speaker of
the Legislative Yuan has so
far not used police force to
clear a path to the podium.
In effect, he's allowing this
to go on.

TSD: Can you situate these
recent developments with
in the broader context of
global democracy? What
might Taiwanese democ

racy look like in the fu
ture?
KT: The optimistic an
swer has to do with the larg
er picture of Taiwan's politi
cal situation. It's come a
long way from 25 years ago.
And sometimes, the mo
ments at which there have
been major steps forward
have involved these kinds of
confrontations over core
parts of democratic proce
dure. Getting, for instance,
the "ten-thousand-year Con
gress" to step down in 1992,
required demonstrations in
the streets. So, in a sense,
there's a deeper game here
having do to with how Tai
wan's institutions should
work. My optimistic take is
that this creates at least an
opportunity to scrutinize in
stitutions again and develop
some important changes

that will benefit democracy
over the long run.
There are also short
term negative issues. One is
the precedent of students in
the legislature saying "we
need to get our way" to put
it uncharitably The second
is that President Ma Ying-
Jeou [president of Taiwan
and chairman of the KMT]
has a comfortable KMT ma
jority in the legislature and
was elected, and re-elected,
on a platform that included
closer economic ties with the
Mainland. And yet he still
can't get approval for his
cross-Strait policy. So I wor
ry that there may be dam
age to the legitimizing effects
of winning elections and con
trolling majorities in Taiwan.
