## Researchers clarify neural protein role Molecule integral to pruning con nections in visual system 
### SILVIANA ILCUS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A team of Stanford researchers
has discovered that a molecule previ
ously thought to exclusively play a
role in the immune system is in fact
both necessary and sufficient for
pruning connections between neu
rons in the visual system, in a break
through that opens the door to fur
ther advances in the field.
According to Hanmi Lee, a re
search associate in the lab of Profes
sor of Biology Carla Shatz and the
study's first author, babies are born
with an enormous number of connec
tions in their brains. Those connec
tions are strengthened over time as
neurons fire in sync, though the fur
ther refinement of vision requires
that some unnecessary neuronal
connections be cut back.
"You need the proper activity
pattern and proper experiences ... to
get rid of the wrong connections and
strengthen the right ones," said
Jaimie Adelson Ph.D. 'l4, who col
laborated on the study.
In previous years, Shatz's lab had
published work that found that a
group of proteins major histo
compatibility complex (MHC)
which play a major part in the im
mune system also had a role in the
development of the nervous system.
Mice genetically engineered to
lack two particular MHC proteins
(namely D and K) not only had poor
ly functional immune systems, but
also visual systems; unrelated parts
of the two eyes had formed and
strengthened connections, and the
mice were unable to tell basic shapes
apart. Until the publication of this
study, however, it was unclear
whether the immune system was re
sponsible for the nervous system's
pruning.
Adelson and Barbara Brott, a re
search assistant in the Shatz lab and
collaborator on this study, noted that
the genetic engineering necessary to
address this question could be very
challenging. Lee, however, said that
she had "found a shortcut."
A group of mice she engineered
only expressed D and K in their
brains; while their immune systems
were still heavily compromised, their
visual system worked normally. The
out-of-sync visual system neurons
had been disconnected, even if the
immune system was barely function-
