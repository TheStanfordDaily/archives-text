### – Madeleine Han 
Preparations for the construction of the
new Manzanita Park Residence Hall are now
underway.

In a statement on the project homepage,
the University noted that the dormitory
the final addition to the Manzanita Park
Community —is being built to address a
need for more undergraduate housing on
campus. The new hall, which is scheduled for
completion in the summer of 2015, is the first
to be built on campus in 20 years.
The three-floor hall will house up to 125
upper-class undergraduates in single and

two-room doubles, as well as three visiting
scholars and graduate students.
In addition to typical dorm features a
lounge, kitchenette and computer cluster
the hall will also include study spaces, semi
nar rooms and an outdoor plaza.
The University has sought to address po
tential concerns about the community impact
of construction, on-site preparations for
which began over spring break.
"Due to the nature of a construction proj
ect of this magnitude, some amount of traffic,
noise, dirt and dust impacts are unavoid
able," the project's website noted. "Every ef
fort will be made to minimize the impact of
construction activity on the surrounding
community."
