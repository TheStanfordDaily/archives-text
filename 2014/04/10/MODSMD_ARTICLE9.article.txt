## Extinguishing the fires of April Fools' Day jokes 
### Do-Hyoung Park 
Twas the 31st of March, and
we in the sports depart
ment at the offices of The
Daily were trying our hard
est to come up with fake
sports headlines that we could run in
the annual April Fools' Day edition of
the newspaper. What could we write
that would both entertain the Stanford
population and poke a little fun at the
sports headlines of the time?
We settled on three pieces: one
about Stanford supposedly relocating
to the American Athletic Conference at
the end of the season that certainly
drew the ire of AAC faithful around the
nation; one about Stanford baseball
making some absurd renovations to
Klein Field at Sunken Diamond; and
the bombshell, an article about Yan
kees third baseman Alex Rodriguez
taking a coaching position with Stan
ford baseball.

Rodriguez himself had evidently
been lurking around Stanford's cam
pus and had even been sighted at a
baseball game, prompting a retweet
ing of a photo from Stanford baseball's
TWitter account that was too good to
not to use to our advantage. I think that
the article in and of itself would have
been borderline believable without the
embedded Tweet, but the inclusion of
the Tweet without context did, admit
tedly make the article seem at least
somewhat believable after a rudimen
tary read.
But really, such out-of-the-ordinary
news involving one of baseball's most
polarizing figures couldn't have been
taken seriously right? Even the most
cursory of Google searches would have
revealed the supposed breaking news
to be nothing more than an April Fools'
Day joke.
Leave it to the Internet to prove me
wrong.

I was linked two mornings ago to a
video on AOL Spoils (and a rather well
put-together one, at that) detailing Ro
driguez's supposed decision to coach at
Stanford. It completely caught me off
guard; I'd forgotten that the story had
even been published and had not
tagged it with any of the customary
search engine optimization tools when
putting it online in order to limit its ex
posure. I was shocked that a news out
let had picked it up and taken it seri
ously because there were definitely
hints apart from being a relatively
unbelievable concept, the contact line
attributed the article to Lennay Kekua
(of Manti Te'o fame) and, of course, the
article was time-stamped April 1.
While Rodriguez's actions certainly
didn't help debunk the rumor—he
was spotted at a women's rugby prac
tice a few days ago, he was sighted
working out at Arrillaga Gym and was
also found at the Stanford Invitational
track meet this weekend —it was still
a really funny reflection on how spoils
are reported today; the fact that any
one had taken it seriously at all and had
Mowed up on it with a story of their
own was icing on the cake.
In today's spoils world, with every
body connected by the all-encompass
ing web that is the Twitter-verse, news
makes its way around fast. People
have access to news almost immedi
ately when it happens and are in
creasingly able to filter their recep
tion of news to cater to their prefer
ences, meaning that Yankees fans
are able to catch on to news involving
their favorite disgraced star relative
ly easily with a search filter even
fake news from a reasonably low-dis
tribution paper like The Daily
and write panicked/snarky/confused
updates on their fan blogs, Twitters,
Facebooks and whatever other out
lets they choose to interact on.
It's really similar to how what we
at the office fondly refer to as "War
Damn Winston" took the nation by
storm in late 2013 after the epic end
ing to the Iron Bowl. Looking at the
analytics, it turns out that somebody
had posted a link to the article on a
Scout.com forum after perhaps hav
ing searched Google for more read
ing material on the game, which
prompted it to spread to lots of other
sites within just one morning. As a
matter of fact, it even ended up on
Reddit and got a significant number
of clicks through that as well, result
ing in the story being one of the top
five most read stories in Daily web
history before 24 hours had even
elapsed.
The power of what people that
care about a topic can do on the In
ternet is scary, man.
I guess the moral of the story is
that even when we think nobody is
looking, never underestimate the
power (and gullibility) of the Inter-
