# STANFORD FOOTBALL
## SPRING STAGE SET 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
It's strange to think that the vaunted Stan
ford Cardinal defense that has been the driv
ing force behind the success of the last two
years might be the unit with the most questions
moving forward into the new season. But with
Shayne Skov and Trent Murphy the heart
and soul of the 2013 defense graduating and
Ed Reynolds leaving for the NFL Draft, there
are many more questions than answers at the
moment for the planners of the #PartylnThe-
Backfield.
Stanford fans will likely see some of those
questions answered on Saturday, when the
Cardinal and White Spring Game the prel
ude to the highly anticipated 2014-15 season
will take place at Stanford Stadium and give
people around the nation a sneak peek at how
the team is weathering the losses of some of its

most spirited leaders and performers.
While the defense emerged victorious in last
year's edition of the intrasquad scrimmage, the
offense will look to have an upper hand this sea
son as it returns a deep and experienced corps
at its skill positions from last season, with ris
ing senior quarterback Kevin Hogan returning
for his third season helming the unit.
Although the main question on offense for
the majority of this offseason was how it would
respond to the departure of Tyler Gaffney, who
carried the team with his 1,709 yards last sea
son, the successes of the stable of running
backs expected to replace him sophomore
Barry Sanders, junior Remound Wright, junior
Kelsey Young and senior Ricky Seale
