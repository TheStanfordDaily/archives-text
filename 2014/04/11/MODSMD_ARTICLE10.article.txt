# STANFORD FOOTBALL
## SPRING STAGE SET 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
It's strange to think that the vaunted Stan
ford Cardinal defense that has been the driv
ing force behind the success of the last two
years might be the unit with the most questions
moving forward into the new season. But with
Shayne Skov and Trent Murphy the heart
and soul of the 2013 defense graduating and
Ed Reynolds leaving for the NFL Draft, there
are many more questions than answers at the
moment for the planners of the #PartylnThe-
Backfield.
Stanford fans will likely see some of those
questions answered on Saturday, when the
Cardinal and White Spring Game the prel
ude to the highly anticipated 2014-15 season
will take place at Stanford Stadium and give
people around the nation a sneak peek at how
the team is weathering the losses of some of its

most spirited leaders and performers.
While the defense emerged victorious in last
year's edition of the intrasquad scrimmage, the
offense will look to have an upper hand this sea
son as it returns a deep and experienced corps
at its skill positions from last season, with ris
ing senior quarterback Kevin Hogan returning
for his third season helming the unit.
Although the main question on offense for
the majority of this offseason was how it would
respond to the departure of Tyler Gaffney, who
carried the team with his 1,709 yards last sea
son, the successes of the stable of running
backs expected to replace him sophomore
Barry Sanders, junior Remound Wright, junior
Kelsey Young and senior Ricky Seale

Senior inside linebacker A.J. Tarpley (right) will be one of the leaders of a Cardinal defense
with many questions, particularly in the secondary, heading into Saturday's Spring Game.
throughout spring practices has
largely assuaged that doubt. Al
though Wright will miss the
Spring Game due to a disciplinary
issue, Sanders, Seale and Young
will likely have numerous oppor
tunities on Saturday to make
their cases for increased playing
time next season.
Meanwhile, with Stanford re
turning essentially its entire wide
receiving corps from last season
and Hogan returning to throw to
them after already having had a
year to develop his connections
with them, the Cardinal passing
game will likely be one of the more
impressive elements of the Spring
Game. With the emergence of
freshmen Eric Cotton, Austin
Hooper and Greg Taboada as vi
able receiving options at tight end
during spring practices, the pass

ing game will only get better mov
ing forward as the trio matures.
Given that the most question
able element of the Cardinal de
fense looks to be the secondary af
ter the losses of not only Reynolds,
but also senior defensive backs
Usua Amanam and Devon Car
rington, it will be up to senior Kyle
Olugbode, along with newcomers in
sophomores Dallas Lloyd and Kodi
Whitfield, to continue solid springs
and execute in a game setting. Al
though Lloyd and Whitfield the
converts from the offense have
drawn positive reviews about their
skills and physicality from coaches
and teammates alike, they will need
to have big days to offset the miss
ing talent of sophomore cornerback
Alex Carter, who still has not re
turned from injury.

The front seven will look to be in
good shape even without Skov and
Murphy, with senior defensive end
Henry Anderson leading a defen
sive line that will be bolstered by
the addition of sophomore Aziz
Shittu as a viable candidate in the

rotation, taking the pressure off of
senior Blake Lueders and sopho
more Luke Kaumatule, who are
both still working on putting on
weight and improving their tech
nique heading into the season.
In the linebacking corps, junior
Kevin Anderson and freshman Pe
ter Kalambayi are looking to take a
much more significant role in the
rotation on the outside, while soph
omore Blake Martinez and senior
Joe Hemschoot will be among the
more experienced inside lineback
ers taking the place alongside
Tarpley up the middle.
For the second season in a row,
the game will consist of the offense
facing the defense on every drive
rather than splitting the team into
two squads that would play each
other in a mock-up of a real game.
The game will start at Stanford
Stadium at 1 p.m. on Saturday with
free admission and will be televised
on the Pac-12 Networks.

with many questions, particularly in the secondary, heading into Saturday's Spring Game.
throughout spring practices has
largely assuaged that doubt. Al
though Wright will miss the
Spring Game due to a disciplinary
issue, Sanders, Seale and Young
will likely have numerous oppor
tunities on Saturday to make
their cases for increased playing
time next season.
Meanwhile, with Stanford re
turning essentially its entire wide
receiving corps from last season
and Hogan returning to throw to
them after already having had a
year to develop his connections
with them, the Cardinal passing
game will likely be one of the more
impressive elements of the Spring
Game. With the emergence of
freshmen Eric Cotton, Austin
Hooper and Greg Taboada as vi
able receiving options at tight end
during spring practices, the pass

ing game will only get better mov
ing forward as the trio matures.
Given that the most question
able element of the Cardinal de
fense looks to be the secondary af
ter the losses of not only Reynolds,
but also senior defensive backs
Usua Amanam and Devon Car
rington, it will be up to senior Kyle
Olugbode, along with newcomers in
sophomores Dallas Lloyd and Kodi
Whitfield, to continue solid springs
and execute in a game setting. Al
though Lloyd and Whitfield the
converts from the offense have
drawn positive reviews about their
skills and physicality from coaches
and teammates alike, they will need
to have big days to offset the miss
ing talent of sophomore cornerback
Alex Carter, who still has not re
turned from injury.

The front seven will look to be in
good shape even without Skov and
Murphy, with senior defensive end
Henry Anderson leading a defen
sive line that will be bolstered by
the addition of sophomore Aziz
Shittu as a viable candidate in the

rotation, taking the pressure off of
senior Blake Lueders and sopho
more Luke Kaumatule, who are
both still working on putting on
weight and improving their tech
nique heading into the season.
In the linebacking corps, junior
Kevin Anderson and freshman Pe
ter Kalambayi are looking to take a
much more significant role in the
rotation on the outside, while soph
omore Blake Martinez and senior
Joe Hemschoot will be among the
more experienced inside lineback
ers taking the place alongside
Tarpley up the middle.
For the second season in a row,
the game will consist of the offense
facing the defense on every drive
rather than splitting the team into
two squads that would play each
other in a mock-up of a real game.
The game will start at Stanford
Stadium at 1 p.m. on Saturday with
free admission and will be televised
on the Pac-12 Networks.
