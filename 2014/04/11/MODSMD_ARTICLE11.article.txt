# CLASH OF THE TITANS
## 
### CARLIE TENENBAUM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Friday's women's water polo
match will be a true clash of the ti
tans, but different titans than
many expected during the presea
son. While many expected the No.
1 Cardinal (17-1, 3-0 MPSF) to be
fighting for the top spot in the na
tion, most expected that the other
team in the top two would be No. 3
USC and not No. 2 UCLA (21-2,3-
0). However, it is in fact the Bruins
that hold that second-place spot in
the latest rankings, presumably
making Friday's battle between
Stanford and UCLA one for the
top spot in the nation.
It will be the first time the
teams have met in a non-tourna
ment match this season; they split

the two tournament games they
have played, with Stanford win
ning the meeting at the Stanford
Invitational 8-4, and UCLA taking
the match at the UC-Irvine Invi
tational three weeks later 9-6 to
hand Stanford its only loss of the
season.
The Cardinal will enter the
matchup on an eight-match win
ning streak that was punctuated
by a decisive 14-4 victory over No.
5 Arizona State last weekend to
follow up a 9-5 dethroning of then-
No. 1 USC the weekend before
that. With Stanford nearing the
end of its season and a season
closing match against No. 4 Cal
looming, it will be important for
the Cardinal to push away the
Bruins to ensure that they will en
ter that final key matchup, and the

conference tournament after that,
on a high note.
The UCLA team is led by jun
ior Emily Donohoe, an offensive
powerhouse who has scored 46
goals this season to lead the Bru
ins. The Upland, Calif., native has
also scored four goals in a game
five different times this season.
She recorded one goal in UCLA's
win over Stanford earlier this sea
son but was shut out in its loss,
meaning that keeping Donohoe
from being a factor in the match
will be important if the Cardinal
hope to claim its second victory
this season over the Bruins.

Sophomore goalkeeper Gabby Stone (above) had 17 saves against then-No. 1 USC in a 9-5 victory two
weeks ago. She will hope to do the same when facing an inconsistent UCLA offense this weekend.
fense will be sophomore goalkeep
er Gabby Stone, who will look to
anchor a Cardinal defense coming
off of dominant back-to-back out
ings against the powerful offenses
of the Trojans and Sun Devils.
The defense has really clicked
down the stretch heading into the
end of the season and has de
creased its opponents' scoring out
put in each of Stanford's last four
matches. It also has not allowed
more than 10 goals in any match

this season, making the matchup
between the Stanford defense and
a UCLA offense that was held un
der 10 for a six-game stretch earli
er this season likely to swing in fa
vor of the Cardinal.
On the other side, UCLA's de
fense is anchored by goalkeeper Sa
mi Hill, who ranks second in the
conference with a 4.77 goals-against
average and third with 9.86 saves
per game. Despite Stanford ranking
second in goals per game in the con
ference with 13.94 and boasting five
30-goal scorers on the season, the
UCLA defense has held Stanford to
its two lowest scoring outputs of the
season, allowing just 8 goals in the
Cardinal's win and holding Stanford

to 6 in the Bruins' win.
After the monumental matchup
with the Bruins, Stanford will wrap
up its regular-season road schedule
with a Saturday match against Cal
State-Bakersfield (12-18, 0-4), in
which national-title caliber Stan
ford should have little problem dis
patching a Roadrunners squad that
has still not won a conference game
this season.
Friday's clash with the Bruins
will start at 1:30 p.m. and will be tel
evised on the Pac-12 Networks,
while the Saturday matchup against
the Roadrunners will start at 1 p.m.
