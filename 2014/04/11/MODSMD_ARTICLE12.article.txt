## Year to end at Western Rodgers seeks fourth straight win 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
As it has for the past three sea
sons, the Stanford men's golf team
will end its regular season on the
picturesque fairways of the
Pasatiempo Golf Club in Santa
Cruz, Calif. Pasatiempo, playing
host to this weekend's Western In
tercollegiate, is the Cardinal's final
stop before embarking on what
they hope is a long and successful
postseason. On the individual side,
junior Patrick Rodgers will look to
win his fourth straight tournament
as he tracks down Tiger Woods for
the most event victories in program
history.
"[Rodgers is] on top of his game
and feeling good about where he
stands," said head coach Conrad
Ray. "He's in good form, so I'm anx
ious to see how he does. He's
played well at Pasatiempo in the
past, winning the individual title
two years ago, so he's got some
vibes and knows the course well."
The Western Intercollegiate is a
bit unique in a couple of ways. In
stead of the usual play 5-count 4
format of most collegiate invitation
als, Western will employ a play 6-
count 5 model. This means that
Stanford will be able to play six
golfers each round and count the
lowest five scores towards its cu
mulative score. In addition, the 54-
hole event will be played over two
days rather than the regular three,
with the competitors scheduled to
complete 36 holes on Satur
day before playing one
frame Sunday.
Like the event played on
its historic slopes, Pasatiem
po itself is a special venue,
especially when considering
its connection to this week
end's Masters. The course
was designed by Alister
MacKenzie, the same archi
tect behind the creation of
Augusta National. MacKen
zie, whose ashes were spread
over the Pasatiempo course
shortly after his death in
1934, was famous for utiliz
ing a minimalist approach in
his design theories and liked
to disturb the natural envi
ronment as little as possible.
MacKenzie courses also de
liver large but undulating
putting surfaces, a facet of
the layout which Stanford
will certainly have to over
come in order to score well.
"We've been working dili
gently on the shots we're go
ing to face at Pasatiempo,"
Ray said. "The greens are al
ways a challenge there, so
lag putting and speed con
trol, as well as playing from
the fairway into the green
are huge assets we've been
focusing on. Keeping our ball
straight off the tee and
working on our distance con
trol on the greens."
As was the case with the
women's team at the
PING/ASU Invite, the West
ern Intercollegiate should be
an excellent opportunity for
the men's squad to see how it
compares to its Pac-12 oppo
nents, with five other confer
ence teams in the field this
weekend. The Card per

formed fairly well at this
tournament last year, plac
ing third overall and receiv
ing top-15 finishes from
Rodgers and then-junior
Cameron Wilson. This time
around, Stanford will likely
get more out of its two fron
trunners, thus placing a
huge premium on how well
its 3-6 players can perform.
"We've added [freshman]
Jim Liu as our sixth man to
the roster that played at The
Goodwin," Ray said. "So
we're hoping that Jim will be
a great addition, as it's six
count five at the Western In

tercollegiate. He's shown
some really low rounds, and
I think he's on his way to be
ing a major part of this team,
so we're anxious to stick him
in there."
The former top-ranked
U.S. junior golfer, Liu will be
one of three freshmen in the
sextet along with Maverick
McNealy and Viraat Bad
hwar. Rodgers, Wilson and
sophomore David Boote
round out Ray's relatively
young but experienced line
up, which will be seeking both
validation of their prepara
tion and momentum to use

throughout postseason play.
"The guys have been
fired up and practicing hard
this week in preparation,"
Ray said. "I think that they
know and realize that this is
the time of year where we
really need to get in our best
form as we head hopefully to
the NCAA Regionals and
NCAA Championship... we
are on the cusp of the time
that matters, and the guys
are in good spirits and excit
ed to see what happens."

ence teams in the field this
weekend. The Card per

formed fairly well at this
tournament last year, plac
ing third overall and receiv
ing top-15 finishes from
Rodgers and then-junior
Cameron Wilson. This time
around, Stanford will likely
get more out of its two fron
trunners, thus placing a
huge premium on how well
its 3-6 players can perform.
"We've added [freshman]
Jim Liu as our sixth man to
the roster that played at The
Goodwin," Ray said. "So
we're hoping that Jim will be
a great addition, as it's six
count five at the Western In

tercollegiate. He's shown
some really low rounds, and
I think he's on his way to be
ing a major part of this team,
so we're anxious to stick him
in there."
The former top-ranked
U.S. junior golfer, Liu will be
one of three freshmen in the
sextet along with Maverick
McNealy and Viraat Bad
hwar. Rodgers, Wilson and
sophomore David Boote
round out Ray's relatively
young but experienced line
up, which will be seeking both
validation of their prepara
tion and momentum to use

throughout postseason play.
"The guys have been
fired up and practicing hard
this week in preparation,"
Ray said. "I think that they
know and realize that this is
the time of year where we
really need to get in our best
form as we head hopefully to
the NCAA Regionals and
NCAA Championship... we
are on the cusp of the time
that matters, and the guys
are in good spirits and excit
ed to see what happens."

Freshman Jim Liu (above) will be the sixth person competing for Stanford at the Western
Intercollegiate, which allows for an extra competitor and an extra score to be counted.
As it has for the past three sea
sons, the Stanford men's golf team
will end its regular season on the
picturesque fairways of the
Pasatiempo Golf Club in Santa
Cruz, Calif. Pasatiempo, playing
host to this weekend's Western In
tercollegiate, is the Cardinal's final
stop before embarking on what
they hope is a long and successful
postseason. On the individual side,
junior Patrick Rodgers will look to
win his fourth straight tournament
as he tracks down Tiger Woods for
the most event victories in program
history.
"[Rodgers is] on top of his game
and feeling good about where he
stands," said head coach Conrad
Ray. "He's in good form, so I'm anx
ious to see how he does. He's
played well at Pasatiempo in the
past, winning the individual title
two years ago, so he's got some
vibes and knows the course well."
The Western Intercollegiate is a
bit unique in a couple of ways. In
stead of the usual play 5-count 4
format of most collegiate invitation
als, Western will employ a play 6-
count 5 model. This means that
Stanford will be able to play six
golfers each round and count the
lowest five scores towards its cu
mulative score. In addition, the 54-
hole event will be played over two
days rather than the regular three,
with the competitors scheduled to
complete 36 holes on Satur
day before playing one
frame Sunday.
Like the event played on
its historic slopes, Pasatiem
po itself is a special venue,
especially when considering
its connection to this week
end's Masters. The course
was designed by Alister
MacKenzie, the same archi
tect behind the creation of
Augusta National. MacKen
zie, whose ashes were spread
over the Pasatiempo course
shortly after his death in
1934, was famous for utiliz
ing a minimalist approach in
his design theories and liked
to disturb the natural envi
ronment as little as possible.
MacKenzie courses also de
liver large but undulating
putting surfaces, a facet of
the layout which Stanford
will certainly have to over
come in order to score well.
"We've been working dili
gently on the shots we're go
ing to face at Pasatiempo,"
Ray said. "The greens are al
ways a challenge there, so
lag putting and speed con
trol, as well as playing from
the fairway into the green
are huge assets we've been
focusing on. Keeping our ball
straight off the tee and
working on our distance con
trol on the greens."
As was the case with the
women's team at the
PING/ASU Invite, the West
ern Intercollegiate should be
an excellent opportunity for
the men's squad to see how it
compares to its Pac-12 oppo
nents, with five other confer
ence teams in the field this
weekend. The Card per

formed fairly well at this
tournament last year, plac
ing third overall and receiv
ing top-15 finishes from
Rodgers and then-junior
Cameron Wilson. This time
