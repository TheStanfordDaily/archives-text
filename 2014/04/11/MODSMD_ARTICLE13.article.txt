## Thinking about stress at Stanford 
### Matt Lopez 
Here's a conversation I over
heard late last quarter. It
was in an Econ class, if that
matters:
"Hey, how's it going?" asked
one.
"Oh, you know, Week 10,"
replied the other.
"Tell me about it, I'm so tired."
"Me too, I have so much work."
I stopped listening then, both
because I remembered that eaves
dropping is rude and because I al
ready knew how the conversation
would continue. These are the con
versations we begin to have after
every Week 7, when "Oh, you know,
midterms" has been used up and
"Oh, well, it's only Week 2" has fad
ed into a distant memory. These are
also the conversations that make it
difficult to stop and breathe, to take
a break, to catch up with old
friends, to be stress-free at Stan
ford.
I don't think that the exchange I
heard was particularly consequen
tial — it's likely that the partici
pants were mild acquaintances who
felt obliged to chat after accidental
ly making eye contact. But think
about how many similarly trivial
conversations we have found our
selves in, waiting for a latte at Star
bucks or in line at the post office.
They play out according to the
script penned by our collective con
sciousness, lines we can recite with
ease. Through sheer repetition, the
throwaway comments we make
about how tired we are or how
much work we have create and re
inforce a Stanford culture in which
stress is a norm.
As a result, we tend to treat
stress as a form of currency. In the
same way that one might wear a
bulky gold watch, one remarks on
how he simply has no free time any
more. Stories of extreme procrasti
nation dazzle like luxury cars
impressive, oft-discussed and total
ly unnecessary. And to not have
stress, well, it might be time to ac
cumulate some more, because the
last thing one wants to say in re
sponse to "I'm so stressed out" is
"I'm doing just fine."
Of course, I don't mean to belit
tle or ignore the very real stress
that students, myself included, reg
ularly experience. Stanford can be
extraordinarily demanding, and at
least once in our academic careers
we can all rightfully claim the feel
ing that the very ground that holds
us up is crumbling. I can't help but
feel, though, that we enable a sig
nificant amount of stress by acting
as if that stress is to be expected. In
doing so, we embed procrastina
tion, overloading on units, and stay

ing up late into the Stanford work
culture. Because the student body
perceives these behaviors as nor
mal, it is incredibly difficult to
push the culture in a healthier di
rection. The language of "Oh, you
know, Week 10," rich with assump
tions and expectations, limits us to
one point of view.
It's a fiction we build for our
selves and repeat in our heads. If I
am stressed, then I must be doing
something right. If I am stressed,
then I must deserve to be here.
Even after we have shrugged off
that freshman year angst, risen
above the sophomore slump and
left behind our exhausting teens as
a junior, we doubt it. In a world of
intangibles, we quantify stress in
order to compensate for that uncer
tainty, and in the process we com
pare and aggrandize. During Week
10, Dead Week the week in
which we die under all of the pres
sure —we die so often that it
makes us feel alive.
I've made it this far without
mentioning the elephant-sized duck
in the room, but it's bound to be on
your mind. The Stanford Duck
Syndrome, like so many other
terms that have been mythologized
and repeated so often that they
barely hold meaning, understates
the truth. Duck Syndrome is now
so ingrained in our culture that it
both draws attention to struggles
we face, academically and personal
ly, and implies that we must strug
gle. Making a diagnosis does noth
ing to cure the illness and yet we
have stopped there.
Week 2 may seem either too late
or far too early to think about how
we act in Week 10. But if it is indeed
small conversations and accepted
habits that are the building blocks
of our stress culture, then we must
be conscious of that starting now.
There is little the administration
can do to help, because this is a
problem we students made for our
selves. We, in our dorms, in our
houses and in our apartments, de
cide how we approach our work and
how we talk about our struggles.
The onus is on us to do the diffi
cult work of writing a new script to
talk about stress. This new script
should strive to give detail and nu
ance to those feelings, to conquer
them by facing them honestly and
compassionately. It should leave
space to listen, without comparison
and without jealousy. Most impor
tantly, it should allow for the possi
bility that, today, we have no stress
at all.
