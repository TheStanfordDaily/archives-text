# The
						co-op paradox
## 
### Mark Bessen 
In case you've spent most of
your Stanford career under a
rock, co-ops are student-run co
operative living spaces intended to
foster alternative communities and
self-expression. And they're large
ly pretty good at doing that. Hun
dreds of people seek refuge from
Stanford, Inc. by joining one of the
seven tie-dye-laden cooperative
houses on campus, where everyone
cooks and cleans (well, sometimes)
and makes decisions together.
Although co-ops have gotten a
lot of (perhaps somewhat justified)
heat for serving as spaces for
white, upper-class students trying
to recreate a liberated, Woodstock
esque lifestyle for a couple years
before abandoning that for a white
picket fence, they are important
hubs for students who feel margin
al or marginalized from "main
stream" Stanford culture. But, in
my experience in Synergy, the inde
pendent thinking and individual ex
pression that motivated the estab
lishment of co-ops have been in
some ways undermined by prolifer
ation of a singular "co-op identity"
that I found extremely oppressive.
Now, Synergy has a reputation.
When someone says to me, "Oh,
you live in Synergy... " it's pretty
clear what they're thinking that
I'm a radical leftist, that I'm likely
to shave half my head on a whim to
"make a statement," that I've given
up wearing shoes to be more in
touch with the earth. Before I lived
in Synergy, I would have dismissed
or at least argued those stereo
types as exceedingly obtuse, or at
best narrow-minded. Obviously, I
thought, the Synergy stereotype
was just that a stereotype. An
oversimplification, a caricature.
To my extreme disappointment,
I found that the claim was more
than that. By no means all not
even the majority but many,
many people in Synergy have
latched onto the oversimplified
identity of the hyperpolitical,
crunchy-granola radical that the
house has come to be known by.
That, in itself, is not a problem.
Finding an identity for oneself is
nothing to scoff at, and is indeed
wonderful and commendable. How
ever, when that identity comes not
from within, but from a superim
posed idea of what one's identity

should be according to a societal
projection, problems begin to arise.
People become "sheeple" and the
house begins to assume a unified
identity. But the house, made up of
over 50 individuals, should never
and in fact cannot be properly rep
resented as a singular entity, for
doing so silences the voices of mem
bers with differing opinions.
That, in a nutshell, is why I left
Synergy.
I left friends and memories and
tremendous fun and camaraderie
because I felt intellectually and po
litically oppressed under the
weight of the Synergy Identity.
Let's concretize my sentiment
with an example. Last quarter,
General Petraeus came to speak at
Stanford, sponsored by Stanford in
Government. A few members of the
house wanted to host a planning
meeting for the Stanford protest
against Petraeus, which made me a
bit uneasy. (The protest which,
as you may recall, happened de
monized Petraeus as a Darth Vader
figure and a war criminal rather
than engaging him in conversa
tion.) I didn't want the planning
meeting for such a heavily political
ly charged event to be hosted at
Synergy, a place where I was typi
cally able to sit and chat and work
and relax. Nor did I want the house
to be implicated as having a unified
political identity in the eyes of the
rest of Stanford. So, when the topic
went to consensus the process
by which every house member
votes on activities in Synergy I
brought up my issues with the
event.

Despite having received support
from over a dozen housemates
when I spoke to them individually,
only one or two were willing to vo
calize any qualms during consensus.
The rest either left the meeting or
sat silently. In my eyes, that was
mob mentality taking over. I was ac
cused of inhibiting free speech, of
making the house an unsafe and in
hospitable living environment, all
for bringing up issues I had with
hosting an event at Synergy.
Moreover, when I tried to pro
vide what I thought were logical
compromises, like arranging a
room at the Haas Center or anoth
er student center to host the plan
ning meeting, I was berated. The
personal hostility was shocking to
me. But, even more shocking, was
the fact that those who had ex
pressed similar concerns to me per
sonally felt uncomfortable dis
cussing their views at the meeting.
That's what I mean by oppressive
that under the pressure of even
a loud minority's criticism, people
in the house were driven to silence.
Obviously, my experience is just
a single example. But I don't think
it is unique. I've spoken to many
other people who have faced similar
problems in cooperative living
houses. The extreme, radical liber
al portion of some of the co-ops can
be very vocal and targeting, partic
ularly to those with different politi
cal beliefs. Much to my surprise,
the paradox exists that Synergy,
largely acclaimed for its open
mindedness and welcoming com
munity, was one of the most single
minded communities I've encoun
tered on campus. It didn't foster
communication or dialogue about
political issues for me, but made me
feel judged for expressing opinions
not aligned with those I "should
hold."
As you consider pre-assigning
to Synergy or any other co-op,
scout it out. Make sure that behind
the veil of tie-dye sheets, you can
find a place where you're free to ex
press your identity. And make sure
to hold on to it to your own iden
tity even under social and politi
cal pressures that exist in any
house, but especially in co-ops.
