# What does Kardinal Kink even do, anyway?
## 
### Lily Zheng 
I'm walking to dinner at Wilbur
Dining one night, complaining
to a friend about how many
emails I've been sending out as
Kardinal Kink president, when
someone I don't know walks up
next to us.
"Um," he says.
Lately, a lot of conversations
I've been having are starting with
that sound.
"Are you talking about... Kardi
nal ... Kink?"
The two words sound rusty on
his lips like a nun talking about
sex, or like a CS Major talking
about sleep and I resist the urge
to poke fun at his obvious hesita
tion.
"Yep! I'm president. What
about it?"
He starts to do his best goldfish
imitation with his mouth gaping.
"What do you even do, anyways?"
And that's a question that I
haven't really thought about.
Kardinal Kink is Stanford's kink
and BDSM club, and a community
space for those looking to talk about,
question and celebrate their- identi
ties and experiences with kink. As a
club we do a lot of things some
times we email members about
events in the Bay Area; sometimes
we tell the mailing list about a neat
show that's just come out; some
times we bring Pocky to our meet
ings instead of cookies or sometimes
we organize mixers. Exotic, huh?
But I do get the sense that we've
become a club that everyone's
heard about but no one knows.
It's not that much a surprise, now
that I think about it after our
brief time in the media spotlight
Winter Quarter, we've been rela
tively quiet.
I've heard stories from my

friends about Kardinal Kink being
a "nudge nudge wink wink" sort of
thing, the thing you joke about
when your friend's been talking
about handcuffs too much or acci
dentally ties himself to a lamp post.
That seems to be how we're per
ceived, at least —so now for the
big question.
The elephant in the room needs
to be addressed, and unfortunately
it's not wearing a corset and stilet
tos.
"Is Kardinal Kink a sex club?"
My first response was: no. After
thinking about it a bit more,
though, I decided that it would be
more accurate to say: NO.
Kink is a lot of things, and
sometimes kink can be sex but
just because finance majors some
times have sex doesn't mean ma
joring in finance means you get a
full lecture series every quarter on
how to do it. No, Kardinal Kink is
hardly the crazy sex dungeon peo
ple imagine it to be.
I want you to think right now
about one thing you don't like about
yourself. Maybe people your entire
life have told you, whether in whis
pers or to your face, that you
shouldn't be that way, that you
should fix yourself, that you should
cover up or remove or erase a part
of yourself because it's not okay.
It's not acceptable. And then imag
ine coming to Stanford and finding
a group of people who love that
thing about you, who sit down and
laugh with you and tell you how
much they love that same thing
about themselves. Their positivity
is relieving, and you start to relax
for the first time in a long time. The
community that you find yourself
in, the space where you can finally
feel a sense of belonging and happi

ness and all the good feelings you
could want —we all wish that we
could find something like that in
our lives.
That story is your story. And
Kai'dinal Kink's story. And the sto
ry of so many Stanford students
that naming them all would take
the rest of spring quarter. We're a
club that provides an inclusive,
friendly space for people who have
never had that before in their lives,
for people who have only even
thought about kink behind closed
doors. More than that, even: we do
our best to educate the communi
ties around us, to have more people
understand that communication is
great, that trust is amazing, that
consent is indispensable, that
kink is okay.
"Yeah, but do you do anything?
When does the kinky sex happen?
During meetings?"
Calm down, shh. Getting there.

When we sit down in our group of 10
to 20 people every week, we share
our names and preferred gender
pronouns before checking in to see
how everyone's week went. Some
times a member's had a rough time
traveling and we ask about how
they're doing; sometimes final proj
ects are on everyone's mind and we
talk about how tired we all are while
wistfully eating sugar cookies;
sometimes we talk about awesome
experiences we've had at a recent
event and loudly exclaim how jeal
ous we are of the person who had
four scenes in one night. Sometimes
we watch You Tube videos or plan
movie nights, sometimes we
arrange carpools, sometimes (and
this is a rare treat) we bring in our
friends who do education in the Bay
Area to talk to us about communica
tion, negotiation, dating in the
scene, their professional lives ...
The list goes on, but the kinky

sex most notably doesn't go on.
(We don't have vanilla sex either, if
you were wondering.) We are not a
sex club: All we do is make sure
that if people want to explore kink
in their own lives, they do it consen
sually, safely and have an awesome
time and if they want to talk
about it, there's no group more ex
cited to listen.
Kardinal Kink is just a group of
students who want to make a space
where voices don't have to be
hushed in the hopes that Stanford
campus as a whole can be that sort
of space in the future.
This club has been an awesome
experience for us. And though kink
may not be for everyone, we could
all use a bit more awesome in our
lives, don't you think?

we tell the mailing list about a neat
show that's just come out; some
times we bring Pocky to our meet
ings instead of cookies or sometimes
we organize mixers. Exotic, huh?
But I do get the sense that we've
become a club that everyone's
heard about but no one knows.
It's not that much a surprise, now
that I think about it after our
brief time in the media spotlight
Winter Quarter, we've been rela
tively quiet.
I've heard stories from my

friends about Kardinal Kink being
a "nudge nudge wink wink" sort of
thing, the thing you joke about
when your friend's been talking
about handcuffs too much or acci
dentally ties himself to a lamp post.
That seems to be how we're per
ceived, at least —so now for the
big question.
The elephant in the room needs
to be addressed, and unfortunately
it's not wearing a corset and stilet
tos.
"Is Kardinal Kink a sex club?"
My first response was: no. After
thinking about it a bit more,
though, I decided that it would be
more accurate to say: NO.
Kink is a lot of things, and
sometimes kink can be sex but
just because finance majors some
times have sex doesn't mean ma
joring in finance means you get a
full lecture series every quarter on
how to do it. No, Kardinal Kink is
hardly the crazy sex dungeon peo
ple imagine it to be.
I want you to think right now
about one thing you don't like about
yourself. Maybe people your entire
life have told you, whether in whis
pers or to your face, that you
shouldn't be that way, that you
should fix yourself, that you should
cover up or remove or erase a part
of yourself because it's not okay.
It's not acceptable. And then imag
ine coming to Stanford and finding
a group of people who love that
thing about you, who sit down and
laugh with you and tell you how
much they love that same thing
about themselves. Their positivity
is relieving, and you start to relax
for the first time in a long time. The
community that you find yourself
in, the space where you can finally
feel a sense of belonging and happi

ness and all the good feelings you
could want —we all wish that we
could find something like that in
our lives.
That story is your story. And
Kai'dinal Kink's story. And the sto
ry of so many Stanford students
that naming them all would take
the rest of spring quarter. We're a
club that provides an inclusive,
friendly space for people who have
never had that before in their lives,
for people who have only even
thought about kink behind closed
doors. More than that, even: we do
our best to educate the communi
ties around us, to have more people
understand that communication is
great, that trust is amazing, that
consent is indispensable, that
kink is okay.
"Yeah, but do you do anything?
When does the kinky sex happen?
During meetings?"
Calm down, shh. Getting there.

When we sit down in our group of 10
to 20 people every week, we share
our names and preferred gender
pronouns before checking in to see
how everyone's week went. Some
times a member's had a rough time
traveling and we ask about how
they're doing; sometimes final proj
ects are on everyone's mind and we
talk about how tired we all are while
wistfully eating sugar cookies;
sometimes we talk about awesome
experiences we've had at a recent
event and loudly exclaim how jeal
ous we are of the person who had
four scenes in one night. Sometimes
we watch You Tube videos or plan
movie nights, sometimes we
arrange carpools, sometimes (and
this is a rare treat) we bring in our
friends who do education in the Bay
Area to talk to us about communica
tion, negotiation, dating in the
scene, their professional lives ...
The list goes on, but the kinky

sex most notably doesn't go on.
(We don't have vanilla sex either, if
you were wondering.) We are not a
sex club: All we do is make sure
that if people want to explore kink
in their own lives, they do it consen
sually, safely and have an awesome
time and if they want to talk
about it, there's no group more ex
cited to listen.
Kardinal Kink is just a group of
students who want to make a space
where voices don't have to be
hushed in the hopes that Stanford
campus as a whole can be that sort
of space in the future.
This club has been an awesome
experience for us. And though kink
may not be for everyone, we could
all use a bit more awesome in our
lives, don't you think?

I'm walking to dinner at Wilbur
Dining one night, complaining
to a friend about how many
emails I've been sending out as
Kardinal Kink president, when
someone I don't know walks up
next to us.
"Um," he says.
Lately, a lot of conversations
I've been having are starting with
that sound.
"Are you talking about... Kardi
nal ... Kink?"
The two words sound rusty on
his lips like a nun talking about
sex, or like a CS Major talking
about sleep and I resist the urge
to poke fun at his obvious hesita
tion.
"Yep! I'm president. What
about it?"
He starts to do his best goldfish
imitation with his mouth gaping.
"What do you even do, anyways?"
And that's a question that I
haven't really thought about.
Kardinal Kink is Stanford's kink
and BDSM club, and a community
space for those looking to talk about,
question and celebrate their- identi
ties and experiences with kink. As a
club we do a lot of things some
times we email members about
events in the Bay Area; sometimes
we tell the mailing list about a neat
show that's just come out; some
times we bring Pocky to our meet
ings instead of cookies or sometimes
