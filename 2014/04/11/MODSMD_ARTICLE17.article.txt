# Everyone who watched 'Her' is asking the wrong question
## 
### Angad Singh 
A recent film titled "Her" told
the story of a man who falls
in love with his phone's oper
ating system, which is voiced by the
charming Scarlett Johansson. Be
cause of my avid interest in tech
nology, my friends who watched the
film all asked me the same ques
tion: "Will technology ever be so
good that we will not be able to tell
the difference between humans and
humanlike computers?" On the face
of it, this is not a bad question at all.
In fact, this is a question that com
puter scientists have been interest
ed in since the Turing Test was pro
posed in 1950.
However, I think this is not the
important question the film raises.
To me, the more interesting ques
tion is why the lead character in the
film is in love with the voice of his
operating system even though he
clearly knows that it is not a real
human. This is not a new idea. Over
a decade ago, my mentor, the late
Stanford professor Clifford Nass,
found that people were already
treating computers much like they
treat other people. In his book The
Media Equation, Nass showed
that people exhibit all kinds of hu
man behavior toward computers,
including politeness, gender biases
and even physiological responses to
changes on the screen. It is worth
pointing out that he emphasized
that the people he studied were
Stanford students, and moreover,
people who were perfectly aware
that they were dealing with a com
puter and not a real person.
Indeed, other people can be an
noying at times. The fact that we're
all unique is pretty cool, but it also
means we are bound to disagree

with any given person about some
thing. Plus, people are often unpre
dictable, illogical, cryptic and some
times plain ridiculous. On the other
hand, technology is always there
for us and ultimately does exactly
what we ask it to do. Moreover, to
day's technologists and designers
are driven to do everything they
can to make technology more like
able. Today's computers are help
ful, friendly and even care about
getting to understand our likes
and dislikes. They try their best to
give us only the things we want
and listen intently when we give
feedback. It is thus no surprise
that we sometimes prefer interact
ing with technology than with oth
er people.
The big idea is that people don't
need to be fooled into believing
that something is a real person in
order for them to relate to it. Most
children have relationships with
their stuffed toys, even though
they know deep down that the toy
is not a real person. I'm sure all of
us also know adults who ascribe
personality traits to their inani
mate possessions; after all, this
happens in all kinds of places. I
once asked a senior executive from
National Public Radio (NPR) what
he believed the core of the company
was. He replied that the one word
that he thinks describes the role of
NPR best is "companionship."
Although I was initially sur
prised that he used that word, it
made sense to me almost immedi
ately. Even as a public radio addict,
the only time I listen to NPR is
when I'm alone, be it while driving
or running. The thing I love the
most about it is being able to turn it

on whenever I'm feeling bored and
expect to be entertained every
time. I find that this combination of
convenience and companionship is
often a surprisingly good substitute
for talking to other people.
Technology may never be mis
takable for a human, but my point
is that that doesn't seem to matter.
To me, the choice between dating a
human or a machine comes down to
a simple economic decision, weigh
ing the costs and benefits of one
over the other. Theoretically, there
is a point where the cost of not hav
ing all the favorable attributes of a
human relationship would be out
weighed by all the benefits of tech
nology. This is no different than
people choosing to be in a relation
ship despite all the inconveniences
it may pose, simply because the
benefits outweigh the costs.
Relationships are much less
about receiving than about giving.
However, this is not a natural state
of mankind, since all organisms are
inherently selfish. Are all the per
sonalization and natural language
voice algorithms making us too
comfortable being selfish and
choosing what is most convenient
for us? Is there really a point in the
future where the convenience and
comfort of technology makes the
inconvenience of interacting with a
real person just not worth it? Or is
our natural desire to socialize and
find a mate always going to be
stronger than that? Are humans re
ally going to invent and adopt tech
nology that strips us of our basic
human instincts? I sure hope not.

ately. Even as a public radio addict,
the only time I listen to NPR is
when I'm alone, be it while driving
or running. The thing I love the
most about it is being able to turn it

on whenever I'm feeling bored and
expect to be entertained every
time. I find that this combination of
convenience and companionship is
often a surprisingly good substitute
for talking to other people.
Technology may never be mis
takable for a human, but my point
is that that doesn't seem to matter.
To me, the choice between dating a
human or a machine comes down to
a simple economic decision, weigh
ing the costs and benefits of one
over the other. Theoretically, there
is a point where the cost of not hav
ing all the favorable attributes of a
human relationship would be out
weighed by all the benefits of tech
nology. This is no different than
people choosing to be in a relation
ship despite all the inconveniences
it may pose, simply because the
benefits outweigh the costs.
Relationships are much less
about receiving than about giving.
However, this is not a natural state
of mankind, since all organisms are
inherently selfish. Are all the per
sonalization and natural language
voice algorithms making us too
comfortable being selfish and
choosing what is most convenient
for us? Is there really a point in the
future where the convenience and
comfort of technology makes the
inconvenience of interacting with a
real person just not worth it? Or is
our natural desire to socialize and
find a mate always going to be
stronger than that? Are humans re
ally going to invent and adopt tech
nology that strips us of our basic
human instincts? I sure hope not.

A recent film titled "Her" told
the story of a man who falls
in love with his phone's oper
ating system, which is voiced by the
charming Scarlett Johansson. Be
cause of my avid interest in tech
nology, my friends who watched the
film all asked me the same ques
tion: "Will technology ever be so
good that we will not be able to tell
the difference between humans and
humanlike computers?" On the face
of it, this is not a bad question at all.
In fact, this is a question that com
puter scientists have been interest
ed in since the Turing Test was pro
posed in 1950.
However, I think this is not the
important question the film raises.
To me, the more interesting ques
tion is why the lead character in the
film is in love with the voice of his
operating system even though he
clearly knows that it is not a real
human. This is not a new idea. Over
a decade ago, my mentor, the late
Stanford professor Clifford Nass,
found that people were already
treating computers much like they
treat other people. In his book The
Media Equation, Nass showed
that people exhibit all kinds of hu
man behavior toward computers,
including politeness, gender biases
and even physiological responses to
changes on the screen. It is worth
pointing out that he emphasized
that the people he studied were
Stanford students, and moreover,
people who were perfectly aware
that they were dealing with a com
puter and not a real person.
Indeed, other people can be an
noying at times. The fact that we're
all unique is pretty cool, but it also
means we are bound to disagree

with any given person about some
thing. Plus, people are often unpre
dictable, illogical, cryptic and some
times plain ridiculous. On the other
hand, technology is always there
for us and ultimately does exactly
what we ask it to do. Moreover, to
day's technologists and designers
are driven to do everything they
can to make technology more like
able. Today's computers are help
ful, friendly and even care about
getting to understand our likes
and dislikes. They try their best to
give us only the things we want
and listen intently when we give
feedback. It is thus no surprise
that we sometimes prefer interact
ing with technology than with oth
er people.
The big idea is that people don't
need to be fooled into believing
that something is a real person in
order for them to relate to it. Most
children have relationships with
their stuffed toys, even though
they know deep down that the toy
is not a real person. I'm sure all of
us also know adults who ascribe
personality traits to their inani
mate possessions; after all, this
happens in all kinds of places. I
once asked a senior executive from
National Public Radio (NPR) what
he believed the core of the company
was. He replied that the one word
that he thinks describes the role of
NPR best is "companionship."
Although I was initially sur
prised that he used that word, it
made sense to me almost immedi
ately. Even as a public radio addict,
the only time I listen to NPR is
when I'm alone, be it while driving
or running. The thing I love the
most about it is being able to turn it

on whenever I'm feeling bored and

time. I find that this combination of
