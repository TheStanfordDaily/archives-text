## TELEVISION 'SILICON VALLEY' PREMIERES HBO's new series hits close to home 
### MARTY SEMILLA 
Set in the not-too-distant city
of Palo Alto, Calif., the HBO
comedy "Silicon Valley,"
which premiered April 6,
follows the lives of Richard
Hendrix (Thomas Middled
itch) and his cynical band of pro
grammers as they traverse the
tech-infested waters of Silicon
Valley. Even in the mecca of apps,
software and websites, a geek is
neither safe nor understood. In
creator Mike Judge's eyes, Silicon
Valley is a cutthroat world if
you can't code or can't think of
the "next big thing," you're out.
As technology has become
more advanced and more inclu
sive to all members of society,
computer programming has
changed. It is not only about skill,
but also about the human inter
face. "Brogrammers" (a delirious
ly coined term that reflects the
more handsome programmers)
and savvy businessmen can
thrive, whereas the "traditional
geek" cannot. They lack the
charisma needed to connect and
network with other people; be
cause of this, Richard and his
friends are behind in their field,
even if their computing talents
say otherwise.
In one scene, Erlich (T.J.
Miller), who owns the "incuba
tor" where Richard works, says
he wants to make a difference like
Steve Jobs. Richard contests that
claim: "Jobs was a poser. He did
n't even write code." Although
these are blasphemous words,
Richard has a point. People re
member the Steve Jobses of the
world and not the Steve Wozni

aks; they remember the pseudo
coders rather than the coders
themselves.
Despite the show's satiriza
tion of tech culture and the tech
industry, Richard is not cynical but
hopeful. He's awkward and shy,
yet he's capable of genius. Richard

becomes a character to root for, an
underdog, even when he is not so
sure where he is going.
When Richard's "revolution
ary" algorithm for Pied Piper, his
start-up, is discovered, everyone
is in awe of it, including the "bro
grammers" that made fun of it ini

tially. Soon, everyone wants a
piece of it, including Gavin Belson
(Matt Ross), the philanthropic
CEO of Hooli (think Google), and
the anti-college investor Peter
Gregory (Christopher Evan
Welch). As a result, Richard has a
panic attack and goes to the hos
pital, where even the doctors
will pitch start-up ideas.
When Richard decides to
build a billion-dollar company in
stead of sell out, Judge sets up the
stage for what is to come, an ex
hilarating and funny look at the
tech industry from the inside.
Judge both empowers the arche
type of the "traditional geek" and
also leaves a huge lingering ques
tion. Will Richard's app succeed?
Who knows?
With the field and the "next
big thing" constantly changing,
Pied Piper could succeed, but it
could just as easily be something
as asinine as "Nip Alert," which
gives users the direct location of a
woman with erect nipples, or
"Bit Soup," chicken noodle soup
with binary numbers.
"Silicon Valley" can be slight
ly exaggerated in its message
about tech culture because of
how cynical it is. However, it also
fully captures the passion about
start-ups, even Stanford's own,
and how one idea can make "Kid
Rock the poorest person" at a par
ty. It's funny, smart and a breeze
to watch, and quite possibly,
Judge might be able to convince
us all that even in the tech sector
of society, the real geeks, the
Wozs, run the world.
