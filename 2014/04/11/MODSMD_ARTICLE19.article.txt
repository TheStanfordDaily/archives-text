# VISUAL ARTS SAS
## Stanford Art Spaces brings art to campus 
### DEWITT CHENG 
In an effort to bridge the cultural divide be
tween techies and fuzzies, Stanford Art
Spaces (SAS) regularly mounts two-month
exhibitions of contemporary art that are
primarily situated in science and engineer
ing buildings. The current show, which
runs through April 26, features abstract paint
ings by Michael Fram of Oakland and Timothy
Stroth of San Francisco, in a set of offerings
that tweaks the familiar in distinctive ways.
Fram's "decorative ornamental composi
tions" range from pure abstractions with float
ing shapes and planes some of them exe
cuted in brilliant Fauve color to warm
toned fields dotted with recognizable imagery
(starbursts, squiggles, birds, lightning bolts,
comic-style figures) that are cheerfully carni
valesque in tone. His whimsical sense of hu
mor comes across in some of his titles ("Cow

Abstraction," "Fun Color Composition,"
"Smiling Composition" and a "Bric-a-Brac" se
ries) as well as in his images.
Stroth enlivens his hard-edged geometric
abstractions with striking color combinations
that contrast warm and cool colors to create a
push-pull optical space, a kind of counter
pane/quilt landscape for the roaming eye. His
early checkerboard-format paintings took their
grid-composition inspiration from carpets. Lat
er works employ horizontal rectangles laid in
courses like bricks, each containing an inset
done in a contrasting color, suggesting framed
pictures. In some works, these flat shapes are
warped, suggesting billowing fabric; in others,
the frames spiral outward from the center of
the canvas, their undulant forms suggesting
1960s psychedelia.
SAS has been sponsored by the Center
for Integrated Systems, which is based in the
Allen Engineering building, since 1985, when

it was initiated by then-Professor of Electrical
Engineering John Linvill. Current curator
Priscilla Hexter said that she simply happened
to be "in the right place at the right time"
when she became the third SAS curator in
November 2013.
The program is unusual, offering the pro
gramming freedom of a commercial gallery
with the community-building potential of a
nonprofit and, given the yellow-windowed,
10,500-square-foot nanotech clean room
populated by bunny-suited technicians at
its core, it is not exactly the white-cube
gallery stereotype. Exhibits held in the
Allen Building, the adjacent Packard Electrical
Engineering Building and other venues
around campus are free and open to the
general public during weekday business
hours.
