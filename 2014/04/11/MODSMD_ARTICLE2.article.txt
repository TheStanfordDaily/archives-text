# Q&A YULIA MARUSHEVSKA
## UKRAINIAN ACTIVIST 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
On April 8, Yulia Marushevska, a Ukrainian ac
tivist featured in a viral video titled "I Am a Ukrain
ian" that has garnered over seven million views
since it was uploaded in February, spoke with stu
dents at Encina Hall about the ongoing unrest in
Ukraine.
Marushevska, who is currently a Ph.D. student
at Taras Shevchenko National University, also sat
down with The Daily to discuss topics ranging from
her thoughts on corruption in Ukraine to the future
of her native country and the role students will play
in shaping it.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Would you mind shar
ing your background and what it was like grow
ing up in the Ukraine before the beginnings of
Euromaidan?
Yulia Marushevska (YM):I grew up as an ordi
nary, Western child. I grew up in a post-Soviet
Union time. Now I am a student at a good Ukrain
ian university. There were no physical issues, but in
stead, more psychological issues. My grandparents
ask me "why are you there," and I answer them
"How can I not be?"
It makes me sad that in such a rich country, so
many live a poor life. I think that 30 or 40 percent of
Ukrainians live under the poverty line. If there isn't
enough money to cure children from cancer but al
ways enough money to buy new furniture from the
best Italian designers, it's really sad. The problem is
this disrespect people lived on this small amount
of money without having a dignified life.
In Kiev, we didn't feel it as much, but we read
about it and knew that all of our politicians were ly
ing. It's like somebody created another reality for
you, a false reality and pushed you to live in this false
reality. There were a lot of accidents where women
were violated in police stations. People in the gov
ernment and the police could do whatever they
want. It made me really frustrated to hear about
these accidents in Ukraine. It's about personal re
sponsibility for the whole society.
