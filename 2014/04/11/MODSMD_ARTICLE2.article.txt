# Q&A YULIA MARUSHEVSKA
## UKRAINIAN ACTIVIST 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
On April 8, Yulia Marushevska, a Ukrainian ac
tivist featured in a viral video titled "I Am a Ukrain
ian" that has garnered over seven million views
since it was uploaded in February, spoke with stu
dents at Encina Hall about the ongoing unrest in
Ukraine.
Marushevska, who is currently a Ph.D. student
at Taras Shevchenko National University, also sat
down with The Daily to discuss topics ranging from
her thoughts on corruption in Ukraine to the future
of her native country and the role students will play
in shaping it.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Would you mind shar
ing your background and what it was like grow
ing up in the Ukraine before the beginnings of
Euromaidan?
Yulia Marushevska (YM):I grew up as an ordi
nary, Western child. I grew up in a post-Soviet
Union time. Now I am a student at a good Ukrain
ian university. There were no physical issues, but in
stead, more psychological issues. My grandparents
ask me "why are you there," and I answer them
"How can I not be?"
It makes me sad that in such a rich country, so
many live a poor life. I think that 30 or 40 percent of
Ukrainians live under the poverty line. If there isn't
enough money to cure children from cancer but al
ways enough money to buy new furniture from the
best Italian designers, it's really sad. The problem is
this disrespect people lived on this small amount
of money without having a dignified life.
In Kiev, we didn't feel it as much, but we read
about it and knew that all of our politicians were ly
ing. It's like somebody created another reality for
you, a false reality and pushed you to live in this false
reality. There were a lot of accidents where women
were violated in police stations. People in the gov
ernment and the police could do whatever they
want. It made me really frustrated to hear about
these accidents in Ukraine. It's about personal re
sponsibility for the whole society.

TSD: What do you believe
would be the best, most ef
fective form of government
in the future for Ukraine?
YM: The best way is to
take the principles of democ
racy. I like how they did that
in the United States because
people really feel this rale of
freedom. On the other hand, I
don't like this democracy in
Europe where there are too
many papers. I would like to
see an American democracy
without a European bureau
cracy. Our way is the way of a
modern country that looks in
to the future.
We are like a newborn
country in one way but on the
other hand, we have a very
old history. Yes, we were op
pressed during all of our exis
tence but our people always
were holding it somehow to
gether. Today we are Ukraini
ans besides everything else.
TSD: What are some of the
ways that other countries
can contribute to Ukraine
at this time?
YM: It's recognition,
recognition at all levels. It
doesn't matter in what way. If
you are a witter, you can
write a book about Ukraine,
you can do research about
Ukrainian culture, you can
go and be an observer of the
elections, whatever. When I
am talking to politicians, I
am asking them to contribute
in this recognition on the
symbolic level, to support us
on the moral, technical and
material level. I am talking
about making an open
regime in Ukraine to foreign
students, to journalists and

to tourists. I want people to
see this spirit of living in a
new way and on another lev
el. I am asking governments
to be more open with then*
visa politics and I am asking
them to make [student] ex
change programs and en
courage their businessmen
to come to Ukraine.
Ukraine will surprise the
international community. As
one of my friends told me, "in
Ukraine, I found myself." I
think it's a very spiritual
place and it could be a great
openness for people through
out the world.

TSD: How can Stanford stu
dents be of service and what
roles have college students
and the youth in Ukraine
held thus far?
YM: I think that in a glob
al point of view, what you can
do is to go out of your small
world of everyday study.
Study is an important thing,
but in this world, bigger is
sues exist and you have to un
derstand that you have a
great opportunity to have an
education, but this education
isn't only for you. It isn't only
for building a big career. You
are a lucky one and you have

to contribute to the world in
general. I am not talking
about helping Ukraine. In the
world, there are thousands of
problems and each of us
knows exactly where he can
be useful. I think that the best
lesson would be to make your
world bigger, bigger than on
ly consumerism. You need to
destroy these smaller borders
and become a part of bigger
issues and a bigger world.
And, of course, Ukraine is
open.

down with The Daily to discuss topics ranging from
her thoughts on corruption in Ukraine to the future
of her native country and the role students will play
in shaping it.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Would you mind shar
ing your background and what it was like grow
ing up in the Ukraine before the beginnings of
Euromaidan?
Yulia Marushevska (YM):I grew up as an ordi
nary, Western child. I grew up in a post-Soviet
Union time. Now I am a student at a good Ukrain
ian university. There were no physical issues, but in
stead, more psychological issues. My grandparents
ask me "why are you there," and I answer them
"How can I not be?"
It makes me sad that in such a rich country, so
many live a poor life. I think that 30 or 40 percent of
Ukrainians live under the poverty line. If there isn't
enough money to cure children from cancer but al
ways enough money to buy new furniture from the
best Italian designers, it's really sad. The problem is
this disrespect people lived on this small amount
of money without having a dignified life.
In Kiev, we didn't feel it as much, but we read
about it and knew that all of our politicians were ly
ing. It's like somebody created another reality for
you, a false reality and pushed you to live in this false
reality. There were a lot of accidents where women
were violated in police stations. People in the gov
ernment and the police could do whatever they
want. It made me really frustrated to hear about
these accidents in Ukraine. It's about personal re
sponsibility for the whole society.

TSD: What do you believe
would be the best, most ef
fective form of government
in the future for Ukraine?
YM: The best way is to
take the principles of democ
racy. I like how they did that
in the United States because
people really feel this rale of
freedom. On the other hand, I
don't like this democracy in
Europe where there are too
many papers. I would like to
see an American democracy
without a European bureau
cracy. Our way is the way of a
modern country that looks in
to the future.
We are like a newborn
country in one way but on the
other hand, we have a very
old history. Yes, we were op
pressed during all of our exis
tence but our people always
were holding it somehow to
gether. Today we are Ukraini
ans besides everything else.
TSD: What are some of the
ways that other countries
can contribute to Ukraine
at this time?
YM: It's recognition,
recognition at all levels. It
doesn't matter in what way. If
you are a witter, you can
write a book about Ukraine,
you can do research about
Ukrainian culture, you can
go and be an observer of the
elections, whatever. When I
am talking to politicians, I
am asking them to contribute
in this recognition on the
symbolic level, to support us
on the moral, technical and
material level. I am talking
about making an open
regime in Ukraine to foreign
students, to journalists and

to tourists. I want people to
see this spirit of living in a
new way and on another lev
el. I am asking governments
to be more open with then*
visa politics and I am asking
them to make [student] ex
change programs and en
courage their businessmen
to come to Ukraine.
Ukraine will surprise the
international community. As
one of my friends told me, "in
Ukraine, I found myself." I
think it's a very spiritual
place and it could be a great
openness for people through
out the world.

TSD: How can Stanford stu
dents be of service and what
roles have college students
and the youth in Ukraine
held thus far?
YM: I think that in a glob
al point of view, what you can
do is to go out of your small
world of everyday study.
Study is an important thing,
but in this world, bigger is
sues exist and you have to un
derstand that you have a
great opportunity to have an
education, but this education
isn't only for you. It isn't only
for building a big career. You
are a lucky one and you have

to contribute to the world in
general. I am not talking
about helping Ukraine. In the
world, there are thousands of
problems and each of us
knows exactly where he can
be useful. I think that the best
lesson would be to make your
world bigger, bigger than on
ly consumerism. You need to
destroy these smaller borders
and become a part of bigger
issues and a bigger world.
And, of course, Ukraine is
open.
