## 'Game of Thrones' returns

M M ame of Thrones" is back.
M Based on the series pre
miere, this season is go
-11 tag tÂ° be as thrilling and
I tightly choreographed
\Jas doing the ballet on
the girders of a half-finished sky
scraper. Established fans of the show
and new viewers alike should not be
disappointed.
The opening to season four of the
hit series features a wide array of re
turning characters, which, considering
the show's tendency to kill off charac
ters, is helpful for reminding the audi
ence who is still alive. The ascending
Lannister family is still sniping at each
other, Tyrion Lannister (Peter Din
klage) is still snarky and imperturbable
and Sansa (Sophie Turner) still looks
like she needs more sleep. The sex and
the violence also make a quick return,
but these seem slightly less gratuitous
than in previous seasons.
There are two key differences this
season. First, Daenerys Targaryen
(Emilia Clarke) has three much larger
dragons at her side. Hopefully, these
will become more interesting as they
transform from portable pyrotechnic
props to giant intimidating fire
breathers. Second, there is a clever
character introduction: Oberyn
Martell (Pedro Pascal). Without giving
too much away, the way he is intro
duced hints at both a naughty and
righteous side to this sassy character.
After the loss of major characters
at the aptly named "Red Wedding" last
season, viewers may be wondering
"now what?" Rather than resolving a
pressing climax carried over from the
last season, this season premiere was
forced to rebuild momentum. The first
scene is an allegorical suggestion that
the once-powerful Stark family is truly
defeated, and symbols abound
throughout the episode, such as when
the "wildlings" hint at metaphorically
eating the "crows" of the Night's
Watch by sticking a human limb from
one of the border guards on a spit.
With the exception of tracing a few
sentimental favorites, the first episode
was about palace intrigue more than
anything else.
Although minor, a few flaws have
worked their way into the show.
"Game of Thrones" typically tells its
story by showing scenes oriented
around a central character. However,
the handling of the "wildling" barbar
ian invasion suggests mild confusion
over how to recount that subplot.
Moreover, the show was uneconomi
cal with its time in a few scenes.
On balance though, "Game of
Thrones" stays sharp in a highly
amusing fashion. Although it is unlike
ly that the show will ever be known for
its depth of philosophical insight, it is
a worthy way to decompress. It is a
shame that a deeper meaning is diffi
cult to grasp. If it were available,
"Game of Thrones" might pass as a
credible candidate for a modern ver
sion of Shakespeare meets Tolkien.
