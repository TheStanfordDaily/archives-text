### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's volleyball
will take to the road this
weekend to play their last two
matches of the regular season
in Southern California. The
No. 4 Cardinal (18-7, 15-7
MPSF) have already secured
a spot in the MPSF Tourna
ment, so the team knows
these will not be its last
matches of the season. How
ever, these last games will de
cide where the Cardinal will
be ranked in conference
heading into the conference
tournament; the Cardinal
are currently in third but
could move into second with
a pair of wins and one or
more Pepperdine losses.
Stanford will first face No. 6
UC-Irvine (17-9, 14-8) in a
tough Friday matchup be
fore heading down to San
Diego to play UC-San Diego
(3-22,1-21) on Saturday.
Stanford has been on an
impressive winning streak
since the beginning of
March, having won its last
nine matches in a row. How
ever, only three of those nine
matches were on the road,
with each of the last six com
ing at home during the final
homestand of the season.
Earlier in the season, the
Cardinal struggled with con
sistency and intensity while
on the road and lost all
matches that went into five
sets. Stanford will have to
bring a strong team dynamic
and aggressive offense this
weekend in order to keep its

winning streak alive.
While Stanford swept
UC-Irvine at Maples earlier
this season, Irvine is also cur
rently on a winning streak
and has won eight of its last
nine matches. The Anteaters
are currently in fifth place in
the conference and need to
win at least one match this
weekend to qualify for the
MPSF Tournament and two
to gain home-court advantage
in the quarterfinals.
UCI is coming off of a sea
son-high hitting performance

last week against UC-San
Diego in which it hit an im
pressive .561 and was led by
senior outside hitter Jeremy
Dejno, who had a match-high
20 kills. Libero Michael
Brinkley also had a strong in
dividual performance with 10
digs for the night, allowing
UCl's offense to dominate
against a shaky UCSD team.
UC-San Diego is also
coming off a season-high hit
ting night against UC-
Merced in which it hit .554 as
a team. It also had an impres-

sive serving night with a sea
son-high 11 service aces.
While it had success against
UC-Merced, UCSD has had
a terrible season and has lost
its last six meetings with the
Cardinal, including two
matches earlier this season.
Stanford is entering these
two last matches of the sea
son averaging over 13 kills
per set and a .336 attack per
centage. More impressively,
the Cardinal have limited
their opponents to a .234 av
erage throughout the season
and have held many teams to
season-low averages. Stan
ford's defense and its ability
to maintain control of points
and force opponents to make
errors has been crucial this
season, especially during its
recent winning streak.
Another advantage Stan
ford has against both UCI
and UCSD is its service
game. This season, Stanford
has served 136 aces and has
averaged 1.5 aces per set
while averaging less than 1
service error per set. The
Cardinal's offense is led by
senior outside hitters Brian
Cook and Steven Irvin, who
both average over 3 kills per
set and have recorded over
300 kills combined this sea
son.
Both Friday's match
against UC-Irvine and Sat
urday's match against UC-
San Diego to close out the
regular season will start at 7
p.m.

senior outside hitter Jeremy
Dejno, who had a match-high
20 kills. Libero Michael
Brinkley also had a strong in
dividual performance with 10
digs for the night, allowing
UCl's offense to dominate
against a shaky UCSD team.
UC-San Diego is also
coming off a season-high hit
ting night against UC-
Merced in which it hit .554 as
a team. It also had an impres-

sive serving night with a sea
son-high 11 service aces.
While it had success against
UC-Merced, UCSD has had
a terrible season and has lost
its last six meetings with the
Cardinal, including two
matches earlier this season.
Stanford is entering these
two last matches of the sea
son averaging over 13 kills
per set and a .336 attack per
centage. More impressively,
the Cardinal have limited
their opponents to a .234 av
erage throughout the season
and have held many teams to
season-low averages. Stan
ford's defense and its ability
to maintain control of points
and force opponents to make
errors has been crucial this
season, especially during its
recent winning streak.
Another advantage Stan
ford has against both UCI
and UCSD is its service
game. This season, Stanford
has served 136 aces and has
averaged 1.5 aces per set
while averaging less than 1
service error per set. The
Cardinal's offense is led by
senior outside hitters Brian
Cook and Steven Irvin, who
both average over 3 kills per
set and have recorded over
300 kills combined this sea
son.
Both Friday's match
against UC-Irvine and Sat
urday's match against UC-
San Diego to close out the
regular season will start at 7
p.m.
