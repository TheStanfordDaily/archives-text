## StartX creates new student-centric initiative 
### NITISH IS KULKARNI DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
StartX, the Stanford-affiliated startup incu
bator, will launch a new Stanford student-spe
cific program at the organization's new
Hanover Street facilities today.
The experimental initiative, titled OpenX,
will run until June 4 of this year and will seek to
extend certain aspects of StartX programming
to the general Stanford community.
Leona Teixeira, who runs StartX's opera
tions, explained that the initiative is the culmi
nation of a long period of deliberation.
"OpenX is an initiative that we have been
thinking about for a long time," she said, fram
ing the effort as an opportunity for StartX to
engage with Stanford students, alumni and fac
ulty in a new way.
"The genesis of this really is with our new
StartX headquarters, we've really designed our
space to be optimized around community, the
ability to collaborate, to have a whole bunch of
different kinds of entrepreneurs to be in one
space," she added.
Alexa Lee '95, head of public relations and
marketing at StartX, explained that StartX
wanted to find more ways to engage the alumni
community with those early-stage founders or
students.
"This gives them a chance to do activities on
their own as well as talk to Stanford students,

people who are thinking of starting a company,
people who may traditionally become
founders," Lee said. "It's away of combining
StartX founders with current students."
Andrew Scheuermann Ph.D. 'l6, head of
campus relations at StartX, elaborated on one
of the more unique features of the initiative, the
new access that members of the Stanford com
munity will have to StartX facilities and re
sources.
"The drop-in hours are another library in
another sense, where students share and do
work, and that's why we're making it another
public space," Scheuermann said. "The entre

preneurship library is a place where people can
come and hang out and do work."
Addressing the exact purpose of OpenX,
Teixeira explained that the initiative will give
the general public something akin to a limited
office preview, where they will get exposure to
elements of StartX's accelerator program.
"What we will be doing is host a series of
workshops for Stanford students, digest the in
formation we've got from 11 cohorts of StartX
and synthesize that information into a di
gestible form for the Stanford community,"

As StartX moves to its new facilities on Hanover Street, the startup incubator
established an experimental initiative, OpenX, which hopes to engage non-technical students.
Teixeira said.
This, according to Teix
eira, should also allow stu
dents who would not tradi
tionally be involved with en
trepreneurship and StartX
to get engaged, one of the
main goals of OpenX.
"We are also working
hard in engaging what we
call 'non-networked' stu
dents," Teixeira said. "There
are a lot of students, for ex
ample, in the sciences and
the humanities, who are do
ing really innovative things
but don't think of them
selves as entrepreneurs."
"We have an ongoing ef
fort to reach out to the
movers and shakers in those
areas," Lee said, explaining
that StartX aimed to draw
even more people out of the

woodwork to think of entre
preneurship as an end goal.
Lee anticipated large
numbers of students to be
heavily involved with the
new program.
"At our event on Friday,
for example, we have [signed
up] at least 400 students
coming," Lee said. "I think
that a lot of people that are
coming to the party will have
applied to StartX we have
a record-breaking number
of applications, that's up
from last year."
She emphasized that the
program may itself be just a
precursor of broader efforts.
"We don't consider to this
to be our grand unveiling or
anything," Lee said. "People
who come to the event will
have limited access since we
are still working on the
space. We're still getting
there."

ample, in the sciences and
the humanities, who are do
ing really innovative things
but don't think of them
selves as entrepreneurs."
"We have an ongoing ef
fort to reach out to the
movers and shakers in those
areas," Lee said, explaining
that StartX aimed to draw
even more people out of the

woodwork to think of entre
preneurship as an end goal.
Lee anticipated large
numbers of students to be
heavily involved with the
new program.
"At our event on Friday,
for example, we have [signed
up] at least 400 students
coming," Lee said. "I think
that a lot of people that are
coming to the party will have
applied to StartX we have
a record-breaking number
of applications, that's up
from last year."
She emphasized that the
program may itself be just a
precursor of broader efforts.
"We don't consider to this
to be our grand unveiling or
anything," Lee said. "People
who come to the event will
have limited access since we
are still working on the
space. We're still getting
there."
