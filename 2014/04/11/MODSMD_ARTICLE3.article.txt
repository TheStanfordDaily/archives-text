## StartX creates new student-centric initiative 
### NITISH IS KULKARNI DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
StartX, the Stanford-affiliated startup incu
bator, will launch a new Stanford student-spe
cific program at the organization's new
Hanover Street facilities today.
The experimental initiative, titled OpenX,
will run until June 4 of this year and will seek to
extend certain aspects of StartX programming
to the general Stanford community.
Leona Teixeira, who runs StartX's opera
tions, explained that the initiative is the culmi
nation of a long period of deliberation.
"OpenX is an initiative that we have been
thinking about for a long time," she said, fram
ing the effort as an opportunity for StartX to
engage with Stanford students, alumni and fac
ulty in a new way.
"The genesis of this really is with our new
StartX headquarters, we've really designed our
space to be optimized around community, the
ability to collaborate, to have a whole bunch of
different kinds of entrepreneurs to be in one
space," she added.
Alexa Lee '95, head of public relations and
marketing at StartX, explained that StartX
wanted to find more ways to engage the alumni
community with those early-stage founders or
students.
"This gives them a chance to do activities on
their own as well as talk to Stanford students,

people who are thinking of starting a company,
people who may traditionally become
founders," Lee said. "It's away of combining
StartX founders with current students."
Andrew Scheuermann Ph.D. 'l6, head of
campus relations at StartX, elaborated on one
of the more unique features of the initiative, the
new access that members of the Stanford com
munity will have to StartX facilities and re
sources.
"The drop-in hours are another library in
another sense, where students share and do
work, and that's why we're making it another
public space," Scheuermann said. "The entre

preneurship library is a place where people can
come and hang out and do work."
Addressing the exact purpose of OpenX,
Teixeira explained that the initiative will give
the general public something akin to a limited
office preview, where they will get exposure to
elements of StartX's accelerator program.
"What we will be doing is host a series of
workshops for Stanford students, digest the in
formation we've got from 11 cohorts of StartX
and synthesize that information into a di
gestible form for the Stanford community,"

As StartX moves to its new facilities on Hanover Street, the startup incubator
established an experimental initiative, OpenX, which hopes to engage non-technical students.
