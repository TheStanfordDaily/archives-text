# Hack culture at Stanford develops
## Students partake in the Big Hack, LA Hacks 
### KYLIE JUE DESK EDITOR 
Three hundred students gathered in
the basement of Stanford's Jen-Hsun
Huang Engineering Center on Saturday
for the Big Hack, the annual hackathon
that pits Stanford against UC-Berkeley.
The Big Hack was organized by three
Stanford groups BASES's Hackspace,
the Stanford Association for Computer
Machinery (ACM) and Hack Stanford
in addition to Berkeley's hacking club.
This was the event's third year, and, ac
cording to ACM president Karthik
Viswanathan 'l5, the number of partici
pants has increased by about 100 students
each year.
Last year, Stanford students made up
15 percent of the approximately 200 partic
ipants. Although only 80 of the hackers
this year were Stanford students, both or
ganizers and participants framed the rela
tive gain as reflective of an ascendant
hacking culture at the University.
Although Berkeley's significantly larg
er population partly accounts for the dif
ference in registration between the two
schools, Viswanathan also spoke about a
difference in culture.
"I think Berkeley has a bigger hacking
culture than Stanford does," Viswanathan
said. "There's a strong entrepreneurial
culture here, but that's different from
hacking."
Viswanathan explained that entrepre
neurship often focuses on the profits a
product will make, while hacking is build
ing a product or application for the sake of

enjoyment. ACM aims to promote a
greater hacking culture on campus
through events like the Big Hack.
As both an organizer and participant in
the Big Hack, Jason Teplitz 'l7 admitted
that he was surprised by the lack of hack
ers at Stanford but said that he expects to
see the culture grow in the near future.
"[Stanford's hacking] is up and com
ing," Teplitz said. "It was shocking to not
see a big culture here, but I would be sur
prised if that doesn't change."
Teplitz explained that a hackathon can
act as a good launch point for a project but
that many people are intimidated by the

idea of starting from scratch.
"If you force yourself to sit down and do
something, you learn so much about the
process, but I think that process scares
people," Teplitz said. "There are so many
people that are good at CS, but when they
don't have an assignment and they can do
whatever they want, they don't know
where to start."
As a regular participant in hackathons,
Teplitz still finds new ways to experiment
at each event.
"You just brainstorm anything you

think would be awesome," Teplitz
said. "[lt] doesn't have to be some
crazy hardware could be a sim
ple web app. It's just away to learn
something new."
Participant and ACM officer
Sydney Li 'l7 noted that the Big
Hack was only her second
hackathon. She used the 24-hour
period to create a Facebook appli
cation that graphs a user's mood
based on his or her past statuses.
"You'll never be able to imple
ment what you learn in class aside
from things in assignments," Li
said. "Most things in the industry
[you learn] by working for them or
by experimenting on your own."
Kevin Hsu 'l5, a Hack Space of
ficer who helped organize the
event, also emphasized the impor
tance of hackathons in helping
coders experience the real applica
tions of programming.
"It's always exciting to see
what people make," Hsu said. "A
lot of people come to college want
ing to make something... but they
don't have time to pursue their
own personal projects. During the
hackathon, students can do what
they want to do."
At the end of the allotted time,
37 Berkeley teams and 11 Stanford
teams presented their projects to a
panel of judges. Teams were evalu
ated based on their products' user
interface, functionality and useful
ness. Prizes included Pebble
watches, Oculus Rifts and Mac-
Book Airs. Although Berkeley
teams took first and third, a Stan
ford team called Venture won sec
ond.

Venture, created by Amy Bear
man 'l6, Alanna Tempest 'l6,
Keenon Werling 'l6 and Jan Dlabal

'l6, is an app that generates differ
ent types of nearby activities
based on a user's preferences. The
team attributed much of their suc
cess to brainstorming the project
in advance of the hackathon.
"A good idea is something that
you would actually want to use,"
Bearman said. "Having built Ven
ture, we've actually used it to fig
ure out restaurants that we would
want to go to. It's something that
we felt that we had a need for so
we were motivated to create it."
For Bearman and Tempest, the
Big Hack was their second
hackathon while Werling and Dla
bal had participated in past compe
titions as well. Werling said that in
the future, they hope to create a
Stanford hacking club to bring to
gether hackers on campus.
"It would be nice to have a
hackathon club where what we do
is say we're treating this like a
sports team," Werling said. "There
will be tryouts if you are good,
you're in. If you're not, you're on
junior varsity."
They also noted that the club
would compile resources that pro
grammers could use in order to re
duce the amount of time wasted on
setup at hackathons.
"You need to do other projects
in order to get a sense of what you
enjoy and what you're good at if
you really practice for
hackathons," Tempest said. "[lt]
would be fun to set up a software
stack for hackathons easy tools
that everyone knows how to use."
Teplitz, Li and the four mem
bers of Venture are among the 180
Stanford students who will attend
the LA Hacks hackathon this
weekend. According to organizer
Shrav Mehta, the event will host a
total of around 1500 participants
from several different colleges.

pants has increased by about 100 students
each year.
Last year, Stanford students made up
15 percent of the approximately 200 partic
ipants. Although only 80 of the hackers
this year were Stanford students, both or
ganizers and participants framed the rela
tive gain as reflective of an ascendant
hacking culture at the University.
Although Berkeley's significantly larg
er population partly accounts for the dif
ference in registration between the two
schools, Viswanathan also spoke about a
difference in culture.
"I think Berkeley has a bigger hacking
culture than Stanford does," Viswanathan
said. "There's a strong entrepreneurial
culture here, but that's different from
hacking."
Viswanathan explained that entrepre
neurship often focuses on the profits a
product will make, while hacking is build
ing a product or application for the sake of

enjoyment. ACM aims to promote a
greater hacking culture on campus
through events like the Big Hack.
As both an organizer and participant in
the Big Hack, Jason Teplitz 'l7 admitted
that he was surprised by the lack of hack
ers at Stanford but said that he expects to
see the culture grow in the near future.
"[Stanford's hacking] is up and com
ing," Teplitz said. "It was shocking to not
see a big culture here, but I would be sur
prised if that doesn't change."
Teplitz explained that a hackathon can
act as a good launch point for a project but
that many people are intimidated by the

idea of starting from scratch.
"If you force yourself to sit down and do
something, you learn so much about the
process, but I think that process scares
people," Teplitz said. "There are so many
people that are good at CS, but when they
don't have an assignment and they can do
whatever they want, they don't know
where to start."
As a regular participant in hackathons,
Teplitz still finds new ways to experiment
at each event.
"You just brainstorm anything you

think would be awesome," Teplitz
said. "[lt] doesn't have to be some
crazy hardware could be a sim
ple web app. It's just away to learn
something new."
Participant and ACM officer
Sydney Li 'l7 noted that the Big
Hack was only her second
hackathon. She used the 24-hour
period to create a Facebook appli
cation that graphs a user's mood
based on his or her past statuses.
"You'll never be able to imple
ment what you learn in class aside
from things in assignments," Li
said. "Most things in the industry
[you learn] by working for them or
by experimenting on your own."
Kevin Hsu 'l5, a Hack Space of
ficer who helped organize the
event, also emphasized the impor
tance of hackathons in helping
coders experience the real applica
tions of programming.
"It's always exciting to see
what people make," Hsu said. "A
lot of people come to college want
ing to make something... but they
don't have time to pursue their
own personal projects. During the
hackathon, students can do what
they want to do."
At the end of the allotted time,
37 Berkeley teams and 11 Stanford
teams presented their projects to a
panel of judges. Teams were evalu
ated based on their products' user
interface, functionality and useful
ness. Prizes included Pebble
watches, Oculus Rifts and Mac-
Book Airs. Although Berkeley
teams took first and third, a Stan
ford team called Venture won sec
ond.

Venture, created by Amy Bear
man 'l6, Alanna Tempest 'l6,
Keenon Werling 'l6 and Jan Dlabal

'l6, is an app that generates differ
ent types of nearby activities
based on a user's preferences. The
team attributed much of their suc
cess to brainstorming the project
in advance of the hackathon.
"A good idea is something that
you would actually want to use,"
Bearman said. "Having built Ven
ture, we've actually used it to fig
ure out restaurants that we would
want to go to. It's something that
we felt that we had a need for so
we were motivated to create it."
For Bearman and Tempest, the
Big Hack was their second
hackathon while Werling and Dla
bal had participated in past compe
titions as well. Werling said that in
the future, they hope to create a
Stanford hacking club to bring to
gether hackers on campus.
"It would be nice to have a
hackathon club where what we do
is say we're treating this like a
sports team," Werling said. "There
will be tryouts if you are good,
you're in. If you're not, you're on
junior varsity."
They also noted that the club
would compile resources that pro
grammers could use in order to re
duce the amount of time wasted on
setup at hackathons.
"You need to do other projects
in order to get a sense of what you
enjoy and what you're good at if
you really practice for
hackathons," Tempest said. "[lt]
would be fun to set up a software
stack for hackathons easy tools
that everyone knows how to use."
Teplitz, Li and the four mem
bers of Venture are among the 180
Stanford students who will attend
the LA Hacks hackathon this
weekend. According to organizer
Shrav Mehta, the event will host a
total of around 1500 participants
from several different colleges.
