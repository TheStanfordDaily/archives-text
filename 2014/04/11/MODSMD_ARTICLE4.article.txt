# Hack culture at Stanford develops
## Students partake in the Big Hack, LA Hacks 
### KYLIE JUE DESK EDITOR 
Three hundred students gathered in
the basement of Stanford's Jen-Hsun
Huang Engineering Center on Saturday
for the Big Hack, the annual hackathon
that pits Stanford against UC-Berkeley.
The Big Hack was organized by three
Stanford groups BASES's Hackspace,
the Stanford Association for Computer
Machinery (ACM) and Hack Stanford
in addition to Berkeley's hacking club.
This was the event's third year, and, ac
cording to ACM president Karthik
Viswanathan 'l5, the number of partici
pants has increased by about 100 students
each year.
Last year, Stanford students made up
15 percent of the approximately 200 partic
ipants. Although only 80 of the hackers
this year were Stanford students, both or
ganizers and participants framed the rela
tive gain as reflective of an ascendant
hacking culture at the University.
Although Berkeley's significantly larg
er population partly accounts for the dif
ference in registration between the two
schools, Viswanathan also spoke about a
difference in culture.
"I think Berkeley has a bigger hacking
culture than Stanford does," Viswanathan
said. "There's a strong entrepreneurial
culture here, but that's different from
hacking."
Viswanathan explained that entrepre
neurship often focuses on the profits a
product will make, while hacking is build
ing a product or application for the sake of

enjoyment. ACM aims to promote a
greater hacking culture on campus
through events like the Big Hack.
As both an organizer and participant in
the Big Hack, Jason Teplitz 'l7 admitted
that he was surprised by the lack of hack
ers at Stanford but said that he expects to
see the culture grow in the near future.
"[Stanford's hacking] is up and com
ing," Teplitz said. "It was shocking to not
see a big culture here, but I would be sur
prised if that doesn't change."
Teplitz explained that a hackathon can
act as a good launch point for a project but
that many people are intimidated by the

idea of starting from scratch.
"If you force yourself to sit down and do
something, you learn so much about the
process, but I think that process scares
people," Teplitz said. "There are so many
people that are good at CS, but when they
don't have an assignment and they can do
whatever they want, they don't know
where to start."
As a regular participant in hackathons,
Teplitz still finds new ways to experiment
at each event.
"You just brainstorm anything you
