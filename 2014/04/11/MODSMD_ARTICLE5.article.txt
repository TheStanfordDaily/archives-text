### VIHAN LAKSHMAN DESK EDITOR 
On Wednesday, the Stan
ford Graduate School of Busi
ness (GSB) hosted its inaugu
ral Sports Innovation Confer
ence at the Knight Manage
ment Center, featuring a host
of speakers at the forefront of
the sports industry many of
them carrying Stanford diplo
mas.

"The idea [for the confer
ence] came from a group of stu
dents that wanted to engage
with all of our illustrious alum

ni in the sports space," said
Mitch Houff MBA 'l4, one of
the co-chairs of the conference.
"Once we started planning the
event, we were pleasantly sur
prised with the enthusiasm
with which our alumni and the
Stanford community embraced
the Sports Innovation Confer
ence."
Over 20 Stanford alumni
served as speakers or modera
tors during the event, including
Philadelphia 76ers General
Manager Sam Hinkie MBA 'O5,
Golden State Warriors owner
Joe Lacob MBA 'B3, San Fran

cisco 49ers Team President
Paraag Marathe MBA 'O4 and
ESPN senior writer Ivan
Maisel 'Bl.
Aside from creating a plat
form to bring Stanford's prolif
ic alumni in the sports industry
together, Houff and his co-or
ganizers Sachin Gupta
MBA 'l4, Tyler Price MBA 'l4,
Colin Twomey MBA 'l4 and
Andrew Yaffe MBA 'l4 also
envisioned the conference as
an educational medium for stu
dents interested in the sports
industry as well as a showcase
of innovations in the field

amidst the backdrop of Silicon
Valley.
"I think what's on the fron
tier is getting hold of all the
technological capabilities in Sil
icon Valley and applying them
to the sports industry" Houff
said. "There's so much talent
and so many insights here in
Silicon Valley that are directly
applicable to the fan experi
ence in sports."
In the spirit of celebrating
Silicon Valley innovation, the
conference opened with a
keynote address from Sacra
mento Kings owner and soft
ware entrepreneur Vivek
Ranadive in CEMEX Audi
torium. Ranadive's talk fo
cused primarily on the po
tential for basketball to be
come a global sport. After
Ranadive's opening re
marks, the conference atten
dees consisting mostly of
Stanford GSB students,
Stanford undergraduates
and local industry affiliates
separated into four
breakout panels: "The Fu
ture of College Sports," "A
Fireside Chat on Sports
Content," "Innovations in
Fan-Facing Technology" and
"Managing an Athlete's
Brand in the 21st Century."
After the morning break
out panels, the conference
returned to CEMEX Audi
torium for the three featured
presentations of the day
from Cisco's Mark Craig,
McKinsey & Company's Dan
Singer and Jim Thompson
MBA 'B6 of the Positive
Coaching Alliance, a non
profit organization focusing
on youth sports.
The conference resumed
in the afternoon with another
session of breakout panels:
"The Future of Televised
Sports," "The Intersection of
Brands and Sports Proper
ties," "Sports Technology and
Venture Capital" and "Bas
ketball Analytics," which fea
tured Hinkie and Golden
State Warriors forward An
dre Iguodala among others.
After the panel, Iguodala
attributed his interest in at
tending the conference to his
goal of working in venture
capital after his basketball
career.
"I'm just trying to get as

much information as I can
about the tech world," Iguo
dala said. "[Venture capital]
is kind of like being a GM
trying to put the best team
together to help the company
grow."

At 2:30 p.m., the confer
ence concluded with a
keynote panel of several ti
tans of sports business:
Marathe, Lacob, Sacramento
Kings President Chris
Granger, former San Jose
Sharks owner Kevin Comp

ton and prominent sports at
torney Jon Oram '96. Former
Oakland Raiders executive
and current CBS football an

alyst Amy Trask moderated
the panel. The group ended
the day with an outlook on
the future of professional

sports and the role of tech
nology with Lacob and
Granger trading friendly
barbs over the construction
of each other's new arena.
Ultimately, the immediate
reviews of the conference
were overwhelmingly posi
tive and, as Houff asserted,
provide a good indication
that the conference can be
come a regular fixture at the
GSB.
"Based on the number of
impressive panelists you see

and the number of attendees
here, there does seem to be a
great demand for an event
like this and what better
place to have it than in the
heart of Silicon Valley at the
Knight Management Center
here at Stanford GSB,"
Houff said. "We do think
there is a bright future for
an event like this at Stan
ford."

On Wednesday, the Graduate School of Business held an all-day conference focused on entrepeneurship and innovation in the sports industry. The
event featured a keynote panel of well-known sports businessmen, like Kevin Compton and Jon Oram '96, and several smaller panels.
On Wednesday, the Stan
ford Graduate School of Busi
ness (GSB) hosted its inaugu
ral Sports Innovation Confer
ence at the Knight Manage
ment Center, featuring a host
of speakers at the forefront of
the sports industry many of
them carrying Stanford diplo
mas.

"The idea [for the confer
ence] came from a group of stu
dents that wanted to engage
with all of our illustrious alum

ni in the sports space," said
Mitch Houff MBA 'l4, one of
the co-chairs of the conference.
"Once we started planning the
event, we were pleasantly sur
prised with the enthusiasm
with which our alumni and the
Stanford community embraced
the Sports Innovation Confer
ence."
Over 20 Stanford alumni
served as speakers or modera
tors during the event, including
Philadelphia 76ers General
Manager Sam Hinkie MBA 'O5,
Golden State Warriors owner
Joe Lacob MBA 'B3, San Fran

cisco 49ers Team President
Paraag Marathe MBA 'O4 and
ESPN senior writer Ivan
Maisel 'Bl.
Aside from creating a plat
form to bring Stanford's prolif
ic alumni in the sports industry
together, Houff and his co-or
ganizers Sachin Gupta
MBA 'l4, Tyler Price MBA 'l4,
Colin Twomey MBA 'l4 and
Andrew Yaffe MBA 'l4 also
envisioned the conference as
an educational medium for stu
dents interested in the sports
industry as well as a showcase
of innovations in the field

amidst the backdrop of Silicon
Valley.
"I think what's on the fron
tier is getting hold of all the
technological capabilities in Sil
icon Valley and applying them
to the sports industry" Houff
said. "There's so much talent
and so many insights here in
Silicon Valley that are directly
applicable to the fan experi
ence in sports."
In the spirit of celebrating
Silicon Valley innovation, the
conference opened with a
keynote address from Sacra
mento Kings owner and soft
ware entrepreneur Vivek
Ranadive in CEMEX Audi
torium. Ranadive's talk fo
cused primarily on the po
tential for basketball to be
come a global sport. After
Ranadive's opening re
marks, the conference atten
dees consisting mostly of
Stanford GSB students,
Stanford undergraduates
and local industry affiliates
separated into four
breakout panels: "The Fu
ture of College Sports," "A
Fireside Chat on Sports
Content," "Innovations in
Fan-Facing Technology" and
"Managing an Athlete's
Brand in the 21st Century."
After the morning break
out panels, the conference
returned to CEMEX Audi
torium for the three featured
presentations of the day
from Cisco's Mark Craig,
McKinsey & Company's Dan
Singer and Jim Thompson
MBA 'B6 of the Positive
Coaching Alliance, a non
profit organization focusing
on youth sports.
The conference resumed
in the afternoon with another
session of breakout panels:
"The Future of Televised
Sports," "The Intersection of
Brands and Sports Proper
ties," "Sports Technology and
Venture Capital" and "Bas
ketball Analytics," which fea
tured Hinkie and Golden
State Warriors forward An
dre Iguodala among others.
After the panel, Iguodala
attributed his interest in at
tending the conference to his
goal of working in venture
capital after his basketball
career.
"I'm just trying to get as

much information as I can
about the tech world," Iguo
dala said. "[Venture capital]
is kind of like being a GM
trying to put the best team
together to help the company
grow."

At 2:30 p.m., the confer
ence concluded with a
keynote panel of several ti
tans of sports business:
Marathe, Lacob, Sacramento
Kings President Chris
Granger, former San Jose
Sharks owner Kevin Comp

ton and prominent sports at
torney Jon Oram '96. Former
Oakland Raiders executive
and current CBS football an

alyst Amy Trask moderated
the panel. The group ended
the day with an outlook on
the future of professional

sports and the role of tech
nology with Lacob and
Granger trading friendly
barbs over the construction
of each other's new arena.
Ultimately, the immediate
reviews of the conference
were overwhelmingly posi
tive and, as Houff asserted,
provide a good indication
that the conference can be
come a regular fixture at the
GSB.
"Based on the number of
impressive panelists you see

and the number of attendees
here, there does seem to be a
great demand for an event
like this and what better
place to have it than in the
heart of Silicon Valley at the
Knight Management Center
here at Stanford GSB,"
Houff said. "We do think
there is a bright future for
an event like this at Stan
ford."
