### CHRISTINA LEE GIBBS 
A Stanford freshman has organ
ized the University's inaugural
Walk Now for Autism Speaks
walkathon, an event that will take
place at the Dish on May 4.
Spencer Savitz 'l7, who has or
ganized similar events since 2008
and raised $850,000 in the process,
partnered with the Kids with
Dreams Club to plan the
walkathon. Walk Now for Autism
Speaks began as a national
fundraising and awareness effort in
2006, with a focus on building a
community for those with autism,
promoting awareness of the disor
der and fundraising for autism re
search.
Ideas and origins
Savitz's interest in autism began
primarily through his connection
with his brother, who was diag
nosed with autism at age two. Dur-
ing sixth grade, Savitz
delved into the subject for a
major class research project,
in the process realizing his
misconceptions about the
disorder's prevalence.
"This research project al
lowed me to see how com
mon this [autism] was. By
the time I finished the re
search project it was one in
150 children," Savitz said.
This year, the U.S. Cen
ters for Disease Control and
Prevention reported that
autism affects one in 68
American children.

Currently, there is no
identified cause of autism,
but researchers have con
nected autism to genetic and
environmental factors. At
the moment, the Stanford
Autism Center is focused on

narrowing the list of genes
and environmental triggers
that cause autism.
Savitz said that he had
been surprised by how little
attention and research
autism received.
"I wanted to be able to
help my brother and those
affected by autism around
the world that were facing
day to day issues that we
were," Savitz said.
Program goals
Savitz maintained that a
number of misconceptions
persist with regards to
autism. He claimed that
most Americans are familiar
with the term autism to a
complex group of brain dis
orders identified with vary
ing levels of severity through
the presence of difficulties in
social interaction, limited
verbal and nonverbal com
munication and repetitive
behaviors but cannot dis
cuss much more than that.

"My brother, Tyler, falls
under the mild spectrum,"
Savitz said. "He loves classi
cal music has thousands
of classical music CDs. He
knows every single track
and every single composer in
order. [He] has perfect pitch,
but has a tough time doing
normal things. He needs an
aid at all times in school. He
needs to get a lot of curricu
lum modified. [He] wants to
be a conductor that's his
dream job."
Savitz, however, noted
there is some controversy
surrounding the diagnosis of
autism.
"It's very possible that
there are many types of
autism that we haven't dis
covered," Savitz said. "Just
like cancer, there are many
types of cancers. Different
types of autism just haven't
been grouped yet. And [we]
probably won't be able to
group those yet until we find
a cause for autism."

Savitz also noted the dis
tinction between using the
word "autistic" to describe a
child versus "a child with
autism," arguing that the
former description defines a
child rather than framing
the disorder as simply an
other characteristic.
"My brother is musically
talented and he loves to
laugh and smile," Savitz said.
"He's funny and a really car
ing kid."
To help spread awareness
of autism issues, Savitz said
that he hopes to later found
an Autism Speaks U organi
zation on campus that would
bring guest speakers such as
scientists and therapists to
spread awareness about the
disorder and provide a dis
cussion space for those af
fected with autism.
