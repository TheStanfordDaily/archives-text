## Addressing an unjust, broken NCAA system 
### Cameron Miller 
As I was watching what
turned out to be a
thrilling national title
matchup between
UConn and Kentucky
a few nights ago, there was one thing
in particular that stood out to me.
And no, it wasn't James Young's
Jerry World-shattering dunk, nor was
it Shabazz Napier's step-back dag
gers.
Coach Kevin Ollie's composure
was impressive, but that's still not it.
Was it the barely above-average an
nouncing from Nantz, Kerr and An
thony on CBS? Nope. But you're get
ting warmer.
What stuck out to me the most
as it had for the entire NCAA Tour
nament —was the electronic banner
that ran along the scorers' bench
reading "Celebrating student-ath
letes." The message furnished by the
NCAA and its corporate partners
was front and center and just em
phasized to me that no matter how
many logical arguments to replace
the current system are thrown their
way or how many lawsuits pile up on
their attorneys' desks, Mark Em
mert and company will doggedly
hold on to the existing student-ath
lete model until someone pries it
from their hands.

And who would blame them? As
constituted, the NCAAs business
model allows its administrators to
rake in millions of dollars in annual
compensation while the athletes get
nothing. Zero. Zilch. Nada. To pre
empt the obvious counterargument: a
scholarship is not compensation; it is
an employment contract. Free cloth
ing and footwear are nothing but
brand exposure. The admissions
process amounts to little more than a
background check. Collegiate ath
letes are not just students; they are
employees working for their universi
ties — ultimately lining the pockets
of overseers like Emmert. To argue
anything to the contrary is to have an
agenda.
But finally, at long last, the un
fairness and inherent contradictions
of the NCAAs "student-athlete" sys
tem may slowly be starting to
change.
In a landmark decision last
month, Region 13 of the National La
bor Relations Board paved the way
for football players at Northwestern
University to unionize. This case
comes in the wake of mounting exter
nal pressure on the NCAA to recon
sider the amateur status of its ath
letes, including the impending Ed
O'Bannon lawsuit and Jeffrey
Kessler's recently filed anti-trust liti
gation. All of these legal proceedings
have cast an ever-darkening shadow
on the NCAA, which has increasing
ly come under fire for what I feel are
utterly unjust rules preventing ath
letes from profiting of off their per
formance and likenesses.
Despite the withering criticism,
Emmert and his cronies have stood
firm. In a press conference preceding
the men's Final Four, the NCAAs
boss remarked that the unionization
of collegiate athletes would be a
"grossly inappropriate" method to
amending the existing system.
I'll tell you what's grossly inap
propriate: putting young men on a
stage in the middle of a billion-dollar
playpen with millions of eyes watch
ing their every move and then dis
possessing them of the exorbitant
profits their blood, sweat and tears
bought.
It's grossly inappropriate when
Napier claims that there are "hun
gry nights that I go to bed starving."
It's grossly inappropriate when
athletes put so much time 40,50,
60 hours a week in some cases
into their job of competing for their
university that it's simply impossi
ble to have another job that covers
the expenses a scholarship doesn't.
It's grossly inappropriate when
this writer can't be an extra in a
movie about running because such
participation would endanger his
eligibility. Thanks, NCAA, for
robbing me of a once-in-a-lifetime

Administrators
rake in millions
while athletes get
nothing.

opportunity.
But is unionizing the best
option to rectifying these in
justices? Perhaps. Unionizing
legally requiring athletes
to have a seat at the negotia
tion table —is one way to
provide collegians with the
voice they deserve. However,
it will be an arduous, long
process before all NCAA ath

letes gain representation.
Meanwhile, Emmert and

As I was watching what
turned out to be a
thrilling national title
matchup between
UConn and Kentucky
a few nights ago, there was one thing
in particular that stood out to me.
And no, it wasn't James Young's
Jerry World-shattering dunk, nor was
it Shabazz Napier's step-back dag
gers.
Coach Kevin Ollie's composure
was impressive, but that's still not it.
Was it the barely above-average an
nouncing from Nantz, Kerr and An
thony on CBS? Nope. But you're get
ting warmer.
What stuck out to me the most
as it had for the entire NCAA Tour
nament —was the electronic banner
that ran along the scorers' bench
reading "Celebrating student-ath
letes." The message furnished by the
NCAA and its corporate partners
was front and center and just em
phasized to me that no matter how
many logical arguments to replace
the current system are thrown their
way or how many lawsuits pile up on
their attorneys' desks, Mark Em
mert and company will doggedly
hold on to the existing student-ath
lete model until someone pries it
from their hands.

And who would blame them? As
constituted, the NCAAs business
model allows its administrators to
rake in millions of dollars in annual
compensation while the athletes get
nothing. Zero. Zilch. Nada. To pre
empt the obvious counterargument: a
scholarship is not compensation; it is
an employment contract. Free cloth
ing and footwear are nothing but
brand exposure. The admissions
process amounts to little more than a
background check. Collegiate ath
letes are not just students; they are
employees working for their universi
ties — ultimately lining the pockets
of overseers like Emmert. To argue
anything to the contrary is to have an
agenda.
But finally, at long last, the un
fairness and inherent contradictions
of the NCAAs "student-athlete" sys
tem may slowly be starting to
change.
In a landmark decision last
month, Region 13 of the National La
bor Relations Board paved the way
for football players at Northwestern
University to unionize. This case
comes in the wake of mounting exter
nal pressure on the NCAA to recon
sider the amateur status of its ath
letes, including the impending Ed
O'Bannon lawsuit and Jeffrey
Kessler's recently filed anti-trust liti
gation. All of these legal proceedings
have cast an ever-darkening shadow
on the NCAA, which has increasing
ly come under fire for what I feel are
utterly unjust rules preventing ath
letes from profiting of off their per
formance and likenesses.
Despite the withering criticism,
Emmert and his cronies have stood
firm. In a press conference preceding
the men's Final Four, the NCAAs
boss remarked that the unionization
of collegiate athletes would be a
"grossly inappropriate" method to
amending the existing system.
I'll tell you what's grossly inap
propriate: putting young men on a
stage in the middle of a billion-dollar
playpen with millions of eyes watch
ing their every move and then dis
possessing them of the exorbitant
profits their blood, sweat and tears
bought.
It's grossly inappropriate when
Napier claims that there are "hun
gry nights that I go to bed starving."
It's grossly inappropriate when
athletes put so much time 40,50,
60 hours a week in some cases
into their job of competing for their
university that it's simply impossi
ble to have another job that covers
the expenses a scholarship doesn't.
It's grossly inappropriate when
this writer can't be an extra in a
movie about running because such
participation would endanger his
eligibility. Thanks, NCAA, for
robbing me of a once-in-a-lifetime

Administrators

opportunity.
But is unionizing the best
option to rectifying these in
justices? Perhaps. Unionizing
legally requiring athletes
to have a seat at the negotia
tion table —is one way to
provide collegians with the
voice they deserve. However,
it will be an arduous, long
process before all NCAA ath

letes gain representation.
