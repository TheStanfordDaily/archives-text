## Card face top dog Huskies Stanford seeks second Pac-12 series victory 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Whether it's Connecticut or Washington,
Huskies are the top dogs around the nation
right now. This weekend, Stanford baseball (11-
14, 3-6 Pac-12) travels to Seattle for a three
game series to face the No. 8 Washington
Huskies (22-6-1, 10-2 Pac-12), who rather sur
prisingly stand atop the Pac-12.
After starting the season 3-4-1, the Huskies
have gone 19-2 in their last 21 games to climb
all the way to the top of the Pac-12 and into the
top 10 teams in the nation. In the preseason,
Pac-12 coaches projected Washington to finish
10th in the conference.
Despite starting conference play against ar
guably some of the Pac-12's weaker teams so
far in USC, Arizona and Arizona State, the
Huskies validated their prolific star! with last
weekend's series win against conference rival
No. 12 Oregon. Washington was blown out in
the first game of the series on Friday at home,
10-3, before recovering to win the series with a
1-0 victory on Saturday and a 5-4 walk-off vic
tory in ten innings on Sunday.
The surge in play has seen the Huskies' of
fense average 6.3 runs per game over their past
21 games, which greatly contrasts the Cardi
nal's 3.4 runs per game over their last 16
games. The Huskies boast six regular starters
who hit above .300 and their .289 team average
ranks third in the conference. The team's 14
home runs are good for first in the Pac-12.
Junior second baseman Andrew Ely leads
Washington with a .373 batting average, which
is fifth in the Pac-12, and enters the series on a
16-game hitting streak. Similarly, senior out
fielder Brian Wolfe leads the team with four
home runs and 22 RBIs, despite only having
started in 22 of the team's 29 games. Wolfe's
emergence as the cleanup hitter for the
Huskies has come after he only hit .233 in 20
starts last season. He's currently hitting .370
this year for Washington.
On the mound, Washington has seen moder
ate success so far this season, as the team's 3.42
ERA places it fifth in the Pac-12, right behind
Stanford. The team has allowed 3.5 runs per
game in its 12 Pac-12 contests so far.
Junior weekend starters Tyler Davis and
Jeff Brigham have dominated on the mound for
Washington after up-and-down freshman and
sophomore years. Davis, who went 2-7 with a
5.11 ERA last season, has gone 6-1 with a 1.16
ERA in seven starts this season. In similarly
