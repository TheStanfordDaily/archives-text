## Card face top dog Huskies Stanford seeks second Pac-12 series victory 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Whether it's Connecticut or Washington,
Huskies are the top dogs around the nation
right now. This weekend, Stanford baseball (11-
14, 3-6 Pac-12) travels to Seattle for a three
game series to face the No. 8 Washington
Huskies (22-6-1, 10-2 Pac-12), who rather sur
prisingly stand atop the Pac-12.
After starting the season 3-4-1, the Huskies
have gone 19-2 in their last 21 games to climb
all the way to the top of the Pac-12 and into the
top 10 teams in the nation. In the preseason,
Pac-12 coaches projected Washington to finish
10th in the conference.
Despite starting conference play against ar
guably some of the Pac-12's weaker teams so
far in USC, Arizona and Arizona State, the
Huskies validated their prolific star! with last
weekend's series win against conference rival
No. 12 Oregon. Washington was blown out in
the first game of the series on Friday at home,
10-3, before recovering to win the series with a
1-0 victory on Saturday and a 5-4 walk-off vic
tory in ten innings on Sunday.
The surge in play has seen the Huskies' of
fense average 6.3 runs per game over their past
21 games, which greatly contrasts the Cardi
nal's 3.4 runs per game over their last 16
games. The Huskies boast six regular starters
who hit above .300 and their .289 team average
ranks third in the conference. The team's 14
home runs are good for first in the Pac-12.
Junior second baseman Andrew Ely leads
Washington with a .373 batting average, which
is fifth in the Pac-12, and enters the series on a
16-game hitting streak. Similarly, senior out
fielder Brian Wolfe leads the team with four
home runs and 22 RBIs, despite only having
started in 22 of the team's 29 games. Wolfe's
emergence as the cleanup hitter for the
Huskies has come after he only hit .233 in 20
starts last season. He's currently hitting .370
this year for Washington.
On the mound, Washington has seen moder
ate success so far this season, as the team's 3.42
ERA places it fifth in the Pac-12, right behind
Stanford. The team has allowed 3.5 runs per
game in its 12 Pac-12 contests so far.
Junior weekend starters Tyler Davis and
Jeff Brigham have dominated on the mound for
Washington after up-and-down freshman and
sophomore years. Davis, who went 2-7 with a
5.11 ERA last season, has gone 6-1 with a 1.16
ERA in seven starts this season. In similarly
surprising fashion, Brigham
has started the season 4-0
with a 1.77 ERA in eight
starts after missing last sea
son completely due to injury.
However, the pitcher ex
pected to be the Huskies'
ace, junior Jared Fisher, has
disappointed so far. Fisher
finished last season with a 2-
2 record and a 3.20 ERA in
10 starts and began the sea
son as the Friday night
starter, where he has still
pitched for most of the sea
son. This year, though, Fish
er has only posted a 2-3
record with a 5.73 ERA in
eight starts.
For the Cardinal, their
streak of 25 straight games
to start the season with a
freshman on the mound
could come to an end this
weekend. Freshman pitcher
Chris Viall struggled in his
last two outings, surrender
ing six earned runs in 2.2
combined innings pitched af
ter a promising start to the
season. At the same time,
junior southpaw John
Hochstatter impressed with
6.2 scoreless innings pitched
in relief of Viall against Ore
gon State. Hochstatter also
served as the Saturday
starter for much of last sea-

The other two starting
spots on the weekend for
Stanford will go to freshmen
Brett Hanewich and Cal
Quantrill. Both pitchers
have exceeded expectations
this season, as Hanewich en

ters the series with a 1-2
record and a 2.75 ERA and
Quantrill enters with a 3-2
record and a 2.60 ERA.
Quantrill has shined as of
late —he had a streak of
17.1 innings pitched without
an earned run snapped
against USC on March 22nd
and a streak of 26.1 innings
pitched without allowing a
walk snapped last weekend
against Oregon State. Over
his last six starts, Quantrill
has thrown 38.1 innings
while allowing only three
earned runs and picking up
31 strikeouts.

At the plate, junior third
baseman Alex Blandino con
tinues to lead the Cardinal
after hitting a home run
against UC-Davis on Tues
day and begins the series
leading the team with a .318
average and three home
runs. The team scored seven
runs against UC-Davis, the
most runs it had scored
since it put up 11 runs
against Cal on March 4, a
stretch that spanned 13
games. In order to beat the
Huskies, Stanford must
score more than the two
runs it did in all three games
against Oregon State last
weekend.
The Cardinal will look to
earn all-important confer
ence wins this weekend after
losing their last four Pac-12
games. All three games be
tween Stanford and Wash
ington in Seattle will be
night contests, with first
pitch scheduled for 5 p.m. on
Friday, 6 p.m. on Saturday
and 4 p.m. on Sunday.

10-3, before recovering to win the series with a
1-0 victory on Saturday and a 5-4 walk-off vic
tory in ten innings on Sunday.
The surge in play has seen the Huskies' of
fense average 6.3 runs per game over their past
21 games, which greatly contrasts the Cardi
nal's 3.4 runs per game over their last 16
games. The Huskies boast six regular starters
who hit above .300 and their .289 team average
ranks third in the conference. The team's 14
home runs are good for first in the Pac-12.
Junior second baseman Andrew Ely leads
Washington with a .373 batting average, which
is fifth in the Pac-12, and enters the series on a
16-game hitting streak. Similarly, senior out
fielder Brian Wolfe leads the team with four
home runs and 22 RBIs, despite only having
started in 22 of the team's 29 games. Wolfe's
emergence as the cleanup hitter for the
Huskies has come after he only hit .233 in 20
starts last season. He's currently hitting .370
this year for Washington.
On the mound, Washington has seen moder
ate success so far this season, as the team's 3.42
ERA places it fifth in the Pac-12, right behind
Stanford. The team has allowed 3.5 runs per
game in its 12 Pac-12 contests so far.
Junior weekend starters Tyler Davis and
Jeff Brigham have dominated on the mound for
Washington after up-and-down freshman and
sophomore years. Davis, who went 2-7 with a
5.11 ERA last season, has gone 6-1 with a 1.16
ERA in seven starts this season. In similarly
surprising fashion, Brigham
has started the season 4-0
with a 1.77 ERA in eight
starts after missing last sea
son completely due to injury.
However, the pitcher ex
pected to be the Huskies'
ace, junior Jared Fisher, has
disappointed so far. Fisher
finished last season with a 2-
2 record and a 3.20 ERA in
10 starts and began the sea
son as the Friday night
starter, where he has still
pitched for most of the sea
son. This year, though, Fish
er has only posted a 2-3
record with a 5.73 ERA in
eight starts.
For the Cardinal, their
streak of 25 straight games
to start the season with a
freshman on the mound
could come to an end this
weekend. Freshman pitcher
Chris Viall struggled in his
last two outings, surrender
ing six earned runs in 2.2
combined innings pitched af
ter a promising start to the
season. At the same time,
junior southpaw John
Hochstatter impressed with
6.2 scoreless innings pitched
in relief of Viall against Ore
gon State. Hochstatter also
served as the Saturday
starter for much of last sea-

The other two starting
spots on the weekend for
Stanford will go to freshmen
Brett Hanewich and Cal
Quantrill. Both pitchers
have exceeded expectations
this season, as Hanewich en

ters the series with a 1-2
record and a 2.75 ERA and
Quantrill enters with a 3-2
record and a 2.60 ERA.
Quantrill has shined as of
late —he had a streak of
17.1 innings pitched without
an earned run snapped
against USC on March 22nd
and a streak of 26.1 innings
pitched without allowing a
walk snapped last weekend
against Oregon State. Over
his last six starts, Quantrill
has thrown 38.1 innings
while allowing only three
earned runs and picking up
31 strikeouts.

At the plate, junior third
baseman Alex Blandino con
tinues to lead the Cardinal
after hitting a home run
against UC-Davis on Tues
day and begins the series
leading the team with a .318
average and three home
runs. The team scored seven
runs against UC-Davis, the
most runs it had scored
since it put up 11 runs
against Cal on March 4, a
stretch that spanned 13
games. In order to beat the
Huskies, Stanford must
score more than the two
runs it did in all three games
against Oregon State last
weekend.
The Cardinal will look to
earn all-important confer
ence wins this weekend after
losing their last four Pac-12
games. All three games be
tween Stanford and Wash
ington in Seattle will be
night contests, with first
pitch scheduled for 5 p.m. on
Friday, 6 p.m. on Saturday
and 4 p.m. on Sunday.

Junior left-handed pitcher John Hochstatter (above) has
not been used out of the rotation so far this year, but could
start this weekend in place of a struggling Chris Viall.
Whether it's Connecticut or Washington,
Huskies are the top dogs around the nation
right now. This weekend, Stanford baseball (11-
14, 3-6 Pac-12) travels to Seattle for a three
game series to face the No. 8 Washington
Huskies (22-6-1, 10-2 Pac-12), who rather sur
prisingly stand atop the Pac-12.
After starting the season 3-4-1, the Huskies
have gone 19-2 in their last 21 games to climb
all the way to the top of the Pac-12 and into the
top 10 teams in the nation. In the preseason,
Pac-12 coaches projected Washington to finish
10th in the conference.
Despite starting conference play against ar
guably some of the Pac-12's weaker teams so
far in USC, Arizona and Arizona State, the
Huskies validated their prolific star! with last
weekend's series win against conference rival
No. 12 Oregon. Washington was blown out in
