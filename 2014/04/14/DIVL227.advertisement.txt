The Stanford Historical Society and Stanford Continuing Studies Present
Freedom Summer
This year marks the 50th anniversary of
one of the most consequential moments
in the history of the US Civil Rights
Movement. In June 1964, more than a
thousand college-aged, primarily white,
Northerners joined thousands of mostly
black civil rights workers in Mississippi
and Louisiana in a massive drive to register
African-American voters. Over the ten
weeks of the project, the volunteers were
victims of random shootings, more than
1,600 arrests, 80 serious beatings, and
four deaths.
In spite of the violence, Freedom Summer volunteers taught in thirty-eight "Freedom Schools," and
assisted the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP). This event brings together four
committed activists and scholars, some of whom were volunteers, and others who have studied
and written extensively about Freedom Summer. Join us for a program that honors a defining
moment in our nation's noblest struggle.
