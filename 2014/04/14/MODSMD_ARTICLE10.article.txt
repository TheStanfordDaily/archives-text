### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
First came No. 1 USC. Then
came No. 5 Arizona State. And to
complete the top-five trifecta, last
came No. 2 UCLA. Through the
toughest stretch of its schedule
featuring a trio of elite conference
opponents, No. 1 Stanford (19-1, 5-
0 MPSF) prevailed by defeating all
three in consecutive meetings, cap
ping the stretch off with a 9-8
downing of UCLA (22-3, 4-1) in a
battle of the nation's top two teams
on Friday before having no issues
in a drubbing of Cal State-Bakers
field (12-19,0-5) on Saturday.
Against a rugged UCLA de
fense that had held Stanford to its
two lowest offensive outputs of
this season (six goals and eight
goals) in the teams' last two meet
ings, the Cardinal offense was
able to do just enough with a late
push in the fourth period. While
the defense regressed from its

strong performances in its
matchups with USC and Arizona
State, it still made some key stops
in the fourth period against a
UCLA offense that has been in
consistent at times to maintain the
lead.

After the teams were dead
locked through the first period, al
ternating goals en route to a 2-2
score, goals from sophomore Mag
gie Steffens and senior Annika
Dries in the early minutes of the
second period put the Cardinal up
4-2 before each team finished the
half with two scores apiece to
make it a 6-4 Stanford advantage
heading into the break.
Despite the relative deadlock
of the first half, UCLA came out of
the break strong, scoring three

straight goals in a span of just
over three minutes to make quick
ly take a 7-6 lead and steal all of
the momentum in the match.
Stanford gained that momentum
back very quickly, however, when
junior Ashley Grossman scored
just 24 seconds after the final goal
of that run to tie the game up at 7-
7 and send it into the final frame.
After that, the defense took
over and propelled the Cardinal to
victory. Although the Cardinal
were shorthanded after being
called for a penalty, freshman
Jamie Neushul made a field block
that led to the ball quickly being
pushed down the pool for a score
from senior Kaley Dodson that
pushed the Cardinal to an 8-7 ad
vantage with 6:05 left in the match
that they would not relinquish.
