## Stanford escapes sweep Ingelsby earns two wins for UW 
### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Although Stanford (25-16, 2-10
Pac-12) was able to win the middle
game of its three-game series
against No. 10 Washington (24-11,
4-7 Pac-12) this weekend to avoid a
sweep, Washington senior pitcher
Kaitlin Ingelsby won both of her
starts to give Washington the other
two wins and deny Stanford its first
conference series win of the season
in the series finale.

While the result continued the
Cardinal's conference woes, the 13-
5 win over Washington in six in
nings on Saturday night neverthe
less gave the Stanford its first vic
tory over a top-25 RPI squad this
season. Ultimately, the result of
this weekend's series places im
mense importance on the Cardi
nal's trip to Salt Lake City next
weekend to take on the Utah Utes
(14-16, 3-11 Pac-12).
For most of the series, Stan
ford's lineup had no answer for In
gelsby, a 2013 First Team Ail-
American who was the 14th overall
selection in the 2014 National Pro

4/12, Smith Family Stadium
Fastpitch (NPF) Draft to the
Akron Racers. On Thursday night,
Ingelsby pitched a complete game
four-hit shutout, as the Huskies
knocked off the Cardinal by a score
of 7-0. And on Saturday night, after
her offense provided her a big lead,
Ingelsby held the Stanford offense
to just two runs one earned
over five innings en route to an 11-
2 Husky win.
However, in the Cardinal's 13-5
victory over the Huskies on Friday
night, Stanford's offense exploded
in the fifth and sixth innings. After
being held hitless during the first
four innings, the Card jumped all
over Husky starter Bryana Walker,
putting up eight runs on six hits in
the fifth against the Washington
pitching staff.
Walker's troubles began with a
walk to sophomore Jessica Plaza,
as the sophomore from Huntington
Beach, Calif., was able to battle
back from a 1-2 count to draw the
free pass. From there, Walker be
came wild, including throwing
first-pitch balls to three of the
next four batters. The Husky
senior from La Quinta, Calif.,
was unable to draw back from the
early deficits in the count, as Stan
ford proceeded to tee off on her de
liveries.
Freshman Bessie Noll followed
Plaza's walk with a single up the
middle before junior Cassandra
Roulund tied the score at two with
a two-run single to right-center
field. Afterwards, sophomore
Kaitlin Schaberg gave the Cardinal
its first lead with a single that man
aged to get over the glove of the
Husky shortstop Ali Aguilar, scor
ing junior Hanna Winter. Finally,
junior Leah White chased Walker
from the circle with an RBI single,
extending the Card's lead to 4-2.
Walker's exit from the game
would not prove to be the end of
Stanford's momentum, as sopho
more Kayla Bonstrom crushed the

first pitch she saw from Ingelsby,
who came on in relief of Walker.
Bonstrom's three-run homer gave
the Cardinal a 7-2 advantage and
from there, doubles by Plaza in the
fifth and the sixth drove home
three more runs and helped render
a late Washington comeback mean
ingless.
In batting around in the fifth
and sixth innings, the Cardinal
sent a combined 22 batters to the
plate, scoring their 13 runs on nine
hits and seven walks. The offensive
effort helped support a strong per
formance in the circle by freshman
Kylie Sorenson, who picked up her
third victory of the season after al
lowing two runs over 4.1 innings.
In just 67 pitches, Sorenson
helped stabilize the Cardinal's
pitching situation while controlling
Washington's offense. In particu
lar, the Huskies struggled to sus
tain any momentum against Soren
son when Washington was able to
get runners on they went 0-for
-5 at the plate with runners on base
against Sorenson.
While the win on Saturday
night provided a much-needed
spark for the Cardinal as they
reached the halfway point in Pac-12
play, Stanford will need to do more
over the final four series of the reg
ular season in order to ensure that
it makes the postseason. To that
end, head coach John Rittman de
scribed Utah, the Cardinal's next
opponent, "a different team than
they were last year."
"[Utah is] scoring runs and are
getting better pitching," Rittman
added. "They are also fighting for
their postseason lives as we are, so
we are going to have go in there
with our A-game' by pitching bet
ter, continuing to hit and play de
fense if we want to win the series."
Stanford and Utah will square
off in a three-game set this coming
weekend in Salt Lake City. Thurs
day and Friday's games will be tel
evised by Pac-12 Networks, and
Saturday's finale will be streamed

In just 67 pitches, Sorenson
helped stabilize the Cardinal's
pitching situation while controlling
Washington's offense. In particu
lar, the Huskies struggled to sus
tain any momentum against Soren
son when Washington was able to
get runners on they went 0-for
-5 at the plate with runners on base
against Sorenson.
While the win on Saturday
night provided a much-needed
spark for the Cardinal as they
reached the halfway point in Pac-12
play, Stanford will need to do more
over the final four series of the reg
ular season in order to ensure that
it makes the postseason. To that
end, head coach John Rittman de
scribed Utah, the Cardinal's next
opponent, "a different team than
they were last year."
"[Utah is] scoring runs and are
getting better pitching," Rittman
added. "They are also fighting for
their postseason lives as we are, so
we are going to have go in there
with our A-game' by pitching bet
ter, continuing to hit and play de
fense if we want to win the series."
Stanford and Utah will square
off in a three-game set this coming
weekend in Salt Lake City. Thurs
day and Friday's games will be tel
evised by Pac-12 Networks, and
Saturday's finale will be streamed

Junior center fielder Cassandra Roulund (above) went 3-for-7 with
three runs and two RBIs over the Cardinal's three-game set against No.
10 Washington. Stanford avoided the sweep with a 1 3-5 win on Friday.
Although Stanford (25-16, 2-10
Pac-12) was able to win the middle
game of its three-game series
against No. 10 Washington (24-11,
4-7 Pac-12) this weekend to avoid a
sweep, Washington senior pitcher
Kaitlin Ingelsby won both of her
starts to give Washington the other
two wins and deny Stanford its first
conference series win of the season
in the series finale.

While the result continued the
Cardinal's conference woes, the 13-
5 win over Washington in six in
nings on Saturday night neverthe
less gave the Stanford its first vic
tory over a top-25 RPI squad this
season. Ultimately, the result of
this weekend's series places im
mense importance on the Cardi
nal's trip to Salt Lake City next
weekend to take on the Utah Utes
(14-16, 3-11 Pac-12).
For most of the series, Stan
ford's lineup had no answer for In
gelsby, a 2013 First Team Ail-
American who was the 14th overall
selection in the 2014 National Pro

Fastpitch (NPF) Draft to the
Akron Racers. On Thursday night,
Ingelsby pitched a complete game
four-hit shutout, as the Huskies
knocked off the Cardinal by a score
of 7-0. And on Saturday night, after
her offense provided her a big lead,
Ingelsby held the Stanford offense
to just two runs one earned
over five innings en route to an 11-
2 Husky win.
However, in the Cardinal's 13-5
victory over the Huskies on Friday
night, Stanford's offense exploded
in the fifth and sixth innings. After
being held hitless during the first
four innings, the Card jumped all
over Husky starter Bryana Walker,
putting up eight runs on six hits in
the fifth against the Washington
pitching staff.
Walker's troubles began with a
walk to sophomore Jessica Plaza,
as the sophomore from Huntington
Beach, Calif., was able to battle
back from a 1-2 count to draw the
free pass. From there, Walker be
came wild, including throwing
first-pitch balls to three of the
next four batters. The Husky
senior from La Quinta, Calif.,
was unable to draw back from the
early deficits in the count, as Stan
ford proceeded to tee off on her de
liveries.
Freshman Bessie Noll followed
Plaza's walk with a single up the
middle before junior Cassandra
Roulund tied the score at two with
a two-run single to right-center
field. Afterwards, sophomore
Kaitlin Schaberg gave the Cardinal
its first lead with a single that man
aged to get over the glove of the
Husky shortstop Ali Aguilar, scor
ing junior Hanna Winter. Finally,
junior Leah White chased Walker
from the circle with an RBI single,
extending the Card's lead to 4-2.
Walker's exit from the game
would not prove to be the end of
Stanford's momentum, as sopho
more Kayla Bonstrom crushed the

first pitch she saw from Ingelsby,
who came on in relief of Walker.
Bonstrom's three-run homer gave
the Cardinal a 7-2 advantage and
from there, doubles by Plaza in the
fifth and the sixth drove home
three more runs and helped render
a late Washington comeback mean
ingless.
In batting around in the fifth
and sixth innings, the Cardinal
sent a combined 22 batters to the
plate, scoring their 13 runs on nine
hits and seven walks. The offensive
effort helped support a strong per
formance in the circle by freshman
Kylie Sorenson, who picked up her
third victory of the season after al
lowing two runs over 4.1 innings.
In just 67 pitches, Sorenson
helped stabilize the Cardinal's
pitching situation while controlling
