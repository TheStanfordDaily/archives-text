## Stanford escapes sweep Ingelsby earns two wins for UW 
### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Although Stanford (25-16, 2-10
Pac-12) was able to win the middle
game of its three-game series
against No. 10 Washington (24-11,
4-7 Pac-12) this weekend to avoid a
sweep, Washington senior pitcher
Kaitlin Ingelsby won both of her
starts to give Washington the other
two wins and deny Stanford its first
conference series win of the season
in the series finale.

While the result continued the
Cardinal's conference woes, the 13-
5 win over Washington in six in
nings on Saturday night neverthe
less gave the Stanford its first vic
tory over a top-25 RPI squad this
season. Ultimately, the result of
this weekend's series places im
mense importance on the Cardi
nal's trip to Salt Lake City next
weekend to take on the Utah Utes
(14-16, 3-11 Pac-12).
For most of the series, Stan
ford's lineup had no answer for In
gelsby, a 2013 First Team Ail-
American who was the 14th overall
selection in the 2014 National Pro
