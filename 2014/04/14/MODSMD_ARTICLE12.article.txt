# SPORTS BRIEF
## Men's gymnastics takes third at NCAA Championships; five gymnasts earn seven All-America honors 
### â€“ Do-Hyoung Park 
No. 4 Stanford men's gymnastics finished
another successful season with a third-place
showing at the NCAA Championships in Ann
Arbor, Mich., over the weekend with a team
score of 436.300, which placed it behind first
place Michigan (445.050) and second-place

Oklahoma (441.650). The result marked the
eighth top-three national finish in the last nine
years for the Cardinal.
Freshman Akash Modi further cemented his
status as one of the top all-around gymnasts in
the nation, as his all-around score of 89.200
earned him second place at the event behind on
ly Michigan's Sam Mikulak.
Although the Cardinal had strong perform
ances in both the floor (74.150) and parallel bars
(74.900), weak showings in both the pommel

horse (70.800) and high bar (70.850) dragged
Stanford's overall showing down and stopped it
from keeping pace with Michigan, which sur
passed the 75.000 mark on the floor, pommel
horse and parallel bars to propel itself far ahead
of the field. In comparison, Oklahoma had two
events in which it scored 75.000 or higher while
Stanford had none.
Also at the team event, five Cardinal gym-
nasts advanced to Saturday's
NCAA Individual Event Finals
with their top-10 finishes in their
events: junior Brian Knott on par

allel bars, junior Michael Levy on
floor, Modi on pommel horse and
parallel bars, senior Sean Senters
on floor and vault and sophomore
Dennis Zaremski on rings and par
allel bars.
At the individual finals, all five
qualifying gymnasts earned All-
America honors with successful fin
ishes in all of their events, with the

only exception being Zaremski,
whose performance on the parallel
bars fell just short. However, the
sophomore's fifth-place finish in
the rings, the other event that he
qualified in, was more than enough
to secure his second career Ail-
American honor.
