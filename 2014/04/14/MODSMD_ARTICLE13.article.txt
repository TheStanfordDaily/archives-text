## OP-ED Making Stanford more competitive through schedule shift 
### 
Stanford is a quirky university
that holds pride in its mod
ern founding. From our band
to fountain hopping and Full Moon
on the Quad, we have traditions
that are not too antiquated, but
which have rather evolved with
the University to be open and to
be socially conscious (to the best
of their abilities) while still hold
ing on to their sense of tradition.
One major area where Stan
ford University has held on to as a
tradition, however much to my
chagrin is its academic calen
dar, which starts so much later
than most semester schools. The
reason, quite sensible in a vacuum,
is so that our fall trimester finish
es at winter break. This schedul
ing, though well-intentioned, has
many negative consequences for
students and puts us at an aca
demic disadvantage to comparable
semester schools. In general, the
problem is not that we start the
year so late, but rather, that the
late start date forces us to end late
as well.
Although the quarter system
allows us to take more courses
than students at most other uni
versities, many summer research
and internship programs have
very specific starting dates for
which students must be at for
training, orientation and so on.
These dates tend to begin around
Week 9 of spring quarter, dead
week or final exams. Programs
cannot make special exceptions to
train Stanford students (read: one
or two individuals) at a separate
time from everyone else. As a re
sult of this, many summer posi
tions are automatically impossible
for Stanford students to attend.
For a school that prides itself on
producing graduates with a "prac
tical education," it seems odd that
we would align our calendar to put
students at such a disadvantage.
Moreover, there is a social dis
advantage that every student
from pre-freshman to rising sen
ior knows: the awkward month at
the end of the summer when every
one of their friends has left for
school and they are sitting at
home or work with no one around.
While it is true that this quirk cre
ates an opportunity to visit friends
at nearby schools, it can also be
quite isolating.
The social problem also further
extends to athletics on campus.
Because NCAA bases its schedule
around those of the majority of uni
versities (i.e. not Stanford), athletic
events begin well before our school
year does. As a New Englander, I
personally recall missing three of
Stanford's home games two years
ago half the home schedule
because I was at home, but our ath
letics schedule had begun a month
earlier.
The flip side of this is that fall
athletes get to be on campus without
having to take classes for the first
portion of their season, allowing
them to focus on their training, but
it certainly makes it difficult for
most of the roughly 50 percent of
the student body from outside of
California to attend their friends'
sports games. This consequence al
so extends beyond sports to non
varsity extracurricular activities.
For example, many universities hold
mock trial, debate and model United
Nations conferences before our year
starts, effectively preventing Stan
ford students from competing.
While there are many problems
associated with our schedule, there
are also solutions. We might sim
ply, for example, move the start of
the school year five weeks earlier
and begin winter break halfway
through our winter quarter, lining
up nicely with the end of midterms
(in other words, forcing teachers
to make winter midterms actually
come midway through the term).
This would have the added benefit
of adding a much needed break in
the middle of winter quarter,
which has no vacations and thus a
reputation on campus for being
quite depressing. Some might ar
gue that they do not want to have
to remember knowledge over va
cations, but for an academic insti
tution, that is not a fantastic argu
ment.
Shifting everything in this
manner would also allow us to
have a longer winter break like
most other universities. That
would give students more time to
be at home and catch up with their
friends. Furthermore, it would al
low spring quarter to start and
finish four weeks earlier, eliminat

ing the disadvantage in the job/in
ternship search.
For a university proud of the
fact that our youth allows us to
evolve with the times, not wedded
to antiquated traditions, our late
academic calendar is one tradition
that could certainly some reconsid
eration.

that are not too antiquated, but
which have rather evolved with
the University to be open and to
be socially conscious (to the best
of their abilities) while still hold
ing on to their sense of tradition.
One major area where Stan
ford University has held on to as a
tradition, however much to my
chagrin is its academic calen
dar, which starts so much later
than most semester schools. The
reason, quite sensible in a vacuum,
is so that our fall trimester finish
es at winter break. This schedul
ing, though well-intentioned, has
many negative consequences for
students and puts us at an aca
demic disadvantage to comparable
semester schools. In general, the
problem is not that we start the
year so late, but rather, that the
late start date forces us to end late
as well.
Although the quarter system
allows us to take more courses
than students at most other uni
versities, many summer research
and internship programs have
very specific starting dates for
which students must be at for
training, orientation and so on.
These dates tend to begin around
Week 9 of spring quarter, dead
week or final exams. Programs
cannot make special exceptions to
train Stanford students (read: one
or two individuals) at a separate
time from everyone else. As a re
sult of this, many summer posi
tions are automatically impossible
for Stanford students to attend.
For a school that prides itself on
producing graduates with a "prac
tical education," it seems odd that
we would align our calendar to put
students at such a disadvantage.
Moreover, there is a social dis
advantage that every student
from pre-freshman to rising sen
ior knows: the awkward month at
the end of the summer when every
one of their friends has left for
school and they are sitting at
home or work with no one around.
While it is true that this quirk cre
ates an opportunity to visit friends
at nearby schools, it can also be
quite isolating.
The social problem also further
extends to athletics on campus.
Because NCAA bases its schedule
around those of the majority of uni
versities (i.e. not Stanford), athletic
events begin well before our school
year does. As a New Englander, I
personally recall missing three of
Stanford's home games two years
ago half the home schedule
because I was at home, but our ath
letics schedule had begun a month
earlier.
The flip side of this is that fall
athletes get to be on campus without
having to take classes for the first
portion of their season, allowing
them to focus on their training, but
it certainly makes it difficult for
most of the roughly 50 percent of
the student body from outside of
California to attend their friends'
sports games. This consequence al
so extends beyond sports to non
varsity extracurricular activities.
For example, many universities hold
mock trial, debate and model United
Nations conferences before our year
starts, effectively preventing Stan
ford students from competing.
While there are many problems
associated with our schedule, there
are also solutions. We might sim
ply, for example, move the start of
the school year five weeks earlier
and begin winter break halfway
through our winter quarter, lining
up nicely with the end of midterms
(in other words, forcing teachers
to make winter midterms actually
come midway through the term).
This would have the added benefit
of adding a much needed break in
the middle of winter quarter,
which has no vacations and thus a
reputation on campus for being
quite depressing. Some might ar
gue that they do not want to have
to remember knowledge over va
cations, but for an academic insti
tution, that is not a fantastic argu
ment.
Shifting everything in this
manner would also allow us to
have a longer winter break like
most other universities. That
would give students more time to
be at home and catch up with their
friends. Furthermore, it would al
low spring quarter to start and
finish four weeks earlier, eliminat

ing the disadvantage in the job/in
ternship search.
For a university proud of the
fact that our youth allows us to
evolve with the times, not wedded
to antiquated traditions, our late
academic calendar is one tradition
that could certainly some reconsid
eration.
