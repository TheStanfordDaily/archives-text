# FROM THE OPINIONS DESK
## A 						little bit of perspective: SAFE Reform, the ASSU and April 13, 1971 
### Winston Shi 
Last week's ASSU election was the loudest
I've seen in a while. I've heard invocations
of racism, ad hominem attacks and cute
marketing campaigns. My dorm email list was
shut down because of the political flame wars,
and from what I've seen of other chats, mine was
one of the quieter ones. But let me try to put the
ASSU election in perspective. Although this was
a pretty hotly contested election as modern Stan
ford elections go, it certainly wasn't anything like
the chaos of 2012, and if you'll allow a future his
tory major to appeal to his chosen subject, in
general Stanford hasn't been very controversial
for a long time.
Allow me to explain. The Daily office has a
collection of 25 significant Daily covers gracing
its newsroom walls, most of which commemorate
the sort of events you would expect the first
issue of The Daily, the election of Herbert
Hoover, the end of World War 11, Stanford's hun
dredth anniversary and a number of significant
football victories. To see these comparatively
humdrum headlines from before JFK and after
Reagan puts the chaos of the 1960s and 1970s in
sharper perspective. If The Daily is a decent
barometer of Stanford's collective consciousness
and I would hope it is these two decades
were the only period in Stanford's history when
social issues were the talk of the town. That was
the spirit of the times; it is now gone. The rest is
not silence, but it is starkly quiet.
On Nov. 22, 1963, a special edition was re
leased in the wake of JFK's assassination; a disbe
lieving below-fold headline reads "It Can't Happen
Here." 1966 saw the legalization of campus drink
ing (contraceptives were still banned), a night-long
draft protest and one of the first steps towards of
ficial non-Christian religious services on campus.
Protesting members of the Black community were
as bold as they had ever been, forcing the Univer
sity to promise increased minority enrollment and
better privileges on campus.
That brings us to April 13,1971 probably the
most important cover in The Daily's history.
Topping the paper above the very name of
the newspaper itself â€”was the revelation that
the Palo Alto police had searched The Daily's of
fice to find evidence against hospital protesters.
Seven years later, after the ensuing lawsuit had
finally wound its way through the courts, The
Daily would lose the landmark Supreme Court
case Ziircher v. Stanford Daily, allowing po
lice to search newsrooms for evidence. It is one of
the few times, albeit an infamous one, that a col
lege newspaper has ever done anything of na
tional significance.
The hospital protesters were, as it turned out,
members of the Black Advisory Committee,
which staged a "violent" sit-in at the Medical
Center and issued a set of "non-negotiable" de
mands to the acting dean of the School of Medi
cine. They demanded that the University be sep
arated from the Hospital; that Stanford drop all
charges against demonstrators, pay their legal
fees and cover any demonstration-related med
ical expenses; that the acting dean that they were
issuing demands to resign. A 350-person rally
converged on the Medical Center lawn after po
lice broke up the sit-in. To provide a comparison,
the David Petraeus protest brought in maybe 50.
Nearby, in Palo Alto proper, President
Richard Lyman and a number of other adminis
trators were being sued for "sexist-racist" ad
missions policies. The dean of undergraduate ad
missions, Fred Hargadon, had outlined what was
described as a series of quotas as the lawsuit
quoted, "500 women, 700 men, 75 blacks, 71 Mex
ican-Americans, and 21 American Indians." We'll
take the statement at face value for the sake of
argument the gender quota was a holdover
from the Jane Stanford era, when Mrs. Stanford
decided to focus the University on male educa
tion; today, the racial percentage for blacks has
increased a tad, from 6.25 percent to 7.32 per
cent, the Hispanic figure has nearly tripled and
the Native American one has actually declined. (I
pass over the fact that Asians are not even men
tioned.) But changes aside, we certainly don't see
people picketing Montag Hall.
The last headline, and the one most relevant
to Stanford today, was entitled "Voters Face Di
vergent Choices."
Things have changed since 1971. Consider the
ASSU Exec slates: Chris Hocker '73 and Robin
Friedman '73 promised to "dismantle[e]" the AS
SU and eliminate student fees, then just $1 a
quarter.
"If an organization is truly legitimate, it will
get its own money," Hocker a self-described

libertarian declared. The other slate, featur
ing Doug McHenry '73, Diane Fields '72 J.D. '75,
Ann Kimball '72 and current Stanford professor
Larry Diamond '73 M.A. '7B Ph.D. 'BO, supported
tripling the fee. (They won.)
All of this seems a little ridiculous. Even in
1971, three dollars a year was not a backbreaking
amount of money. And though the word
"tripling" sounds like a huge jump, nine dollars a
year was not a lot of money either. Today, now
that Stanford has the highest student activities
fee in the country, the protest has been not from
libertarians seeking to eliminate what power the
ASSU has but student groups seeking to main
tain the gains they currently enjoy a protest
reminiscent of leftism in today's France, where
student leader Raphael Glucksmann declared
that he wants to "reject all reforms." (The New
York Times, not the most conservative newspa
per in the world, snarkily commented, "The So
cialists have become a conservative party")
I understand the desire to rationalize student
group budgets out of principle, and it's one that I
generally sympathize with. I supported SAFE
Reform, and I still think that some kind of reor
ganization of student activities is necessary.
Some groups need to accumulate reserves, but
most student groups seem content to store ex
cess cash in the bank forever, preparing for an
Armageddon that will likely never come. Be
sides, student fees are $143 a quarter; SAFE Re
form would cut that figure by about 10 percent,
but that's still a fairly large sum.
And yet, what we, both as individuals and as a
community, get from our student groups is worth
far more than $143 per quarter. Stanford is
blessed with a vibrant set of opportunities, and

student largesse makes that possible. The student
body recognizes this. Stanford is a calmer place
than it was 40 years ago because we see an emerg
ing sense of consensus on the Farm. To be sure,
part of me does yearn for the time when ASSU
elections were major referenda on the principles
underlying the very nature of student life at Stan
ford. But that is nostalgia for nostalgia's sake.
If you're looking for a taste of some time-hon
ored college campus controversy, Stanford might
be a little boring. The Daily is an independent
newspaper that doesn't get searched anymore,
even if that is because we don't have any poten
tially violent events to cover. The Black Student
Union is not hosting sit-ins across campus, and
even though we like to say that the Admissions
Office is probably more controversial than it ever
has been, it really isn't.
For those of you who think the ASSU election
or the SAFE controversy were major, I must re
mind you that they weren't. Forty years ago, the
ASSU and student groups at Stanford faced the
kind of existential crisis that today's student
groups merely invoke for the sake of rhetoric.
For students to squabble over whether or not the
Stanford Flipside should get a Segway seems, in
comparison, positively minor. (They did. It's hon
estly a small price to pay for humor.) Some re
form of SAFE will eventually get passed, and the
Flipside will probably break their Segway and
successfully order a new one. We wouldn't want it
any other way.

Now that the Flipside has a Segway, Winston
Shi wants The Daily to get a golf cart. Convince
him, to upgrade to a Benz at wshi9k@

ford. But that is nostalgia for nostalgia's sake.
If you're looking for a taste of some time-hon
ored college campus controversy, Stanford might
be a little boring. The Daily is an independent
newspaper that doesn't get searched anymore,
even if that is because we don't have any poten
tially violent events to cover. The Black Student
Union is not hosting sit-ins across campus, and
even though we like to say that the Admissions
Office is probably more controversial than it ever
has been, it really isn't.
For those of you who think the ASSU election
or the SAFE controversy were major, I must re
mind you that they weren't. Forty years ago, the
ASSU and student groups at Stanford faced the
kind of existential crisis that today's student
groups merely invoke for the sake of rhetoric.
For students to squabble over whether or not the
Stanford Flipside should get a Segway seems, in
comparison, positively minor. (They did. It's hon
estly a small price to pay for humor.) Some re
form of SAFE will eventually get passed, and the
Flipside will probably break their Segway and
successfully order a new one. We wouldn't want it
any other way.

Last week's ASSU election was the loudest
I've seen in a while. I've heard invocations
of racism, ad hominem attacks and cute
marketing campaigns. My dorm email list was
shut down because of the political flame wars,
and from what I've seen of other chats, mine was
one of the quieter ones. But let me try to put the
ASSU election in perspective. Although this was
a pretty hotly contested election as modern Stan
ford elections go, it certainly wasn't anything like
the chaos of 2012, and if you'll allow a future his
tory major to appeal to his chosen subject, in
general Stanford hasn't been very controversial
for a long time.
Allow me to explain. The Daily office has a
collection of 25 significant Daily covers gracing
its newsroom walls, most of which commemorate
the sort of events you would expect the first
issue of The Daily, the election of Herbert
Hoover, the end of World War 11, Stanford's hun
dredth anniversary and a number of significant
football victories. To see these comparatively
humdrum headlines from before JFK and after
Reagan puts the chaos of the 1960s and 1970s in
sharper perspective. If The Daily is a decent
barometer of Stanford's collective consciousness
and I would hope it is these two decades
were the only period in Stanford's history when
social issues were the talk of the town. That was
the spirit of the times; it is now gone. The rest is
not silence, but it is starkly quiet.
On Nov. 22, 1963, a special edition was re
leased in the wake of JFK's assassination; a disbe
lieving below-fold headline reads "It Can't Happen
Here." 1966 saw the legalization of campus drink
ing (contraceptives were still banned), a night-long
draft protest and one of the first steps towards of
ficial non-Christian religious services on campus.
Protesting members of the Black community were
as bold as they had ever been, forcing the Univer
sity to promise increased minority enrollment and
better privileges on campus.
That brings us to April 13,1971 probably the
most important cover in The Daily's history.
Topping the paper above the very name of
the newspaper itself â€”was the revelation that
the Palo Alto police had searched The Daily's of
fice to find evidence against hospital protesters.
Seven years later, after the ensuing lawsuit had
finally wound its way through the courts, The
Daily would lose the landmark Supreme Court
case Ziircher v. Stanford Daily, allowing po
lice to search newsrooms for evidence. It is one of
the few times, albeit an infamous one, that a col
lege newspaper has ever done anything of na
tional significance.
The hospital protesters were, as it turned out,
members of the Black Advisory Committee,
which staged a "violent" sit-in at the Medical
Center and issued a set of "non-negotiable" de
mands to the acting dean of the School of Medi
cine. They demanded that the University be sep
arated from the Hospital; that Stanford drop all
charges against demonstrators, pay their legal
fees and cover any demonstration-related med
ical expenses; that the acting dean that they were
issuing demands to resign. A 350-person rally
converged on the Medical Center lawn after po
lice broke up the sit-in. To provide a comparison,
the David Petraeus protest brought in maybe 50.
Nearby, in Palo Alto proper, President
Richard Lyman and a number of other adminis
trators were being sued for "sexist-racist" ad
missions policies. The dean of undergraduate ad
missions, Fred Hargadon, had outlined what was
described as a series of quotas as the lawsuit
quoted, "500 women, 700 men, 75 blacks, 71 Mex
ican-Americans, and 21 American Indians." We'll
take the statement at face value for the sake of
argument the gender quota was a holdover
from the Jane Stanford era, when Mrs. Stanford
decided to focus the University on male educa
tion; today, the racial percentage for blacks has
increased a tad, from 6.25 percent to 7.32 per
cent, the Hispanic figure has nearly tripled and
the Native American one has actually declined. (I
pass over the fact that Asians are not even men
tioned.) But changes aside, we certainly don't see
people picketing Montag Hall.
The last headline, and the one most relevant
to Stanford today, was entitled "Voters Face Di
vergent Choices."
Things have changed since 1971. Consider the
ASSU Exec slates: Chris Hocker '73 and Robin
Friedman '73 promised to "dismantle[e]" the AS
SU and eliminate student fees, then just $1 a
quarter.
"If an organization is truly legitimate, it will
get its own money," Hocker a self-described

libertarian declared. The other slate, featur
ing Doug McHenry '73, Diane Fields '72 J.D. '75,
Ann Kimball '72 and current Stanford professor
Larry Diamond '73 M.A. '7B Ph.D. 'BO, supported
tripling the fee. (They won.)
All of this seems a little ridiculous. Even in
1971, three dollars a year was not a backbreaking
amount of money. And though the word
"tripling" sounds like a huge jump, nine dollars a
year was not a lot of money either. Today, now
that Stanford has the highest student activities
fee in the country, the protest has been not from
libertarians seeking to eliminate what power the
ASSU has but student groups seeking to main
tain the gains they currently enjoy a protest
reminiscent of leftism in today's France, where
student leader Raphael Glucksmann declared
that he wants to "reject all reforms." (The New
York Times, not the most conservative newspa
per in the world, snarkily commented, "The So
cialists have become a conservative party")
I understand the desire to rationalize student
group budgets out of principle, and it's one that I
generally sympathize with. I supported SAFE
Reform, and I still think that some kind of reor
ganization of student activities is necessary.
Some groups need to accumulate reserves, but
most student groups seem content to store ex
cess cash in the bank forever, preparing for an
Armageddon that will likely never come. Be
sides, student fees are $143 a quarter; SAFE Re
form would cut that figure by about 10 percent,
but that's still a fairly large sum.
And yet, what we, both as individuals and as a
community, get from our student groups is worth
far more than $143 per quarter. Stanford is
blessed with a vibrant set of opportunities, and

student largesse makes that possible. The student
body recognizes this. Stanford is a calmer place
than it was 40 years ago because we see an emerg
ing sense of consensus on the Farm. To be sure,
part of me does yearn for the time when ASSU
elections were major referenda on the principles
underlying the very nature of student life at Stan
ford. But that is nostalgia for nostalgia's sake.
If you're looking for a taste of some time-hon

that he wants to "reject all reforms." (The New
York Times, not the most conservative newspa
per in the world, snarkily commented, "The So
cialists have become a conservative party")
I understand the desire to rationalize student
group budgets out of principle, and it's one that I
generally sympathize with. I supported SAFE
Reform, and I still think that some kind of reor
ganization of student activities is necessary.
Some groups need to accumulate reserves, but
most student groups seem content to store ex
cess cash in the bank forever, preparing for an
Armageddon that will likely never come. Be
sides, student fees are $143 a quarter; SAFE Re
form would cut that figure by about 10 percent,
but that's still a fairly large sum.
And yet, what we, both as individuals and as a
community, get from our student groups is worth
far more than $143 per quarter. Stanford is
blessed with a vibrant set of opportunities, and

student largesse makes that possible. The student
body recognizes this. Stanford is a calmer place
than it was 40 years ago because we see an emerg
ing sense of consensus on the Farm. To be sure,
part of me does yearn for the time when ASSU
elections were major referenda on the principles
underlying the very nature of student life at Stan
ford. But that is nostalgia for nostalgia's sake.
If you're looking for a taste of some time-hon
ored college campus controversy, Stanford might
be a little boring. The Daily is an independent
newspaper that doesn't get searched anymore,
even if that is because we don't have any poten
tially violent events to cover. The Black Student
Union is not hosting sit-ins across campus, and
even though we like to say that the Admissions
Office is probably more controversial than it ever
has been, it really isn't.
For those of you who think the ASSU election
or the SAFE controversy were major, I must re
mind you that they weren't. Forty years ago, the
ASSU and student groups at Stanford faced the
kind of existential crisis that today's student
groups merely invoke for the sake of rhetoric.
For students to squabble over whether or not the
Stanford Flipside should get a Segway seems, in
comparison, positively minor. (They did. It's hon
estly a small price to pay for humor.) Some re
form of SAFE will eventually get passed, and the
Flipside will probably break their Segway and
successfully order a new one. We wouldn't want it
any other way.

Now that the Flipside has a Segway, Winston
Shi wants The Daily to get a golf cart. Convince
him, to upgrade to a Benz at wshi9k@
