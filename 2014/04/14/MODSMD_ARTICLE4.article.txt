## Research finds personal info in metadata Discovery suggests that NSA program can identify behavioral patterns 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
According to new research by two Stan
ford doctoral students, the National Security
Agency's (NSA) mass surveillance of tele
phone metadata could potentially reveal much
more detailed information about consumers'
private lives than what the federal govern
ment has claimed.
Based just on the phone records of 546 vol
unteers, Jonathan Mayer J.D. 'l2 Ph.D. 'l6
and Patrick Mutchler Ph.D. 'l6 were able to
draw a number of conclusions about those vol
unteers' activities based solely on the phone
metadata, which includes the phone number
of the caller and recipient, the serial numbers
of the phones involved, as well as the time, du
ration and potential location of each person
when the call occurred.
The concern about metadata has surged
since last summer's revelations about the
NSA's surveillance of Ameri
can citizens. Beginning in
September of last year, ac
cording to Mutchler, the two
researchers set out to find
out exactly how much could
be learned from the metada
ta that was the agency had
access to.
"What we wanted to do
was basically figure out ex
actly what you could learn
about someone, or at least a
lower bound of what you
could learn about someone
with this information,"
Mutchler said. "So we built
an app that allowed people to
volunteer their metadata to
us and basically had their
phone logs going back a cou
ple months."
Mayer and Mutchler
were able to draw a number
of facts from the volunteered
information by conducting
an analysis of individual calls
made by the volunteers.
Through the crowd
sourced data, it was deter
mined that 57 percent of the
volunteers made at least one
medical call and that 40 per
cent of the calls were related
to financial services.

"We were able to identify
a number of patterns that
were highly indicative of
sensitive activities or traits,"
Mayer said, offering an ex
ample of one participant that
had contacted several local
neurology groups, a special
ty pharmacy, a rare-condi
tion management service
and a pharmaceutical hotline

used for multiple sclerosis.
According to Mayer, the
research shows that metada
ta from phone calls can offer
a multitude of information
about family, political, pro
fessional, religious and even
sexual associations, among
other details.
However, the fact that
the researchers were able to
find out that much informa
tion wasn't a surprise, ac
cording to Mutchler. He
mentioned that neither of
them had reached out to
their participants about the
results of their research.
"We've adjusted our app
a bit to give them a little bit of
automated feedback about
what businesses and people
who were able to identify in
their call logs, but we haven't
actually asked the people
how they felt about these
things," Mutchler said.

"Though, if I were to guess,
they would all be upset be
cause the people that sign up
for our app tend to be people
that are very privacy-aware
and see the NSA as invading
their privacy, so I would
imagine that these particular
people would be very upset.
But I don't know if that nec
essarily that would general
ize to the [whole] popula
tion."
Regardless, the research
contributes to the public
knowledge about the poten
tial of phone metadata.
"I think that this have
and will continue to inform
people about the nature of
metadata and what it means
to collect data," said John
Mitchell, the researchers'
faculty advisor. "I think most
people have a sense that
showing your phone bill to
someone else might say

something about what your
issues were and what you
were actively lately con
cerned about, that you can
reasonably draw conclusions
[from the metadata]."
Mutchler also expressed
similar sentiments about
public opinion.
"The goal here really is
that if we're going to have a
national discussion about
this topic, it's very important
to have facts about it,"
Mutchler said. "This makes
it harder for people that are
trying to claim things that
are untrue sort of get
away with it and it also
makes it so that people are
more informed. They're able
to make the more informed
decisions about how they
feel about these programs."

Mutchler also expressed
similar sentiments about
public opinion.
"The goal here really is
that if we're going to have a
national discussion about
this topic, it's very important
to have facts about it,"
Mutchler said. "This makes
it harder for people that are
trying to claim things that
are untrue sort of get
away with it and it also
makes it so that people are
more informed. They're able
to make the more informed
decisions about how they
feel about these programs."

Stanford researchers Jonathan Mayer J.D. '12 Ph.D. '16 and Patrick Mutchler '16 were
able to draw conclusions about their volunteers' personal lives based on metadata.
According to new research by two Stan
ford doctoral students, the National Security
Agency's (NSA) mass surveillance of tele
phone metadata could potentially reveal much
more detailed information about consumers'
private lives than what the federal govern
ment has claimed.
Based just on the phone records of 546 vol
unteers, Jonathan Mayer J.D. 'l2 Ph.D. 'l6
and Patrick Mutchler Ph.D. 'l6 were able to
draw a number of conclusions about those vol
unteers' activities based solely on the phone
metadata, which includes the phone number
of the caller and recipient, the serial numbers
of the phones involved, as well as the time, du
ration and potential location of each person
when the call occurred.
The concern about metadata has surged
since last summer's revelations about the
NSA's surveillance of Ameri
can citizens. Beginning in
September of last year, ac
cording to Mutchler, the two
researchers set out to find
out exactly how much could
be learned from the metada
ta that was the agency had
access to.
"What we wanted to do
was basically figure out ex
actly what you could learn
about someone, or at least a
lower bound of what you
could learn about someone
with this information,"
Mutchler said. "So we built
an app that allowed people to
volunteer their metadata to
us and basically had their
phone logs going back a cou
ple months."
Mayer and Mutchler
were able to draw a number
of facts from the volunteered
information by conducting
an analysis of individual calls
made by the volunteers.
Through the crowd
sourced data, it was deter
mined that 57 percent of the
volunteers made at least one
medical call and that 40 per
cent of the calls were related
to financial services.

"We were able to identify
a number of patterns that
were highly indicative of
sensitive activities or traits,"
Mayer said, offering an ex
ample of one participant that
had contacted several local
neurology groups, a special
ty pharmacy, a rare-condi
tion management service
and a pharmaceutical hotline

used for multiple sclerosis.
According to Mayer, the
research shows that metada
ta from phone calls can offer
a multitude of information
about family, political, pro
fessional, religious and even
sexual associations, among
other details.
However, the fact that
the researchers were able to
find out that much informa
tion wasn't a surprise, ac
cording to Mutchler. He
mentioned that neither of
them had reached out to
their participants about the
results of their research.
"We've adjusted our app
a bit to give them a little bit of
automated feedback about
what businesses and people
who were able to identify in
their call logs, but we haven't
actually asked the people
how they felt about these
things," Mutchler said.

"Though, if I were to guess,
they would all be upset be
cause the people that sign up
for our app tend to be people
that are very privacy-aware
and see the NSA as invading
their privacy, so I would
imagine that these particular
people would be very upset.
But I don't know if that nec
essarily that would general
ize to the [whole] popula
tion."
Regardless, the research
contributes to the public
knowledge about the poten
tial of phone metadata.
"I think that this have
and will continue to inform
people about the nature of
metadata and what it means
to collect data," said John
Mitchell, the researchers'
faculty advisor. "I think most
people have a sense that
showing your phone bill to
someone else might say

something about what your
issues were and what you
were actively lately con
cerned about, that you can
reasonably draw conclusions
[from the metadata]."
Mutchler also expressed
similar sentiments about
public opinion.
"The goal here really is
that if we're going to have a
national discussion about
this topic, it's very important
to have facts about it,"
Mutchler said. "This makes
it harder for people that are
trying to claim things that
are untrue sort of get
away with it and it also
makes it so that people are
more informed. They're able
to make the more informed
decisions about how they
feel about these programs."
