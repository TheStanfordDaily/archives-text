# FOOTBALL SPRING GAME
## DEFENSIVE DOMINATION 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
It's a headline that Stanford Cardinal fans
around the country have become quite accus
tomed to: Stanford defense dominates oppos
ing offense. Unfortunately for Stanford, it
was its own offense that the defense was able
to stymie on Saturday at the annual Cardinal
& White Spring Game, as an experienced re
ceiving corps and a highly touted offensive
line weren't able to overcome a defense that
was lacking key contributors, with the offense
falling to the defense by a lopsided final score
of 47-23.
Although junior outside linebacker Kevin
Anderson who will start at the position
come the fall was injured at the team's fi
nal practice on Friday and didn't play at the
Spring Game, the defense weathered his loss
as well as the losses of sophomore cornerback
Alex Carter to injury and sophomore safety
Zach Hoffpauir to baseball, as it set the pace
early and dominated the first half of the
game.
"Defensively, we are so good up front,"
said head coach David Shaw. "We have a vet
eran group up front that's really, really tough
to run the ball against, really tough to pass
protect. We think we're going to have a good
offensive line, but it's hard to show that with
the guys that we have up front."
Freshman outside linebacker Peter
Kalambayi started in Anderson's place and
had a fantastic day, leading the team with sev
en tackles, including two sacks. His blitzing
was able to consistently power through Stan
ford's talented offensive line and he also

showed a consistent ability to
finish tackles. Kalambayi,
however, was still able to find
lots of room for improvement
within his performance.
"I did decently, but I can
get a lot better," Kalambayi
said. "I'm not the strongest
guy yet. [Junior outside line
backer James] Vaughters on
the other side is obviously a
lot stronger. Knowing my as
signment every single time
with no doubt we messed
it up a few times before I
fixed it."
Also impressive on the
defense was sophomore safe
ty Dallas Lloyd, who dis
played great physicality en
route to collecting 6 tackles
in his first action in Stanford
Stadium after converting
from quarterback. Lloyd
was effective both in tackling
at the line and in space, the
latter of which was demon
strated when he was able to
bring down sophomore run
ning back Barry Sanders as
the only man standing be
tween Sanders and the end
zone to limit a potential big
play.
On the other side of the
ball, Sanders was a major
contributor, as the highly an
ticipated sophomore led the

Cardinal's stable of three
primary backs with 12 car
ries for 68 yards. He dis
played the juking ability and
agility that many Stanford
fans are hoping will make
significant contributions to
the Cardinal's running game
in the upcoming seasons.
"I felt like I ran hard,
made some good cuts and
made people miss," Sanders
said. "There were a couple of
plays I felt like I missed a
couple of holes here and
there, but I felt like I did
well."

While Sanders was im
pressive at running back, the
position group took a further
hit for the spring when jun
ior Kelsey Young was slow to
get up after a play and left
the field favoring his right
arm, which was later seen in
a sling as Young stayed on
the sideline for the remain
der of the game. Shaw re
marked after the game that
Young had been in a signifi
cant amount of pain on the
field that subsided for the
most part once the running
back had made his way to
the sideline. Young will re
ceive X-rays to determine
the exact nature of the in
jury. This injury comes after
junior Remound Wright has
already been sitting out
spring practices due to a dis
ciplinary violation.
Saturday also offered
Stanford fans their first op

portunity to see freshman
quarterback Ryan Burns
take the helm of the offense.
Shaw had previously ex
pressed disappointment that
Burns had been unable to
take critical snaps with the
offense to gain experience
within the Cardinal's system
due to Burns' suspension for
the first session of spring,
and that inexperience
showed on Saturday. Burns
completed just 12 of his 25
passes for 131 yards, and
threw one interception that
was returned by freshman
cornei'back Chandler Dor
rell for a touchdown.
"He's learning the of
fense," Shaw said. "He's
learning what to do. He's
about on pace with every
freshman quarterback we've
had except for Andrew
[Luck 'l2], who was a bit
above, as you can imagine.
He's right where Kevin
Hogan was his freshman
year, right where all those
other guys were their fresh
men years."
Burns looked flustered in
the pocket at times and
made some questionable de
cisions, including pulling the
trigger on several passes
that could have been inter
cepted and further returned
for touchdowns. In addition,
he fumbled three snaps, an
indication that he still needs
time to adjust to taking
snaps under center after

predominantly having taken
snaps out of the shotgun
during high school.
Meanwhile, Hogan start
ed slowly but had an efficient
day overall, completing 14 of
his 22 pass attempts for 131
yards and two touchdowns.
He came out of the half look
ing much more comfortable
finding his receivers than he
had before the break. He led
two touchdown drives in the
third quarter: one capped by
a fade to sophomore tight
end Eric Cotton in the cor
ner of the end zone and an
other by a pass well-placed
for junior Devon Cajuste to
corral using his height to his
advantage.
The touchdown pass to
Cotton was promising for a
tight end group that had
been largely quiet in the
passing game last season but
will be looking to use the tal
ents of Cotton and fellow
freshmen Austin Hooper
and Greg Taboada to emerge
again as a viable passing tar
get.

The offense will now have
just over four months to gel
and work on its details be
fore the beginning of the
season, while the defense
will continue to consolidate
its position groupings and
adjust to life under a
changed coaching staff.

rell for a touchdown.
"He's learning the of
fense," Shaw said. "He's
learning what to do. He's
about on pace with every
freshman quarterback we've
had except for Andrew
[Luck 'l2], who was a bit
above, as you can imagine.
He's right where Kevin
Hogan was his freshman
year, right where all those
other guys were their fresh
men years."
Burns looked flustered in
the pocket at times and
made some questionable de
cisions, including pulling the
trigger on several passes
that could have been inter
cepted and further returned
for touchdowns. In addition,
he fumbled three snaps, an
indication that he still needs
time to adjust to taking
snaps under center after

predominantly having taken
snaps out of the shotgun
during high school.
Meanwhile, Hogan start
ed slowly but had an efficient
day overall, completing 14 of
his 22 pass attempts for 131
yards and two touchdowns.
He came out of the half look
ing much more comfortable
finding his receivers than he
had before the break. He led
two touchdown drives in the
third quarter: one capped by
a fade to sophomore tight
end Eric Cotton in the cor
ner of the end zone and an
other by a pass well-placed
for junior Devon Cajuste to
corral using his height to his
advantage.
The touchdown pass to
Cotton was promising for a
tight end group that had
been largely quiet in the
passing game last season but
will be looking to use the tal
ents of Cotton and fellow
freshmen Austin Hooper
and Greg Taboada to emerge
again as a viable passing tar
get.

The offense will now have
just over four months to gel
and work on its details be
fore the beginning of the
season, while the defense
will continue to consolidate
its position groupings and
adjust to life under a
changed coaching staff.

It's a headline that Stanford Cardinal fans
around the country have become quite accus
tomed to: Stanford defense dominates oppos
ing offense. Unfortunately for Stanford, it
was its own offense that the defense was able
to stymie on Saturday at the annual Cardinal
& White Spring Game, as an experienced re
ceiving corps and a highly touted offensive
line weren't able to overcome a defense that
was lacking key contributors, with the offense
falling to the defense by a lopsided final score
of 47-23.
Although junior outside linebacker Kevin
Anderson who will start at the position
come the fall was injured at the team's fi
nal practice on Friday and didn't play at the
Spring Game, the defense weathered his loss
as well as the losses of sophomore cornerback
Alex Carter to injury and sophomore safety
Zach Hoffpauir to baseball, as it set the pace
early and dominated the first half of the
game.
"Defensively, we are so good up front,"
said head coach David Shaw. "We have a vet
eran group up front that's really, really tough
to run the ball against, really tough to pass
protect. We think we're going to have a good
offensive line, but it's hard to show that with
the guys that we have up front."
Freshman outside linebacker Peter
Kalambayi started in Anderson's place and
had a fantastic day, leading the team with sev
en tackles, including two sacks. His blitzing
was able to consistently power through Stan
ford's talented offensive line and he also

at the Spring Game on Saturday. Stanford's tight end corps will look to expand its role in the team's passing game this coming season.
showed a consistent ability to
finish tackles. Kalambayi,
however, was still able to find
lots of room for improvement
within his performance.
"I did decently, but I can
get a lot better," Kalambayi
said. "I'm not the strongest
guy yet. [Junior outside line
backer James] Vaughters on
the other side is obviously a
lot stronger. Knowing my as
signment every single time
with no doubt we messed
it up a few times before I
fixed it."
Also impressive on the
defense was sophomore safe
ty Dallas Lloyd, who dis
played great physicality en
route to collecting 6 tackles
in his first action in Stanford
Stadium after converting
from quarterback. Lloyd
was effective both in tackling
at the line and in space, the
latter of which was demon
strated when he was able to
bring down sophomore run
ning back Barry Sanders as
the only man standing be
tween Sanders and the end
zone to limit a potential big
play.
On the other side of the
ball, Sanders was a major
contributor, as the highly an
ticipated sophomore led the

Cardinal's stable of three
primary backs with 12 car
ries for 68 yards. He dis
played the juking ability and
agility that many Stanford
fans are hoping will make
significant contributions to
the Cardinal's running game
in the upcoming seasons.
"I felt like I ran hard,
made some good cuts and
made people miss," Sanders
said. "There were a couple of
plays I felt like I missed a
couple of holes here and
there, but I felt like I did
well."

While Sanders was im
pressive at running back, the
position group took a further
hit for the spring when jun
ior Kelsey Young was slow to
get up after a play and left
the field favoring his right
arm, which was later seen in
a sling as Young stayed on
the sideline for the remain
der of the game. Shaw re
marked after the game that
Young had been in a signifi
cant amount of pain on the
field that subsided for the
most part once the running
back had made his way to
the sideline. Young will re
ceive X-rays to determine
the exact nature of the in
jury. This injury comes after
junior Remound Wright has
already been sitting out
spring practices due to a dis
ciplinary violation.
Saturday also offered
Stanford fans their first op

portunity to see freshman
quarterback Ryan Burns
take the helm of the offense.
Shaw had previously ex
pressed disappointment that
Burns had been unable to
take critical snaps with the
offense to gain experience
within the Cardinal's system
due to Burns' suspension for
the first session of spring,
and that inexperience
showed on Saturday. Burns
completed just 12 of his 25
passes for 131 yards, and
threw one interception that
was returned by freshman
cornei'back Chandler Dor
rell for a touchdown.
"He's learning the of
fense," Shaw said. "He's
learning what to do. He's
