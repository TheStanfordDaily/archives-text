## Student-athlete pay is not the right way 
### Joseph Beyda 
Last week, Stanford runner
and Daily sports editor
Cameron Miller wrote
that collegiate athletes are
being "used by an unjust
NCAA system," adding his voice to
the growing clamor that NCAA ad
ministrators are stuffing their pock
ets while student-athletes remain un
able to profit in the increasingly lu
crative world of college sports.
"Finally, at long last, the unfair
ness and inherent contradictions of
the NCAA's 'student-athlete' system
may slowly be starting to change," he
wrote, referencing the National La
bor Relations Board's decision in
March that Northwestern football
players have the right to unionize.
Cameron's point that student-ath
letes are often hung out to dry in the
modern-day NCAA holds water; as
he aptly mentioned, UConn basket
ball star' Shabazz Napier said recent
ly that he doesn't have enough food to
eat some nights. But even though
those disturbing implications of our
current system give us reason to re
think the ideals of amateurism to
which the NCAA has always clung so
tightly, the answer isn't to treat stu
dent-athletes as employees, allow
them to make money off their like
nesses or pay them salaries.
From what I've seen, most propo
nents of that approach argue that
NCAA administrators, especially
president Mark Emmert, are raking
in huge sums of cash from TV deals,
money that should instead be given to
the athletes whose abilities make
those deals possible.
Let's get this straight. Emmert
makes $1.7 million a year, and if we
were to dissolve his position tomor
row and split that money equally
amongst the 420,000 NCAA student
athletes for whom he is responsible, it
wouldn't be enough to buy Cameron
—or Napier, for that matter a
Five Dollar Footlong for lunch.
My co-editor was right to point
out the NCAAs staggering revenues
from rights agreements; the $433 mil
lion that entails (according to 2012
statistics) is more than $l,OOO per stu
dent-athlete. But at the same time, 60
percent of the $10.6 billion in total
revenue that the NCAA took in that
year that's $15,000 per student
athlete —went straight back to the
schools.
There, it funded the facilities that
allow for athletic training, the sports
information departments that make
TV broadcasts possible and many of
the scholarships that put student-ath
letes on college campuses in the first
place. And even including help from
the NCAA and its conferences to
taling $7 million for the median FBS
school the median total revenues
of those schools' athletic programs
fell $700,000 short of their median to
tal expenses.
My point is that the image of some
giant pot of gold sitting around at
NCAA headquarters or in athletic de
partments, being hidden from the
student-athletes that truly generated
it, is as misguided as the countervail
ing belief that everything is currently
okay with college athletics.
In the case that there isn't money
just floating around in the system, the
argument becomes, "Why not let stu
dent-athletes take to the free market,
profiting from their skills, likenesses
and autographs as they wish?"
The reason "why not" is simple.
Under such a system, the same in
come inequality that plagues our
country today would play out on a
smaller scale in collegiate athletics,
with the athletically rich institutions
and sports becoming richer and the
athletically poor ones becoming poor
er.
If I'm a high school football player
from poor roots but with a 2350 SAT
score, and I'm being recruited by
Stanford and Oklahoma, much of my
incentive to receive an elite college
education intended as the pinnacle
of the NCAAs education-first model
goes out the window when I know
I'll be able to feed my family with the
money I make signing autographs af
ter choosing the option that increases
my short-term exposure. How can
you blame me?
The problem is that I'll miss out
on the necessary life and job skills I
could've gained along the way at an
elite academic institution, and when
my football career likely flames out
after a brief NFL stint (if I'm lucky
enough to get that far), I'll be right
back where I started financially.
Meanwhile, a whole host of
