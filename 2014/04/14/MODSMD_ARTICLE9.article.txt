# SEATTLE SERIES SALVAGED
## Hochstatter's start secures Sunday win 
### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's baseball team had a tall task
ahead of it this past weekend as it traveled
to Seattle to take on the conference-lead
ing No. 9 Washington Huskies (24-7-1,12-
3 Pac-12). It was the Cardinal's (12-16,3-8)
sixth ranked opponent of the season
continuing one of the country's most diffi
cult schedules with the Huskies enter
ing the three-game set with a near-perfect
10-1 record at home.

Ultimately, the team's prolonged lack
of opportune offense as well as a couple of
regressing starts by its freshmen plagued
Stanford in the series, as the team
dropped the first two games 6-1 and 7-2
before salvaging Sunday's finale, 6-3. It
was the first time since 2010 that the Car
dinal dropped a series to Washington.
Almost everything that could have pos
sibly gone wrong for the Cardinal did on
Friday and everything went wrong on
Saturday. While the offense left 18 com
bined runners on base and hit just .133 (2-
for-15) with runners in scoring position in
the first two games of the series, fresh
man starting pitchers Brett Hanewich
and Cal Quantrill had among their worst
outings of the season.
Hanewich allowed a season-high five
runs and eight hits over 5.1 innings on Fri
day including four runs in the second in
ning. Quantrill was hit hard on Saturday
surrendering a season-high 11 hits and al
lowing five runs the most he's given up
since allowing six in his Feb. 21 start at
Texas over 5.2 innings.
Still, the offense didn't do the pitching
any favors. The saying, "when it rains, it
pours" couldn't fit the Stanford offense
any better, but an important caveat for the
team would be that when it doesn't rain,
there's a drought. In Stanford's 12 wins
this season, the offense has hit .289 and av-

Junior John Hochstatter (above), last year's customary Saturday starter, made his first start of the
