# SEATTLE SERIES SALVAGED
## Hochstatter's start secures Sunday win 
### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's baseball team had a tall task
ahead of it this past weekend as it traveled
to Seattle to take on the conference-lead
ing No. 9 Washington Huskies (24-7-1,12-
3 Pac-12). It was the Cardinal's (12-16,3-8)
sixth ranked opponent of the season
continuing one of the country's most diffi
cult schedules with the Huskies enter
ing the three-game set with a near-perfect
10-1 record at home.

Ultimately, the team's prolonged lack
of opportune offense as well as a couple of
regressing starts by its freshmen plagued
Stanford in the series, as the team
dropped the first two games 6-1 and 7-2
before salvaging Sunday's finale, 6-3. It
was the first time since 2010 that the Car
dinal dropped a series to Washington.
Almost everything that could have pos
sibly gone wrong for the Cardinal did on
Friday and everything went wrong on
Saturday. While the offense left 18 com
bined runners on base and hit just .133 (2-
for-15) with runners in scoring position in
the first two games of the series, fresh
man starting pitchers Brett Hanewich
and Cal Quantrill had among their worst
outings of the season.
Hanewich allowed a season-high five
runs and eight hits over 5.1 innings on Fri
day including four runs in the second in
ning. Quantrill was hit hard on Saturday
surrendering a season-high 11 hits and al
lowing five runs the most he's given up
since allowing six in his Feb. 21 start at
Texas over 5.2 innings.
Still, the offense didn't do the pitching
any favors. The saying, "when it rains, it
pours" couldn't fit the Stanford offense
any better, but an important caveat for the
team would be that when it doesn't rain,
there's a drought. In Stanford's 12 wins
this season, the offense has hit .289 and av-

Junior John Hochstatter (above), last year's customary Saturday starter, made his first start of the
2014 season on Sunday. He earned a win after allowing three runs over seven innings pitched.
eraged 6.8 runs per game. But in
its 16 losses, the offense has hit
.214 with a measly 1.6 runs per
game average, clearly illustrating
that a vast majority of the team's
runs have come in its blowout wins.
Junior John Hochstatter got
the start and the win on Sunday af
ternoon, ending the team's streak
of starting 27 consecutive fresh
man pitchers to begin its season.
Hochstatter, who went 3-3 with a
3.88 ERA in 2013 as the Cardinal's
customary Saturday starter, over
took freshman Chris Viall's spot in
the starting rotation after throwing
6.2 scoreless innings in his relief
last Sunday at Oregon State.
Almost a year to the day of his
only career complete game, which
also happened to be against Wash
ington, Hochstatter likely further
cemented his role as a starter
moving forward. He earned the
win after allowing just three runs
over seven innings and striking out
seven.

"Hochstatter pitched another
great game for us. He pitched
great in relief last week at Oregon
State and also at the Oregon game,
so we started him today and he
gave us some good innings," said
head coach Mark Marquess.
Before he even reached the
mound, he was treated to a 4-0
cushion, as the Cardinal offense ex
ploded against Washington starter
junior Jeff Brigham in the first in
ning. The Stanford hitters came
out with an aggressive approach,
attacking early in the count, and as
a result, each of the team's first
four hits came on the first pitches
of at-bats. Junior Austin Slater's
two-run single and senior Brant
Whiting's two-run double provided
the scoring in the inning.
Stanford added two runs in the
third inning to extend its lead to 6-
0, which it did not relinquish for the
rest of the game.
"To get six runs in the first
three innings was good," Marquess
said. "It was a good win for us.
We've been struggling with getting
guys in so we finally scored some
runs."

Sophomore two-sport athlete
Zach Hoffpauir has excelled at the

plate of late, as he has tallied seven
multi-hit performances over the
last 10 games and has brought his
season batting average up to .297.
He is also slugging .484 on the sea
son, second on the team behind
junior Alex Blandino.
Senior A.J. Vanegas relieved
Hochstatter in the eighth and
threw two scoreless innings to
close out the game and earn a save.
Since working his way back from a
back injury and making his 2014
debut 10 games into the season,
Vanegas has been lights-out out of
the bullpen, having yet to allow an
earned run over 16 innings in eight
appearances in which he has struck
out 12.
Stanford now heads home for a
two-week stretch in the Bay Area,
during which it will host seven of its
next eight games at Sunken Dia
mond. The Cardinal have a quick
turnaround and not a lot of rest
this week, as they are set to play
St. Mary's on Tuesday at 5:30 p.m.
before welcoming Arizona State for
a three-game set starting Thurs
day.
