## WNBA Draft reveals gender disparity 
### Ashley Westhem 
So I guess I don't have to
steal the John R. Wooden
Award away from anyone
as I promised I would,
since Chiney Ogwumike
did win National Player of the Year
as she rightly should have. And no one
stole the first overall WNBA draft
pick to the Connecticut Sun away
from her either, so Chiney got the per
fect ending to her collegiate basket
ball career and the perfect start to her
professional career.
Although it was unclear whether
Chiney would be picked first over
Baylor's Odyssey Sims, it was always
expected that they would be the first
and second picks which did come to
fruition. However, what many might
not have been able to say with certain
ty was when or if Mikaela Ruef would
be drafted. I found out in the middle of
writing this column that Mikaela was
chosen and pretty much got goose
bumps from the amount of Stanford
pride I felt.

To be able to say that I know three
people in the WNBA next season (in
cluding Chiney's older sister Nneka,
who was picked first overall two sea
sons ago by the LA Sparks) is just so
cool, for lack of a better word. But what
is also cool is the coverage that the
WNBA Draft now receives and the ad
vancement of professional women's
sports over the past few years.
The WNBA Draft was televised on
ESPN2 during primetime for the sec
ond straight year; even though the
league is entering its 18th season. Al
though the WNBA will most likely not
reach the notability or business model
of the NBA, it's at least encouraging to
see that the WNBA Draft is treated
just the same as the NBA Draft. The
women have worked just as hard in
their collegiate careers as the men and
deserve the same kind of recognition,
with all of the pomp and circumstance
and primetime coverage that the men
get.
Last year I took a class called Gen
der and Spoils, in which I studied the
ways in which funding for female ath
letics and the media's coverage of fe
male sports is far from equal to that of
their male counterparts. Quantity does
not necessarily equate to quality of cov
erage. So I was glad that when I
Googled today "how to watch the WN
BA Draft," I discovered that I could
watch it on an actual television and not
have to stream it from ESPN's web
site.
Because let's be honest, I just want
ed to see Chiney get picked first over
all on the big screen at my house and
not have to watch her on my computer.
It's bittersweet to think that I will no
longer get to see her in cardinal and
white, and that the next time I watch
her play will not be courtside at Maples
but on a television on the opposite side
of the country from her.
I won't have the privilege of being
the beat writer assigned to cover her
team and her gamesâ€”though she will
most certainly be featured in a column
or two during her rookie season.
I actually got to meet one of the
beat writers for the Connecticut Sun
last weekend while in Nashville at the
Final Four. He sought me out because
he wanted to pick my brain about
Chiney and what she's like off the
court. I told him that her personality
was perfectly captured in the "N-E-R-
D-S #nerdanthem" video that she
starred in and wrote the lyrics for, and
that the genuine and professional per
sona that she conveys to the media is
representative of her maturity and not
just a means of pleasing the media. It
was fun to brag about the awesome
person Chiney is off of the court.
And when he ended up writing a
Dr. Seuss-esque poem in his column
about Nerd Nation and Chiney's fit
with the Sun, I figured then and there
that he could handle covering someone
as unique and special on and off the
court as Chiney Ogwumike.

Ashley Westhem fainted when
Chiney was picked first by the Con
necticut Sun. To wish her a speedy
recovery and send her Gatoradefor
rehydration, contact her at awest
hem@stanford.edu and Tweet her
@ashwest!6.

Quantity does not
necessarily equate to
quality of coverage.
