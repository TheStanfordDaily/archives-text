# WILSON UPS THE ANTE
## Cameron Wilson and Patrick Rodgers finish on top as Card cruise 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
As evidenced by last week's
Masters, putting is not a simple
point-and-shoot exercise, especially
on Alister MacKenzie courses.
MacKenzie's greens like those
at Augusta National and those on
which Stanford men's golf team
played at Pasatiempo on Saturday

and Sunday require an intimate
knowledge of slope, speed and hole
location, and even then the ball
may inexplicably stop short or
barely miss the lip of the cup.
Though frustration on the putting
surface was unavoidable, Conrad
Ray's squad still managed perhaps
its best performance of the season
in its regular season finale.
Led by tournament winner
Cameron Wilson and runner-up
Patrick Rodgers, the Cardinal won
the Western Intercollegiate by six
teen strokes for its third team vic
tory in five spring events. Stanford
was near the top of the team

leaderboai'd throughout the week
end, never falling lower than a tie
for second. That type of consisten
cy of play over multiple rounds and
days is sure to benefit the Card at
them upcoming conference tourna
ment.
Saturday morning's first round,
which began at 8:30 a.m., offered
solid starts from Stanford's two
veteran frontrunners Rodgers,
a junior, and Wilson, a senior
who logged 5-under 65 and 3-under
67 scores respectively. Sophomore
David Boote carded four birdies
and four bogeys to come in at even
par 70, with freshmen Maverick

McNealy (+1) and Viraat Badhwar
(+4) rounding out the opening
frame. At that point, the team sat in
a tie for second with Washington,
behind archrival and 2013 NCAA
runner-up California by two shots.
There was no rest for the weary,
however, and the Cardinal hit the
Pasatiempo course again in the af
ternoon with the day's second
round starting at 1:30 p.m. This
time, the low man was Wilson, who
replicated his 3-under performance
from the morning with the help of
an eagle on the par-5, 502-yard

Senior Cameron Wilson (above) bested fellow teammate Patrick Rodgers by birdieing the final two holes to take home his first outright
collegiate victory. Stanford would win by 16 strokes, continuing a recent hot streak that includes three wins in its last five events.
