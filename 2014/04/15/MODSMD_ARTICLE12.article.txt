# WILSON UPS THE ANTE
## Cameron Wilson and Patrick Rodgers finish on top as Card cruise 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
As evidenced by last week's
Masters, putting is not a simple
point-and-shoot exercise, especially
on Alister MacKenzie courses.
MacKenzie's greens like those
at Augusta National and those on
which Stanford men's golf team
played at Pasatiempo on Saturday

and Sunday require an intimate
knowledge of slope, speed and hole
location, and even then the ball
may inexplicably stop short or
barely miss the lip of the cup.
Though frustration on the putting
surface was unavoidable, Conrad
Ray's squad still managed perhaps
its best performance of the season
in its regular season finale.
Led by tournament winner
Cameron Wilson and runner-up
Patrick Rodgers, the Cardinal won
the Western Intercollegiate by six
teen strokes for its third team vic
tory in five spring events. Stanford
was near the top of the team

leaderboai'd throughout the week
end, never falling lower than a tie
for second. That type of consisten
cy of play over multiple rounds and
days is sure to benefit the Card at
them upcoming conference tourna
ment.
Saturday morning's first round,
which began at 8:30 a.m., offered
solid starts from Stanford's two
veteran frontrunners Rodgers,
a junior, and Wilson, a senior
who logged 5-under 65 and 3-under
67 scores respectively. Sophomore
David Boote carded four birdies
and four bogeys to come in at even
par 70, with freshmen Maverick

McNealy (+1) and Viraat Badhwar
(+4) rounding out the opening
frame. At that point, the team sat in
a tie for second with Washington,
behind archrival and 2013 NCAA
runner-up California by two shots.
There was no rest for the weary,
however, and the Cardinal hit the
Pasatiempo course again in the af
ternoon with the day's second
round starting at 1:30 p.m. This
time, the low man was Wilson, who
replicated his 3-under performance
from the morning with the help of
an eagle on the par-5, 502-yard

ninth hole. McNealy, who has come
on strong for Stanford during its
past two contests, also snuck into
the red courtesy of a 1-under 69
that included birdies on the par-4
14th and 17th holes. Rodgers shot
1-under after an unremarkable but
nonetheless impressive round in
which he carded 15 pars. Freshman
Jim Liu recorded a 3-over 73, re
bounding nicely from an awful
morning that saw him post a triple
bogey on the par-4 second and a
quadruple-bogey on seven.
When the dust settled following
the whirlwind first day, the Card
enjoyed a six-stroke advantage
over the Huskies and were eight
shots clear of Cal, with both teams
failing to keep pace with Stanford
during the second 18. Rodgers and
Wilson, who were tied for first at 6-
under in the individual race, but
tressed the team's position atop the
standings.
On Sunday, the squad continued
its very encouraging trend of sav
ing its best round for last, firing the

lowest cumulative round of the
tournament with a 6-under 344.
The only team to shoot under par
for the third round, Stanford's
strong finish was spearheaded by
its young guns Liu and McNealy,
both of whom notched 3-under 675.
The real drama, though, came
from the Rodgers-Wilson group,
which also included 36-hole co
leader Trevor Simsby of Washing
ton. All three were 1-under as they
made the turn for home, but Sims
by's double-bogey on the par-4
11th doomed his chances. After the
15th hole, Rodgers was two up on
his teammate and on the verge of
his fourth consecutive collegiate
event victory. But he bogeyed three
of his last four, and Wilson capital
ized by birdieing 17 and 18 to earn
the first outright collegiate win of
his career.
"Patrick and Cameron both
played well," head coach Conrad
Ray '97 said of his players' final
round. "It was one of those days
where nothing came easy, so it was
back-and-forth and they were pret
ty much tied all day. And then it
came down to 17 where Cameron
chipped in for birdie as well as
birdieing 18, and Patrick was un
able to get up-and-down on 18 and

made a bogey. It was well-fought on
all sides, and I know it was a bit
tough for them as they were cheer
ing for each other but also compet
ing against each other for the indi
vidual title."
"This was a big win for me,"
Wilson remarked. "I've been in
contention a lot this year and
haven't played poorly but haven't
played well at the end of the final
rounds. To do that this week felt
great."
Ray also brought along sopho
more Dominick Francks and junior
Patrick Grimes to compete as indi
viduals, and may have found some
thing in the former. Francks, play
ing in only his fourth tournament
all season, would have factored into
the Card's scoring with rounds of
70-71-74. Considering that the Pac
-12 Championship employs a play
six-count-five model, fans should
not be surprised if Ray inserts the
seldom-used second-year man into
the lineup.
The Cardinal will be off for an
other ten days before heading
south to Marana, Ariz., for the Pac
-12 Men's Golf Championships.

(+4) rounding out the opening

a tie for second with Washington,
behind archrival and 2013 NCAA
runner-up California by two shots.
There was no rest for the weary,
however, and the Cardinal hit the
Pasatiempo course again in the af
ternoon with the day's second
round starting at 1:30 p.m. This
time, the low man was Wilson, who

from the morning with the help of

ninth hole. McNealy, who has come
on strong for Stanford during its
past two contests, also snuck into
the red courtesy of a 1-under 69
that included birdies on the par-4
14th and 17th holes. Rodgers shot
1-under after an unremarkable but
nonetheless impressive round in
which he carded 15 pars. Freshman
Jim Liu recorded a 3-over 73, re
bounding nicely from an awful
morning that saw him post a triple
bogey on the par-4 second and a
quadruple-bogey on seven.
When the dust settled following
the whirlwind first day, the Card
enjoyed a six-stroke advantage
over the Huskies and were eight
shots clear of Cal, with both teams
failing to keep pace with Stanford
during the second 18. Rodgers and
Wilson, who were tied for first at 6-
under in the individual race, but
tressed the team's position atop the
standings.
On Sunday, the squad continued
its very encouraging trend of sav
ing its best round for last, firing the

lowest cumulative round of the
tournament with a 6-under 344.
The only team to shoot under par
for the third round, Stanford's
strong finish was spearheaded by
its young guns Liu and McNealy,
both of whom notched 3-under 675.
The real drama, though, came
from the Rodgers-Wilson group,
which also included 36-hole co
leader Trevor Simsby of Washing
ton. All three were 1-under as they
made the turn for home, but Sims
by's double-bogey on the par-4
11th doomed his chances. After the
15th hole, Rodgers was two up on
his teammate and on the verge of
his fourth consecutive collegiate
event victory. But he bogeyed three
of his last four, and Wilson capital
ized by birdieing 17 and 18 to earn
the first outright collegiate win of
his career.
"Patrick and Cameron both
played well," head coach Conrad
Ray '97 said of his players' final
round. "It was one of those days
where nothing came easy, so it was
back-and-forth and they were pret
ty much tied all day. And then it
came down to 17 where Cameron
chipped in for birdie as well as
birdieing 18, and Patrick was un
able to get up-and-down on 18 and

made a bogey. It was well-fought on
all sides, and I know it was a bit
tough for them as they were cheer
ing for each other but also compet
ing against each other for the indi
vidual title."
"This was a big win for me,"
Wilson remarked. "I've been in
contention a lot this year and
haven't played poorly but haven't
played well at the end of the final
rounds. To do that this week felt
great."
Ray also brought along sopho
more Dominick Francks and junior
Patrick Grimes to compete as indi
viduals, and may have found some
thing in the former. Francks, play
ing in only his fourth tournament
all season, would have factored into
the Card's scoring with rounds of
70-71-74. Considering that the Pac
-12 Championship employs a play
six-count-five model, fans should
not be surprised if Ray inserts the
seldom-used second-year man into
the lineup.
The Cardinal will be off for an
other ten days before heading
south to Marana, Ariz., for the Pac
-12 Men's Golf Championships.

As evidenced by last week's
Masters, putting is not a simple
point-and-shoot exercise, especially
on Alister MacKenzie courses.
MacKenzie's greens like those
at Augusta National and those on
which Stanford men's golf team
played at Pasatiempo on Saturday

and Sunday require an intimate
knowledge of slope, speed and hole
location, and even then the ball
may inexplicably stop short or
barely miss the lip of the cup.
Though frustration on the putting
surface was unavoidable, Conrad
Ray's squad still managed perhaps
its best performance of the season
in its regular season finale.
Led by tournament winner
Cameron Wilson and runner-up
Patrick Rodgers, the Cardinal won
the Western Intercollegiate by six
teen strokes for its third team vic
tory in five spring events. Stanford
was near the top of the team

leaderboai'd throughout the week
end, never falling lower than a tie
for second. That type of consisten
cy of play over multiple rounds and
days is sure to benefit the Card at
them upcoming conference tourna
ment.
Saturday morning's first round,
which began at 8:30 a.m., offered
solid starts from Stanford's two
veteran frontrunners Rodgers,
a junior, and Wilson, a senior
who logged 5-under 65 and 3-under
67 scores respectively. Sophomore
David Boote carded four birdies
and four bogeys to come in at even
par 70, with freshmen Maverick

McNealy (+1) and Viraat Badhwar
(+4) rounding out the opening
frame. At that point, the team sat in
a tie for second with Washington,
