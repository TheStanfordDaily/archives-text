# Young squad hoping to follow predecessors

There's an old saying
that says "Go West,
young man." On Fri
day, I decided to ignore
these words of wisdom
and head east on campus, towards
Taube Family Tennis Stadium,
where the Stanford men's tennis
team was set to take on the Wash
ington Huskies in a late-season Pac
-12 match.
For someone like me who
peaked in the USTA 14-and-under
division after making the crucial re

alization that the goal was to keep
the ball in the court as opposed to
hitting it over the fence, I have al
ways had an appreciation for the
grace with which collegiate tennis
players play the game. And for
someone who was looking to watch
great college tennis, what better
school to attend than Stanford?
For those of you who haven't
gotten the chance, I encourage you
to take a trip to the tennis stadium.
Outside, you'll find more plaques
than palm trees on Palm Drive, enu
merating the 34 combined (17 each)
NCAA Division I national champi
onships that the men's and women's
teams have won.
If you further peruse the NCAA
history books, you'll find that 14
Stanford men's players have also
won the NCAA singles champi
onships and 14 Stanford pairs have

won the NCAA doubles champi
onships. Keep reading the history
books, and you'll see that seven
Stanford players including cur
rent head coach John Whitlinger
have won both the singles and dou
bles championships.
The bottom line is that the often
overused word "dynasty" (sorry,
Miami Heat fans) is probably an un
derstatement for the Stanford
men's tennis program. Players such
as John McEnroe, Sandy and Gene
Mayer, Roscoe Tanner and Tim
Mayotte (all former top-15 singles
players in the world) have donned
the cardinal and white, and that in
credible list does not even include
doubles phenoms like the Bryan
Brothers, Jim Grabb, Alex O'Brien,
Jonathan Stark and Jared Palmer

Bradley Klahn and Ryan Thacher (above) took Stanford to the NCAA quarterfinals as recently as two years
ago. Today's Cardinal team hopes to replicate the successes Stanford achieved under their leadership.
