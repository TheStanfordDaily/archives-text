# Young squad hoping to follow predecessors
## 
### Shawn Tuteja 
There's an old saying
that says "Go West,
young man." On Fri
day, I decided to ignore
these words of wisdom
and head east on campus, towards
Taube Family Tennis Stadium,
where the Stanford men's tennis
team was set to take on the Wash
ington Huskies in a late-season Pac
-12 match.
For someone like me who
peaked in the USTA 14-and-under
division after making the crucial re

alization that the goal was to keep
the ball in the court as opposed to
hitting it over the fence, I have al
ways had an appreciation for the
grace with which collegiate tennis
players play the game. And for
someone who was looking to watch
great college tennis, what better
school to attend than Stanford?
For those of you who haven't
gotten the chance, I encourage you
to take a trip to the tennis stadium.
Outside, you'll find more plaques
than palm trees on Palm Drive, enu
merating the 34 combined (17 each)
NCAA Division I national champi
onships that the men's and women's
teams have won.
If you further peruse the NCAA
history books, you'll find that 14
Stanford men's players have also
won the NCAA singles champi
onships and 14 Stanford pairs have

won the NCAA doubles champi
onships. Keep reading the history
books, and you'll see that seven
Stanford players including cur
rent head coach John Whitlinger
have won both the singles and dou
bles championships.
The bottom line is that the often
overused word "dynasty" (sorry,
Miami Heat fans) is probably an un
derstatement for the Stanford
men's tennis program. Players such
as John McEnroe, Sandy and Gene
Mayer, Roscoe Tanner and Tim
Mayotte (all former top-15 singles
players in the world) have donned
the cardinal and white, and that in
credible list does not even include
doubles phenoms like the Bryan
Brothers, Jim Grabb, Alex O'Brien,
Jonathan Stark and Jared Palmer

Bradley Klahn and Ryan Thacher (above) took Stanford to the NCAA quarterfinals as recently as two years
ago. Today's Cardinal team hopes to replicate the successes Stanford achieved under their leadership.
all of whom have been ranked
number one in the world in doubles.
The only downside to having this
type of program history is that when
the going gets tough, it causes peo
ple to sometimes irrationally rush to
exaggerated reactions. It's not un
common to hear fans asking ques
tions like, "How did this happen?" or,
"Are we ever going to have an 'elite'
program again?"
It seems that questions such as
these are now surrounding the
men's tennis program at Stanford.
Last year, the team finished an un
characteristic 12-12, which included
losing in the first round of the
NCAA tournament to No. 20 LSU.
Despite their impressive 12-4
record this season, the team is only
ranked 43rd (although this ranking
is sure to go up in the ITA rankings
following Stanford's consecutive
wins over Washington and No. 39
Oregon). Thus, the question that I
pondered while sitting at Taube
Family Tennis Stadium on Friday
was "What is the future of the men's
tennis team?"
First, keep in mind that it was
just two seasons ago that Stanford
reached the NCAA Quarterfinals
under the senior leadership of the
dynamic duo of Bradley Klahn and
Ryan Thacher.
To get some perspective on just
how big the loss of these two stars
was to the program, consider the
fact that Klahn was the NCAA sin

gles champion as a sophomore and is
now the second highest-ranked
American in the world. Thacher
posted a 94-46 singles record during
his time on the Farm, and he com
bined with Klahn to capture back-to
back Pacific Coast Doubles champi
onships (something that had not
been done since the 1990-1991 sea
son).
"It's tough. Klahn is an NCAA
champion; Ryan was a three-time
Kalamazoo [the nation's top junior
tennis tournament] finalist,"
Whitlinger said. "It's never easy."
Last season, it was clear that the
team felt the effects of youth and the
loss of its top two players. John Mor
risey found himself vaulted from the
number four to the number one sin
gles court in just a year, and fresh
men such as Nolan Paige, Maciek
Romanowicz and Trey Strobel found
themselves playing in meaningful
singles matches in only their first
years.
Who wouldn't expect there to be
an adjustment period? Was it really
reasonable to expect the team to fill
the shoes of two of the best colle
giate tennis players of the decade
without even the slightest hiccup?
The fact that the team made the
NCAA tournament last year was a
testament to the coaching staff and
player development that happens at
Stanford. Considering that the norm
in tennis is for the top junior players
to either leave college early to turn
pro or skip college altogether, it real
ly says something about this staff
that a player like Klahn, who
achieved the ultimate accolade as a
sophomore, would return for two
more years of collegiate tennis. Why

should we be skeptical at all, then, of
whether this same coaching staff will
have Stanford competing for nation
al championships again in the very
near future?
This season, Stanford started off
4-2, with losses to No. 3 Georgia and
No. 9 California. Moreover, what's
not included in this 4-2 record is that
Stanford's Feb. 9 match against No.
2 UCLA was officially scored as
"rained out," despite the fact that
the Cardinal had won the doubles
point and four first sets out of the six
singles courts.
How easy would it have been for
this team to throw in the towel back
in February?
Every excuse was on their side.
Nolan Paige, one of the key fresh
man contributors from the previous
season, was ill all winter quarter, and
the match that was supposed to be
Stanford's "big win" was rained out
at the most inopportune moment for
the Cardinal. What's more is that
the Cardinal were staring down a
spring break schedule that featured
matches in Las Vegas, Salt Lake
City and Iticson in the span of five
days.
Nonetheless, in three closely con
tested matches, the Stanford Cardi
nal prevailed against all three oppo
nents 4-3, and at the start of April,
the Cardinal found itself back in the
rankings at No. 52 following what
Whitlinger called "one of the tough
est road trips that we've ever had."
However, just two days after ar
riving back on the Farm from Tuc
son, the team faced its biggest chal
lenge since in over a month against
No. 22 Boise State.
Surely this was the moment

where the team would finally falter,
right? How could we expect an ex
ceptionally young team on two days
rest after having won three straight
matches 4-3 on the road to beat a
top-25 team?
As you might know, Stanford dis
missed Boise State 4-0, featuring a
singles lineup with three sopho
mores, two juniors, and one senior.
Just like that, the winning streak
reached six matches in a row. After a
tough trip down to Southern Califor
nia which saw Stanford lose to No. 3
USC (who won four consecutive na
tional championships from 2008-12)
and No. 2 UCLA (last year's NCAA
runner-up), the Cardinal were back
in action last Friday against Wash
ington, which brings me full circle
to the start of this article.
I can honestly say that Friday's
home match against Washington
was the most exciting collegiate
match that I've ever seen. Stanford
found itself in a familiar situation,
with the match tied at 3-3. This
time, the match fell into the racket
of sophomore Anthony Tsodikov at
number five singles. Tsodikov, who
wasn't even a part of the lineup his
freshman year, played the role of
hero in fighting off multiple match
points to prevail 15-13 in a third-set
tiebreaker.
"Being from San Francisco, it's
always been a dream of mine to play
for Stanford," Tsodikov said after
the match. "When you're a kid, you
always look forward to when the
match is 3-3 and you're playing to
win for the team it's like in the
movies."
I'll never forget watching the en
tire team storm the court to cele

brate with Tsodikov. Around me,
fans were smiling, hugging and
high-fiving. It was as if men's tennis
was back with a vengeance after a
short hiatus, and the team we saw
pull off this incredible victory was
growing up before our eyes. A new
identity was forming, and as
Tsodikov would say after the match,
"We had big shoes to fill, and hope
fully we're getting there."
The very next day, Stanford fol
lowed up its thrilling victory against
Washington by taking down No. 39
Oregon, continuing to build on its
new identity.
"Klahn and Thacher were spe
cial," Whitlinger said. "So were Bob
and Mike Bryan, and so were a lot
of the players that we've had. [But
moving forward, new] guys step up.
They improve, and they do better."
This isn't the first time that
Stanford has lost great players, and
it will certainly not be the last. Play
ers, including those who will join
the team next year as part of the
nation's top recruiting class, will
continue to grow and thrive under
the Stanford system.
This season, we're seeing the be
ginning of a new chapter in a book
filled with greatness.
I, for one, cannot wait to see how
this chapter will end.

Shawn Tuteja's hopes and, dreams

ketball fell to Dayton in the NCAA
Tournament and, he immediately
sought solace in the, men's tennis
team. To tell Shawn why men's ten
