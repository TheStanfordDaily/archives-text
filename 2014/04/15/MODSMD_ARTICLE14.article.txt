## PERFECT ON THE ROAD Stanford sweeps final road games 
### FIONA NOONAN STAFF WRITER 
The No. 7 Stanford women's
tennis team (16-1, 8-1 Pac-12)
stayed perfect on the road as
they swept past Oregon (7-12,1-
7 Pac-12) and No. 47 Washington
State (17-10, 2-7 Pac-12) for
their final away matches of the
season this past weekend.

The weekend began in Eu
gene on Friday, where the No. 7
Cardinal snagged their 10th
shutout of the season against the
Ducks. After a rainy winter and
early spring, it was just the first
time this year that Oregon had
played on its outdoor courts. The
outdoor opener was sour for the
Ducks, as Stanford quickly leapt
out to a 4-0 lead for an overall
victory, ending the other match
es in progress.

Stanford's lineup was signifi
cantly different Friday, with No.
4 senior Kristie Ahn, who nor
mally plays on court one for the
Cardinal, sitting out. Senior
Amelia Herring stepped into her
place with freshman Carol Zhao
on the number two doubles
court, while sophomore Lindsey
Kostas filled the sixth spot in the

singles lineup in place of Ahn.
The Cardinal won every match
in straight sets against the Ducks,
and would have been poised to win
all seven if the teams had not
ceased play at four. After taking the
doubles point, No. 41 Doyle started
off the singles wins on court num
ber five. She was followed by No. 22
Zhao's win on court two, and No. 28
freshman Taylor Davidson's 6-0, 6-
2 victory on court three to finish the
day.
The following day found Stan
ford in Pullman, Wash., to face
Washington State for the Cardi
nal's final road match of the season.
They stayed perfect in Pullman,
beating the Cougars 4-0 overall for
their 11th shutout of the year.
Though the matches moved in
doors during the second sets, the
Cardinal pushed past the Cougars
with ease. During doubles play, the
team dropped just three games be
tween its two winning pairs to go up
1-0 against the Cougars. Ahn was
back at her regular number one
doubles spot with Zhao, though the
pair did not complete their match
before doubles play ended.
On the singles courts, Saturday
was much the same as Friday. No.

47 sophomore Krista Hardebeck
secured the first win, followed by
Davidson on court three and Zhao
on court two to clinch the match.
Kostas remained in the lineup
once more and led WSU's Dajana
Ognejenovic 6-0,2-3 at the time the
match stopped.
The freshmen also continued to
display their dominance this week
end. Together, the three have lost
just 11 singles matches all year.
WSU faced a particularly tough
slate this weekend, as it began with
a 0-4 loss to No. 6 California at 9
a.m. before facing the Cardinal for
a repeat result at 2 p.m. later that
same day.
Stanford has just one game re
maining this season against Cal,
who currently holds the lead in the
Pac-12 standings. The Cardinal al
ready took down the Bears 5-2 ear
lier this season in Berkeley, but Cal
has been on a hot streak after beat
ing both No. 2 UCLA and No. 13
USC a few weekends ago. The win
ner of next Saturday's Stanford-
Cal dual match will almost certain
ly win the regular season Pac-12 ti
tle before the conference tourna
ment starts on April 24.
The Cardinal face off against
the Golden Bears on Saturday at
the Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
The match will begin at noon.

Though the matches moved in
doors during the second sets, the
Cardinal pushed past the Cougars
with ease. During doubles play, the
team dropped just three games be
tween its two winning pairs to go up
1-0 against the Cougars. Ahn was
back at her regular number one
doubles spot with Zhao, though the
pair did not complete their match
before doubles play ended.
On the singles courts, Saturday
was much the same as Friday. No.

47 sophomore Krista Hardebeck
secured the first win, followed by
Davidson on court three and Zhao
on court two to clinch the match.
Kostas remained in the lineup
once more and led WSU's Dajana
Ognejenovic 6-0,2-3 at the time the
match stopped.
The freshmen also continued to
display their dominance this week
end. Together, the three have lost
just 11 singles matches all year.
WSU faced a particularly tough
slate this weekend, as it began with
a 0-4 loss to No. 6 California at 9
a.m. before facing the Cardinal for
a repeat result at 2 p.m. later that
same day.
Stanford has just one game re
maining this season against Cal,
who currently holds the lead in the
Pac-12 standings. The Cardinal al
ready took down the Bears 5-2 ear
lier this season in Berkeley, but Cal
has been on a hot streak after beat
ing both No. 2 UCLA and No. 13
USC a few weekends ago. The win
ner of next Saturday's Stanford-
Cal dual match will almost certain
ly win the regular season Pac-12 ti
tle before the conference tourna
ment starts on April 24.
The Cardinal face off against
the Golden Bears on Saturday at
the Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
The match will begin at noon.

Freshman Caroline Doyle (above) is ranked No. 41 in the nation and
proved why as she won the first singles match of the day against
Oregon. Stanford would eventually sweep the Ducks in a 4-0 victory.
