## STREAK STRETCHES TO 11 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 3 Stanford men's vol
leyball team (20-7,17-7 MPSF) fin
ished its regular season schedule
on an 11-match win streak after
road wins over No. 6 UC-Irvine
and UC-San Diego. The Cardinal
reached the 20-win mark for the
fourth time under head coach John
Kosty.

After struggling especially
on the road earlier in the season,
Stanford has found its rhythm as a
team and currently has the longest
winning streak in the MPSF. The
11-match winning streak is also the

longest in Stanford history since a
16-game streak in 1997.
On Friday, the Cardinal faced
No. 6 UC-Irvine at Irvine, Calif.
Stanford clinched a home-court ad
vantage for the quarterfinals of the
MPSF Tournament with the win,
increasing its winning streak to 10.
The Anteaters, however, proved to
be strong competitors and the win
was not an easy one for the Cardi
nal. This was only the second win of

the last 11 that went to five sets.
Prior to the win streak, Stanford
had not won a match that went to
five sets during the season.
The win demonstrates just how
far Stanford has come as a team
this season. After straggling both
in road matches and in longer
matches, the Cardinal finally won a
five-set match on the road and

4/12, San Diego
did so in impressive fashion.
The back-and-forth
match was suspenseful, with
the two teams going set for
set. Stanford took the first,
third and final set while the
Anteaters won the second
and fourth. UCI came out ag
gressively, leading the first
set 14-7 early. However, the
Cardinal were able to rally
back and win the next five
straight to eventually tie the
set 18-18. Senior outside hit
ter Steven Irvin's ace won
the first set at 24-21.
The second set was the
complete opposite of the

first, with Stanford leading
early 10-4 before the
Anteaters went on an im
pressive run and won the set
25-21. The third set was
back-and-forth while the
fourth set was a struggle for
both teams but especially for
Stanford, which hit just .057
and had eight errors. How
ever, Stanford was able to
rally back from the rut as
Irvin led the final effort in
the fifth set with a kill and
block to ultimately end the
set and win the match.
UCI actually outhit the
Cardinal .269 to .256, with
neither team having a great
attack percentage. Senior
outside hitter Brian Cook led
the Cardinal with 18 kills and
hit .350. Irvin also hit double
digits in kills with 15. Irvin

also recorded a double-dou
ble by adding a match-high
13 digs. UCI was led by out
side hitters Jeremy Dejno
with 17 kills and Connor
Hughes with 14 kills.
Stanford hit .385 against
UCSD the following night,
marking the 19th time the
Cardinal have hit over .300
this season. Once again,
Cook led the team with 19
kills, hitting a close-to-per
fect .677 for the night. It was
one of Cook's most impres
sive and formidable perform
ances so far this season,
demonstrating why he is one
of the top players in the
country. He had just one hit
ting error and consistently
stepped up at key points
throughout the match. Multi
ple seniors had powerful of
fensive performances, with
Irvin recording 12 kills and
Eric Mochalski recording
seven. Stanford also had an
impressive blocking night,
with sophomore middle Con
rad Kaminski recording
eight blocks while Cook and
Mochalski contributed three
each.
While UC-San Diego end
ed the season 4-23 overall
with only two conference
wins, the Tritons had one of
their best offensive perform
ances of the season, hitting
.336 for the night. Seniors
Nick lorfino and Johl Aw
erkamp, who had 15 and 14
kills respectively for the
night, led their offense. De
spite the impressive Senior
Night performance by the
Tritons, the dominant Cardi
nal proved too powerful for
UCSD's defense and were
able to hold on to their win
streak as the regular season
drew to a close.
With its two wins this
weekend, the team heads in
to the postseason with a
guarantee to host a home
match for the quarterfinals
of the MPSF Tournament
and will face UCI for a re
match on Saturday at 7 p.m.
at Maples Pavilion.
