The No. 3 Stanford men's vol
leyball team (20-7,17-7 MPSF) fin
ished its regular season schedule
on an 11-match win streak after
road wins over No. 6 UC-Irvine
and UC-San Diego. The Cardinal
reached the 20-win mark for the
fourth time under head coach John
Kosty.

After struggling especially
on the road earlier in the season,
Stanford has found its rhythm as a
team and currently has the longest
winning streak in the MPSF. The
11-match winning streak is also the

longest in Stanford history since a
16-game streak in 1997.
On Friday, the Cardinal faced
No. 6 UC-Irvine at Irvine, Calif.
Stanford clinched a home-court ad
vantage for the quarterfinals of the
MPSF Tournament with the win,
increasing its winning streak to 10.
The Anteaters, however, proved to
be strong competitors and the win
was not an easy one for the Cardi
nal. This was only the second win of

the last 11 that went to five sets.
Prior to the win streak, Stanford
had not won a match that went to
five sets during the season.
The win demonstrates just how
far Stanford has come as a team
this season. After straggling both
in road matches and in longer
matches, the Cardinal finally won a
five-set match on the road and
