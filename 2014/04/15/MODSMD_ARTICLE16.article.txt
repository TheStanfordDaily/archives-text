# OPINIONS
## OP-ED In defense of the Stanford African Students Association 
### 
Stanford African Students As
sociation (SASA) was one of
only two student organiza
tions not granted special fees by
Stanford's student body in the AS
SU Elections last week.
We are a community of students
of African descent and students in
terested in African studies commit
ted to promoting awareness about
the African continent. We work to
create an intellectual and social
space for Africans and those inter
ested in Africa at Stanford.
Our events have been highly at
tended and inclusive of the broader
Stanford community. Our most re
cent cultural show packed CEMEX
Auditorium last year. Faculty, staff
and students attended our tribute
to Nelson Mandela. Our collabora
tion with the Graduate School of
Business' Global Speakers Series
and Africa Business Forum
brought world-renowned experts to
the Stanford campus. Our candle
light vigil in solidarity with victims
of the Kenya mall attacks also
brought the campus together and
was featured on the front page of
The Stanford Daily. A SASA-pro
duced video featuring Stanford stu
dents reciting poetry in the words
of Maya Angelou's Mandela poem
has been viewed thousands of times
online and was featured in the
Stanford Report. We also have a
Big Sib mentorship program for 40
upperclassmen and about 20 fresh
men to provide academic support,
introduce them to the college envi
ronment and help them transition
to life in the United States.
As leaders of SASA, we were
heartbroken to find that we fell on
ly 0.76 percent short of the re
quired 15 percent of student sup
port in order to receive special fees.
For the 2014-15 school year, we re
quested joint undergraduate and
graduate special fees in order to
fund our activities.
Seventy-five percent of under
graduate voters supported SASA's
special fees, while 53 percent of
graduate voters voted in our favor.
This was surprising to us because
we have always collaborated exten
sively and successfully with gradu
ate students and their groups.
Graduate students from the med-

ical, business and law schools, as
well as the Schools of Engineering,
Education and Humanities and Sci
ences, actively participate in our
events. While increased support
from either undergrad or graduate
students could have made a differ
ence in our case, we note that more
than three times as many under
graduate students voted in favor of
our fees than graduate students.
There may be any number of ex
planations for why we did not re
ceive more support from either un
dergrads or graduate students. The
bottom line is that we need re
sources to continue to operate. The
events and programs we host have
an impact on the quality of life for
many at Stanford, especially inter
national students from Africa who
depend on SASA as a supportive
community. SASA's efforts con
tribute to the intellectual and cul
tural experiences that help make
Stanford a proudly diverse commu
nity and to deprive us of the sup
port to celebrate and share our cul
ture is to deny us a voice.
Our annual flagship event, the
African Cultural Show, happens to
be this Friday, April 18 at 6 EM. in
CEMEX Auditorium. If you think
SASA deserved special fees, or if
you're unsure or don't know
enough, come check out the African
Cultural Show. There will be deli
cious food, celebrated Kenyan mu
sicians, a fashion show and per
formances from student groups.
Come see firsthand where the spe
cial fees you kindly supported us
with last year are going. We are
very proud of the work we have
done all year long to make this a
great event, and we hope to see you
there.
