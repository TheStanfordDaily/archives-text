## ASSU Elections: a case study 
### Josh Jones 
The greatest obstacles our na
tion faces today are its unin
formed electorate and its ten
dency to allow others to do our re
search and thinking for us. After
witnessing the ASSU Elections last
week, I realized campus politics
were the perfect case study for
these same problems.
First, consider the general igno
rance and apathy of the student
body with regards to the ASSU
system, its officers, initiatives and
funding practices (full disclosure: I
am totally in this category). How
many of us actually know what the
Undergraduate Senate does? Who
are these guys running for office,
anyway? The only one I knew (and
voted for) was Anthony Ghosn. The
fact is, even when I manage to read
up on the candidates, I often won
der how many of their ideas are
possible and how many are like the
popular middle school campaign
pledge to improve school lunches:
awesome, but entirely infeasible.
Similarly, national polls confirm
on a monthly basis that a shocking
percentage of Americans have no
idea what is actually going on,
whether the question is on which
party is in control of Congress, the
nature of Obamacare or where
Ukraine is located. In spite of this,
almost everyone claims to have an
opinion, and almost as many vote to
influence the system. The problem
is, when we haven't researched the
issues ourselves, we tend to just be
lieve whatever someone else tells
us; in other words, we let others
cast our vote.
To be clear, I do not mean to
question the sincerity or compe
tence of the small core of activists
who actually know what they're

talking about on or off campus.
There are always those who have
carefully studied the candidates
and issues and decided to spread
the word. For example, I presume
that the leaders of the divestment
movement on campus are well in
formed on both the pros and cons of
hydraulic fracturing, the role Stan
ford's money plays in it and the
consequences of the proposed with
drawal of Stanford funds from the
industry. But how many of us who
voted "yes" or "no" on divestment
can claim to have done that kind of
homework? I sure as heck can't.
How about all the hoopla on
SAFE Reform? I'm sure we all re
ceived a slew of emails filled with
various claims and counterclaims
on the proposed legislation. It was
a classic case of "he said, she said,"
and in the end I think we all just
kind of decided which group of peo
ple we believed more. I authored an
investigative piece on SAFE Re
form for the Stanford Review, but
the contradicting claims still left
me confused enough to abstain on
the measure.
In any case, I felt silly voting for
a bill that I hadn't even read. Now
that would be an interesting poll!
How many of those who voted
up or down on SAFE Reform
actually read the 52-page bill
in its entirety? In our defense, I
think only those with ample experi
ence with the ASSU funding sys
tem would have had much hope of
understanding it.
The point is, this kind of unin
formed voting may be alright when
dealing with small campus issues,
but in "real life" we frequently see
large groups of people voting based
on a few headlines and sound bites
they got from FOX News or CNN.
How many people could explain the
geopolitical considerations of the
War on Terror or the financial pro
jections for Obamacare? In short,
many are happy to view the world
through the eyes of Ed Shultz or
Rush Limbaugh and call it a day.
Why not? With only limited effort,
we can take someone else's word as
scripture and have a ready-made
argument to defend our vote.
Democracies are not immune to
failure. Indeed, America's success
has traditionally been the excep
tion, not the norm. And it has been
our tradition of civic engagement
that has consistently made our

democracy work. An essential ele
ment of democracy is that we take
our votes seriously.
Again, I'm not saying you can't
believe everything Wolf Blitzer
says. If you really see eye-to-eye
with John Stossel on everything,
more power to you. I simply submit
that if we truly want to see change
in our country, we need to care
enough to do our own research,
verify the facts with multiple
sources and vote intelligently.
