# SUPER TUESDAY
## Four minority issues more important than ASSU elections 
### Nick Ahamed 
Saturday saw the conclusion of
this year's ASSU general
spring election. Nearly every
group had their Special Fees re
quest approved (Stanford Quid
ditch and Stanford African Stu
dents Association were the only
two that didn't). Students over
whelmingly supported University
divestment from fossil fuels, with
about three-fourths voting yes.
SAFE Reform did not earn the
two-thirds share of the vote needed
for a constitutional amendment.
However, despite a huge effort by
the Students of Color Coalition,
more students voted in favor of
SAFE Reform than voted against.
As a student of color myself, I was
sad to see the campus unnecessarily
divided along racial and ethnic lines.
SAFE Reform is undoubtedly
something that should be discussed
on campus. But there are more im
portant issues facing our state and
nation that students of color should
be channeling their energy into
solving.
1. Immigration
There are an estimated 12 mil
lion people living in this country
without documents, some of them
Stanford students. Research indi
cates that undocumented workers
earn significantly less than individ
uals who immigrated legally. More
over, minors who were brought to
this country illegally face unneces
sarily high obstacles in life, employ
ment and society relative to their
peers. The welcome of The New
Colossus is extended to only a cer
tain subset of immigrants.
It's clear that solutions like the
continued deportation, let alone the
"self-deportation" proposed by
Mitt Romney, of undocumented
families are not practical. At the
same time, Republicans consistent
ly block a pathway to citizenship.
Hispanics can be an extremely in
fluential in elections. However, it
will take more than pressure from
Hispanic voters to change enough
votes in Congress. While there are
immigration activists at Stanford,
immigration isn't an issue dis
cussed by the campus at large. It
should be.
2. Education
As I have written before, the
American education system drasti

cally disfavors minority students.
African Americans score 100 points
lower on each section of the SAT
relative to their white peers. One
third of Hispanics perform below
their grade level, and only 16 per
cent hold college degrees, accord
ing to the American Federation of
Teachers. Education is critical to a
person's future career and earn
ings, so even though the problems
start early, they are long lasting.
Some people have presented
clear fixes that need to be adopted.
For example, how schools are fund
ed should be changed. School fund
ing is generally drawn from local
property taxes, a system legalized
by the U.S. Supreme Court in the
1973 San Antonio I.S.D. v. Ro
driguez case, and consequently, a
report by the Center for American
Progress highlights how public
school financing is inversely associ
ated with the wealth of the school
district. Stanford Professor Rob
Reich adds to this by demonstrat
ing how 'charity' can actually make
things worse. Unfortunately, poor
schools tend to have majority-mi
nority student bodies and generally
smaller tax bases. Because these
schools cannot afford the best
teachers who come from schools
like ours minority students often
receive a worse education than
their more well-heeled peers. Many
students volunteer in East Palo Al
to to improve the situation, but few
remain active post-graduation.
3. The Legal System
There is clear evidence that
there is institutional discrimination
in the legal system. As a Muslim
myself, I've felt the harsh reality of
racial profiling. This is not unique
among Muslims, however. New
York City's Stop and Frisk policy
overwhelmingly targets African-
Americans and Latinos. Moreover,
there are clear legal issues as well.
Mandatory minimum sentencing,
as discussed by Aimee Trujillo, of
ten penalizes minority defendants
more than white offenders.
This is one area in which Stan
ford students may have a stronger
impact than others. Organizations
like the ACLU and NAACP need
the brightest legal minds to help in
the fight for civil rights. Since these
issues are institutionally en
trenched, it will take more than

grassroots organizing and on the
ground action to legislate solutions.
Given the positions of power Stan
ford students are likely to inhabit,
awareness of and dedication to
these issues is critical.

4. Voting Rights
An issue that is both historically
and currently significant, voter
suppression is especially targeted
towards minorities. Not only have
Republicans been pushing restric
tive voter identification laws, but
the Supreme Court also struck
down Section 4(b) of the Voting
Rights Act last June, which was
specifically designed to protect mi
nority voters by giving the Attor
ney General and the District Court
of Washington, D.C. the ability to
veto voting laws in communities
with a historical record of racial dis
crimination. In Texas, for example,
a voter ID law would make it more
difficult for Hispanics to vote, since
they are between 46.5 percent and
120 percent more likely to lack the
necessary identification. Indeed,
multiple prominent Republican fig
ures have admitted that their pro
posed voter ID laws are primarily
aimed at improving the GOP's
chances in elections.

Voting rights are important not
only for democratic purposes we
should value the constitutional
promise of one person, one vote
but also for more pragmatic ones. If
minorities are suppressed at the
polls, it will become more difficult
to elect officials who will represent
their positions on important issues,
including many of the issues articu
lated here. While there is a legal
course to be taken, encouraging mi
nority involvement in state politics
may prove a more effective method
for protecting civil rights.

My hope is that we remember
that life at Stanford is far more
pleasant than it is for too many
Americans. If we do, perhaps we
can change the discussion about
SAFE Reform from counter-pro
ductive to constructive. This will al
low us not only to get back to work
on the issues that really matter for
minorities, but hopefully to also en
able more students to do the same.
