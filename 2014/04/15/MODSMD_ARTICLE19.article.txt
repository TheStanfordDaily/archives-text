## On Senate and SAFE Reform 
### ANTHONY GHOSN ASSU Senator-elect 
During the Kennedy-Nixon
presidential debate of 1960,
then-Vice President Richard
Nixon emphatically stated, "I know
Senator Kennedy feels as deeply
about these problems as I do, but
our disagreement is not about the
goals for America but only about the
means to reach those goals." This
type of amicable rhetoric has been
for the most part absent in recent
American history. It seems that in
the last few years our country's
leaders have forgotten a simple
truth: that they're united in then*
service to this nation.
This story reminds me a lot of
what took place in our political com
munity over the course of the last
week. We had a situation in which
two groups that are wholly dedicat

ed to improving our community
went head to head on how to en
hance our special fees system. It is
no secret that there is a big problem
with the way that funding works to
day. The current system is lethargic
and bureaucratic and levies one of
the highest student fees in the coun
try on our student population
three times that of Harvard and
twice that of Berkeley.
Over the course of my Under
graduate Senate campaign, I had
the chance to meet with the various
authors of the bill and get insight in
to the SOCC- and FLIP-sponsored
arguments against it. Justine and
Olivia Moore, the two genuinely im
pressive sophomores who spear
headed SAFE with Dan Ashton, Bil
ly Gallagher and Stephen Trusheim,
seemed passionate, levelheaded and
dedicated to improving this commu
nity. They mentioned to me that
they had met with over 500 people to
discuss the new funding regulations
and were very hopeful that it would
pass. It seems, however, that many
student group representatives, es
pecially those of SOCC, felt that

their concerns, although heard,
were not addressed in the actual
text of the amendment, and that is
why they decided to mobilize their
coalition against the measure. Natu
rally, this came as a surprise to
many who contributed to the bill,
and certainly to the standing Senate
who passed it unanimously, hoping
to avoid the funding cuts that we will
now have to oversee this year.
What came after was an unfortu
nate and antagonistic tension be
tween the proponents of SAFE and
its detractors. While many felt that
organizations opposed to the bill
had been spreading misinforma
tion, the opponents continuously
stated that they were pointing to
the possibility of losing vital funding
down the line. Many feared that
identity groups such as the LGBT
Community Resource Center would
be eventually defunded if SAFE
Reform passed. Some conversa
tions even descended into vitriolic
ad hominem attacks, and people I
spoke to on both sides seemed to feel
