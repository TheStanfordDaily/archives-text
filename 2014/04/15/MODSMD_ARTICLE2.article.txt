# Law students' research adopted by government
## Recommendations offered to wildlife council 
### MADELEINE HAN DESK EDITOR 
on March 20, President Oba
ma's Advisory Council on Wildlife
Trafficking met in Washington, D.C.
to put forth recommendations for
the implementation of its "National
Strategy to Combat Wildlife Traf
ficking," in a session that drew
heavily on the work of a group of
Stanford Law School students.
This past winter quarter, nine
law and master's students partici
pated in a two-credit practicum of
fered through the Stanford Law
School to devise the recommenda
tions submitted to the Advisory
Council. David Hayes J.D. '7B, a dis
tinguished visiting lecturer at the
Stanford Law School and current
co-chair of the council, led the
practicum.
Hayes, who worked previously

with the Obama administration as
Deputy Secretary of the Depart
ment of the Interior, drew attention
to the practicum's timeliness.
"It was the perfect time to have
a policy lab and focus on how to ac
tually implement a national strate
gy for this serious, global problem,"
Hayes said. The administration an
nounced the national strategy at the
beginning of winter quarter. "The
practicum plays an important role
here at the outset of the president's
focus on the issue."
The advisory council, whose
members include experts in wildlife
conservation-related fields like
World Wildlife Fund President
Carter S. Roberts, and African
Wildlife Foundation CEO Patrick J.
Bergin, will hold another public
meeting this June to consider the
students' recommendations.
Hayes highlighted the complexi

ty of tackling an ongoing issue like
wildlife trafficking in a classroom
setting.
"Part of the challenge is that
these are issues that are unfolding as
we speak. [Students need] to gather
information in real time... [this] re
quires a different type of nontradi
tional research," Hayes explained.
The students in the practicum
came from academic backgrounds
ranging from law to African Studies
to Earth Systems, a diversity re
flected by their respective roles in
the generation of the recommenda
tions.
Patrick Freeman 'l3 M.S. 'l4, who
has been involved in elephant conser
vation efforts since he was a child, de
scribed the cyclical nature of wildlife
trafficking and resultant public at
tention to conservation efforts.
According to Freeman, students
in the practicum found that one of

the biggest drivers of the recent
resurgence in demand for ivory is
the deregulation of domestic ivory
markets.
"Most countries in Africa that
have elephants are touted to have
some controlled system on ivory ex
ports and imports, but a lot of them
don't have the capacity to manage

all of that infrastructure," Freeman
explained.
He noted that government cor
ruption is also a systemic contribu
tor to wildlife trafficking.

ing potential amendments to
existing criminal codes to al
low for stiffer penalties and
expansion of the offenses for
which wildlife traffickers
can be charged.
"[We were] increasing
the tools law enforcement
can use to better investigate
and prosecute offenders,"
Sullivan said. "The thought
is that if [the United States]
does that, then other coun
tries will follow suit and that
[wildlife trafficking] will no
longer be a low-risk, high
reward crime."
Freeman elaborated on
the hope that U.S. efforts to
clamp down on illegal ivory
trading will create a domino
effect in demand-side coun
tries by augmenting public
awareness of wildlife traf
ficking issues.
He cited a recent ban on

trophy imports from Tanza
nia and Zimbabwe imple
mented by the U.S. Fishing
and Wildlife Service as an
example of national traction
against illegal ivory trading.
"The U.S. is basically
putting diplomatic and eco
nomic pressure on them,"
he said.
Though Hayes reported
that the students' recom
mendations have received
generally positive feedback,
Freeman and Sullivan com
mented on backlash from
sellers who will be affected
by increased restrictions on
ivory.
"I didn't realize that
there are people whose
livelihoods are tied up in
this," Sullivan said, citing a
businessman who sold an
tique walking sticks con
taining ivory who spoke at
the advisory council meet
ing in March.
"Their attitude is that
dealing with old ivory does
n't kill any elephants, but it
does because it just pro

vides away to launder it,"
Sullivan explained, though
she added that "we're going
to have to wait and see" how
the new restrictions on the
ivory trade are handled be
cause of their novelty.
Hayes, who will be giv
ing a campus-wide lecture
on the wildlife trafficking
crisis on May 20, elaborated
on the importance of
spreading awareness about
wildlife trafficking not only
through legislation but also
through general publicity.
"I hope the students and
anyone who comes in con
tact with [wildlife traffick
ing] will take away... an ap
preciation for the fact that
we can't take for granted
that our wildlife and natural
systems will always be
there," he said. "We all have
to be mindful of the impact
that we're having on the
health of our wildlife and our
environment."
