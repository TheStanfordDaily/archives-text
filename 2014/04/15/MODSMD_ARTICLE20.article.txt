On Monday afternoon, the Con

Chiney Ogwumike with the first
overall pick of the 2014 WNBA
Draft, who became the second Stan
ford player in three years, along with
older sister Nneka Ogwumike 'l2, to
be taken as the top pick in the annu
al professional draft. Additionally,
with the seventh pick of the third
round, the Seattle Storm drafted
fifth-year senior forward Mikaela
Ruef.
The honor for Ogwumike comes
less than a week after she received

er of the season in NCAA women's
basketball. The two-time consensus
Ail-American was also the Capital

ketball Scholar-Athlete of the Year.
This past season, Ogwumike be
came the Pac-12's all-time leading
scorer and rebounder, as well as the
Pac-12 record holder for the most
points scored and most field goals
made in a single season. In doing so,
she captained the Cardinal to a 33-4
record and a Final Four berth at the
NCAA Tournament.
Ogwumike became the Cardi
nal's 11th first-round WNBA Draft
pick in school history and the sixth
such pick in the last seven years. She
also joins Mark Appel 'l3 of baseball,
Andrew Luck 'l2 of football and
Nneka Ogwumike as the fourth Car

dinal athlete to be selected first over
all in a professional sports draft in
the last three years.
This season, Ruef helped power
the Cardinal to the Final Four as she
won the Stanford regional's Most
Outstanding Player, averaging 14
points, 11 rebounds and four assists
in Sweet 16 and Elite Eight wins
over Penn State and North Carolina,
respectively. She started 36 of the 37
games this season, developing into a
great rebounder and another scor
ing threat on the post to comple
ment Ogwumike.
