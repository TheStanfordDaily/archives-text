## THE
						FINAL COUNTDOWN 
### KRISTIN A BASSI 
As the Stanford women's
lacrosse team approaches their last
regular-season weekend, the No. 12
Cardinal (10-2, 4-1 MPSF) will face
UC-Davis (6-7, 1-5) for a midweek
Tuesday matchup. It will be the sec
ond game of a crucial four-game
stretch to wrap up the season before
the MPSF Championships and
NCAA Tournament take place in
May.
Returning from success in Eu
gene, Ore., the Cardinal hope to win
again this week and build off of the
momentum of a big conference vic
tory. Last Friday, Stanford had a
formidable performance, winning
15-7 against Oregon and its power
ful offense, which were previously
undefeated in the MPSF. Lucy
Dikeou, a sophomore midfielder,
had four goals and led the attack
along with freshman attacker
Kelsey Murray. Dikeou has scored
ten of her team-best 21 goals in the
past three games, including a ca
reer-high four goals against the
Ducks. Hannah Farr, a junior mid
fielder, also contributed six draw
controls, two ground balls and one
goal.
Defensively, senior defender
Megan Lerner, who was an All-
MPSF First Team Selection last
year, contributed five ground balls
and played a key leadership role
along with senior goalie Lyndsey
Munoz, who had six saves against
Oregon. Lerner also caused three
turnovers.
This week, the Cardinal will take
on UC-Davis. For the Aggies, junior
midfielder Elizabeth Landry with 34
goals, twelve assists and 51 draw
controls this season will lead the at
tack along with freshman attacker
Melissa Kellan, who has 22 goals.
Senior midfielder Carly Voris also
has 20 goals, 28 ground balls and 29
draw controls on the season. Also
look for offensive contributions from
sophomore midfielder Mary Doyle,
who has eleven goals, 30 ground balls
and 32 draw controls this season.
The Aggies' defense will be led
by junior goalie Kai Murphy and
her 63 saves this season and senior

defender Rachael Mack, who has
eleven ground balls. Additionally,
junior midfielder Sara Quero has 15
ground balls and 11 draw controls.
Junior defender Allie Lehner has
also contributed 26 ground balls
and five draw controls this season to
the nation's 47th-ranked defense,
which is averaging 10 goals allowed
per game.
In the Aggies' last game against
Oregon, a common opponent with
the Cardinal, they lost 8-4 despite
Landry, Voris, Doyle and sopho
more Courtney Neff each scoring
goals for UC-Davis. Goalkeeper
Jordan Majka posted seven saves
and held the Ducks to only one goal
in the second half but the Aggies
were out-shot by a 26-14 margin, in
cluding 17-6 before halftime. The
Aggies also committed 17 turnovers
to the Ducks' 11, leading to the
tough loss.
In order for Stanford to have
success this week, it will need to

look to its senior leadership on de
fense and aggressiveness on of
fense. Senior defender Meg Lerner
has played a paramount role in so
lidifying the Cardinal defense this
year with her 28 ground balls and
30 draw controls this season.
Munoz, who has 61 saves this sea
son will anchor the defense with
Lerner.
Offensively, look to Dikeou and
Farr, each with 21 goals this season,
to lead the scoring charge. Dikeou
has posted 19 ground balls and 22
draw controls and Farr has posted
24 ground balls and 27 draw con
trols. In addition, look to seniors An
na Kim, with nine goals and five as
sists, and Rachel Ozer, with 19 goals
and 11 assists, to lead the offense.
