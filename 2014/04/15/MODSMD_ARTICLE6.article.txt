## Policy implementation lab opens Freeman Spogli Institute effort aims to back faculty research 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
The Freeman Spogli Institute for
International Studies (FSI) initiated
its International Policy Implementa
tion Lab last month, reflecting an ef
fort to support, develop and fund long
term projects grounded in policy-ori
ented research on specific internation
al issues.
According to Elizabeth Gardner,
associate director for partnerships
and special labs at FSI, the new lab is
currently partly supported by an ini
tial $2 million gift from two anony
mous donors. The program is also
supported by internal Stanford fund
ing, which allowed the lab to get off
the ground and roll out softly over the
past few weeks.
"The lab came about because there
are quite a few faculty that are doing
policy-orientated research involving
external organizations and concerned
with how policy implementation hap
pens and how it's executed," Gardner
said.
At the moment, the lab supports
six research projects. According to
Gardner, the lab can be seen as both

an overarching umbrella organization
grouping together the various policy
based research projects and as a foun
dational support system for the re
search projects.
According to FSI director Mari
ano-Florentino Cuellar M.A. '96 Ph.D.
'OO, the lab's role as a support system
could include acting as a central loca
tion of resources that are easily acces
sible to both faculty and students or
offering meeting spaces where faculty
and students working on similar proj
ects can meet with one another to ex
change their ideas and thus facilitate
interdisciplinary work.
"It's not just about doing analysis
and writing papers," Cuellar said.
"It's about building relations with dif
ferent organizations and scholars. It's
about thinking about the intersection
of politics and policy. These different
ventures can learn from each other.
We're bringing different projects that
have similar missions under one roof."
Adam Gorlick, communication
manager for FSI, noted that the new
lab strengthened relationships not on
ly between different disciplines of pol
icy, but also between the researchers
and the external organizations with
whom they work.
"We're building relationships with
the scholar and are open to partner
with governments and non-govern
mental organizations, [to] building

those relationships between outside
organizations," Gorlick said. "The in
formation that can be transferred will
benefit both the outsiders and the
knowledge of the academics."
Gorlick emphasized the value to
the lab of student engagement.
"There's a huge student compo
nent and one of the requirements for
projects that come into the policy lab
is that they need to have a very strong
teaching mission," Gorlick said. "This
is both in terms of hands-on working
and ... research. We want to get stu
dents interested. [The lab] isn't just a
resource for faculty but is also away
to get students involved."
Gardner observed that classes are
currently taught through the lab
based on faculty members' research,
and noted that in the future the lab
hopes to offer more classes as well as
internships for both undergraduates
and graduate students.
"I hope that the opportunities will
be substantial for students and under
lying that goal is providing enhanced
opportunities for student learning,"
Gardner said. "There's a student fel
lowship program that we've just re
ceived funding for, and we'll probably
get ready in the next couple of months
to announce it."
