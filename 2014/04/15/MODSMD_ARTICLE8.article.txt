## Innovation program introduces Ph.D. students to Silicon Valley 
### SILVIANA CIUREA ILCUS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Accel Innovation Scholars (AIS) pro
gram a yearlong program that seeks to in
troduce engineering doctoral students to Sili
con Valley's entrepreneurial ecosystem will
offer its second iteration starting this July,
shortly after the initiative's inaugural class
graduates from the program.
Inspired by the successful Mayfield Fel
lows Program's work with undergraduates,
the AIS program creators wanted to build an
equally compelling program for Ph.D. stu
dents, according to Tina Seelig Ph.D. 'B5, exec
utive director for the Stanford Technology
Ventures Program (STVP).
Anai's Saint-Jude, special projects designer
at STVI] explained that the program is direct
ed not only at students who want to start a
company but also at those who do not already
have experience with formal leadership.
"Entrepreneurship is a life skill [which] will
benefit anybody who dives into it," Saint-Jude
said.
"We would be delighted if [the scholars]
chose to become faculty at a university," she
added. "This [year's] group was a mixed group
... and we had varying levels of expertise
across the scholars."
Tommy Dißaimondo M.S. 'l2 Ph.D. 'l4,
one of this year's scholars, said that he had ap
plied to the program in order to expand his
knowledge about startups, based in part on
the desire to learn how to commercialize a
product he invented during his Ph.D. When
his Ph.D. work went faster than he anticipat
ed, he ended up founding his company
Sitari Pharma while still participating in
AIS.
"I've really benefitted [from AIS] by be
coming a better leader and communicator,"
Dißaimondo said. "It's really helped me so far
in the start-up environment."
On the other hand, Victor Miller M.S. 'll
Ph.D. 'l6, another scholar, said he had consid
ered going into academia rather than the en
trepreneurial ecosystem.
"[Faculty jobs] are traditionally very far
from entrepreneurship, but when you think
about what professors do, it's super entrepre
neurial," Miller said. "[They] have to be cre
ative and resourceful."
Miller argued that AIS has not only given
him practical entrepreneurship-related tools
but also developed his ability to be resource
ful. He explained that the program helped him
become more comfortable working at the in

tersection of different disciplines.
"Those attitudes will permeate through
whatever I end up doing," he said.
According to Seelig and Saint-Jude, the
program is designed with the goals, perspec
tives and schedules of Ph.D. students in mind.
It begins with an intensive week that focuses
on building the cohort and introducing stu
dents to the Silicon Valley entrepreneurial
ecosystem before structuring activities and
weekly meetings between the scholars for the
following three quarters.
During fall quarter the group will visit and
meet with senior executives at law firms,
startups and venture capital firms. These
leaders, usually CEOs or vice presidents, will
present living case studies for which the schol
ars, grouped in small teams, will try to find so
lutions.
In winter quarter, scholars will be paired
with company-leading coaches based on their
backgrounds, and after assessing the chal
lenges facing that firm, the students will lead
a session to present their findings and solu
tions to the coaches and their fellow scholars.
"The companies are totally blown away
that [the scholars] are able to think so clearly
about the problems [the companies] are fac
ing," Seelig said. "In several cases, [the com
panies] may have tweaked their strategy
based 0n... our students."
Sessions in spring quarter will take place
on campus and focus on entrepreneurial lead
ership. As an optional summer addition to the
program, scholars can choose to pursue an in
ternship at a startup through the AIS pro
gram.
Throughout the program, the students
craft their "professional happiness design"
in other words, their AIS Ph.Ds.
"[This is] the opportunity for them to re
flect on what they're learning and to build a
framework to navigate their career," Saint-
Jude said.
Miller explained that students with deep
technical backgrounds and an interest in tak
ing technologies outside the lab in order to
make a difference are best suited for the pro
gram.
"These experiences were really good for
Ph.D. students, because we typically don't do
anything but our own research," Miller said.
"It's really nice to realize that a lot of the skills
that we've been working on developing in
graduate school and before are actually appli
cable to all these problems.
