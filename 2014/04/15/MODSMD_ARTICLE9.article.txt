## Trimpi, professor emeritus, passes away 
### â€” Andrew Vogeley 
Wesley Trimpi '5O, professor emeritus of
English, died March 6 of pneumonia. He was
85.
Trimpi, who returned to Stanford in 1957
after receiving his Ph.D. from Harvard,
taught poetry in the Department of English
until his retirement in 1992.
At the beginning of his career, Trimpi pub
lished work on 17th-century lyric poetry. As
his career proceeded, he developed an inter
est in ancient poetic theory.
One of his most well-known books is
"Muses of One Mind: The Literary Analysis
of Experience and Its Continuity," which ex
plores the history of the field of literary crit
icism and how ancient writing on literature
used terms from other fields like mathemat
ics and philosophy.
Trimpi continued this work with analysis
of Plato, Aristotle and Horace.
Kathy Eden Ph.D. 'BO, a current Colum
bia professor who had been a graduate stu
dent under Trimpi, spoke about Trimpi to the
Stanford News Service.
"The questions that preoccupied him in
and out of the classroom proved fundamental

to understanding the deep investment of the
ancients, their admirers and even their de
tractors, throughout the centuries in what we
call 'literature' today," she said.
