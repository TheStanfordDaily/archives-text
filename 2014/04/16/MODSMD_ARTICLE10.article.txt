## SEEING GREEN Sex sells 
### Holly Moeller 
I once wrote a column called "Go
ing Topless." It wasn't my best
piece, but it was one of my most
popular, presumably because read
ers had to click the headline to find
out what the column was really
about (the impacts the loss of top
predators has on the ecosystem).
I'm sure that some of those
readers, upon discovering that the
latest Seeing Green installment
wasn't set on a nude beach, quickly
headed off in search of other read
ing material. But a few, drawn in by
a titillating headline, may have
learned something unexpected
about conservation biology and en
vironmental science. And perhaps
that something planted a seed that
shaped a future trip to the farmer's
market or even the voting booth. At
least, that's what I hoped for when
I selected the risque title.
The ways in which we deliver
messages to the public form the
foundation of a $5OO billion adver
tising industry, the meat of tens of
thousands of scientific studies and
the talking points of political strate
gists the world over.
And, as environmental scientists
release increasingly ominous pre
dictions and ever more dire warn
ings about the future of the planet,
activists are leveraging marketing
knowledge to find the best way to
pass on the bad news.
It's an uphill battle in a political
environment that, regardless of the
(increasingly unequivocal) state of
climate science, is viciously polar
ized. One side is populated by argu
ments for heading off a climate ca
tastrophe that could jeopardize hu
man civilization. The other side
fears surrendering freedoms and
liberties more than uncertain and
distant threats. Somewhere in the
middle (and scattered around the
edges) are those who have insuffi
cient information to make a judg
ment call or are too overwhelmed
by the scale of the problem to
meaningfully engage with its al
leged solutions. Stymied by the ap
parent disregard for the scientific
consensus, many of the scientists
doing the work are beginning to
throw up their hands in frustration.
Into this fray now march the
celebrities.
A new Showtime series on cli
mate change called "Years of Liv
ing Dangerously" hopes to entice
the American public with house
hold names like Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Don Cheadle and
Harrison Ford, and hold their at
tention for hour-long installments
using silver screen-worthy cine
matography and dramatic narra
tives.
Celebrity presence offers its
own brand of "sex appeal" in a
country uniquely fascinated by its
Hollywood stars. Not only are the
lifestyles of the rich and famous in
stantly newsworthy, but the well
liked among the famous set also be
come our opinion leaders. That's
why certain actors and socialites
can make millions on advertising
deals and become invaluable assets
to the causes they espouse.
This isn't the first time a celebri
ty has loaned his or her name to an
environmental cause. Leonardo Di-
Caprio has been repping green
causes for years. And shark conser
vationists enlisted Yao Ming in

their campaign against shark fin
soup, a popular Chinese delicacy
that drives demand for the increas
ingly rare fins.
The premise of programs like
the James Cameron-directed
"Years of Living Dangerously" is
that education and knowledge are
what's missing. By making the
message more charismatic and res
onant, these programs posit, we
can motivate awareness and, ulti
mately, change.
Certainly, it can't hurt to have
more examples for us to see, espe
cially the deeply humanized ones
that Cameron's series brings to life.
But some claim that these "public
awareness" agendas do little to ad
vance the debate. Certainly, they
can motivate short-term pragma
tism (like a letter to stop Keystone
XL, or the purchase of a Prius), but
their effects rarely linger. And ar
guably, by coming from within the
establishment that got us here in
the first place consumerist capi
talismâ€” celebrity soundbites and
public service documentaries don't
stimulate the grass-roots social
movement that will truly move us
away from the status quo of climate
change-driving fossil fuels.
In spite of all its emotional reso
nance, "Years of Living Dangerous
ly" isn't really capable of pulling so
ciety in a radically different direc
tion. Its glossy panoramas and fa
mous faces were born out of our en
ergy-intensive, capitalist society, af
ter all. The carbon footprint of its
production which could of course
be offset by the planting of a few
hundred acres of forest can only
partly be justified by the impor
tance of its message. Assuming
that we even need more of these
messages.
Then again, who's really going
to complain about watching Jessica
Alba strut across the television
screen, even if she is talking about
climate change?
After all, sex sells.
