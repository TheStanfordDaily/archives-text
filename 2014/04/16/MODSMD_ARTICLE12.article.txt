# Why computer science is awesome

### Vihan Lakshman 
It's no secret that computer sci
ence is a big deal on campus.
With 246 major declarations
two years ago and even more last
year, the subject has continued to
distance itself from other under
graduate majors in terms of popu
larity. Moreover, close to 2,000 stu
dents in total study some form of
computer science during their time
at Stanford, with a record 608 stu
dents enrolled in CS 106A: Pro
gramming Methodology last fall.
Many have attributed the explo
sion of interest in computer science
on campus to students' desire to
major in something practical or the
pressure and influences stemming
from attending a university in the
heart of Silicon Valley. For example,
author William Deresiewicz argues
that student desires to pursue
"practical" majors like CS dissuade
them from considering life's major
questions and pursuing a liberal ed
ucation.
I am not a computer science ma-

jor (or anything yet, for that mat
ter) so I may not be fully qualified to
talk about this subject. But, with
that being said, I think we should be
encouraged by the tremendous in
terest in computer science because,
simply put, the subject is awesome
and an indispensable part of a 21st
century liberal arts education.
For those like Deresiewicz
who frame the rise of CS as a deci
sion by students to pick up an em

ployable trade skill over choosing a
subject with serious intellectual vi
tality, I would point them to an anal
ogy that Mehran Sahami, my CS
106A professor, made during the
second day of class.
"Computer science is the study
of problem solving. A computer sci
entist views a computer the way an
astronomer views a telescope. It's a
way to get at what you're really in
terested in studying."
Often, the arguments suggest
ing that computer science is an anti
intellectual discipline rely on a
strawman. Their image of a com
puter science student seems to be of
a sun-deprived geek sitting for
hours and typing Is and Os as fast as
he can.
The reality is far different. Com
puter science is about thinking how
best to solve a challenging problem
and having the imagination to see
the world differently more than it is

CSisan
indispensable part
of a 21st century
liberal education.
