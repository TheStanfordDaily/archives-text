# Why computer science is awesome
## 
### Vihan Lakshman 
It's no secret that computer sci
ence is a big deal on campus.
With 246 major declarations
two years ago and even more last
year, the subject has continued to
distance itself from other under
graduate majors in terms of popu
larity. Moreover, close to 2,000 stu
dents in total study some form of
computer science during their time
at Stanford, with a record 608 stu
dents enrolled in CS 106A: Pro
gramming Methodology last fall.
Many have attributed the explo
sion of interest in computer science
on campus to students' desire to
major in something practical or the
pressure and influences stemming
from attending a university in the
heart of Silicon Valley. For example,
author William Deresiewicz argues
that student desires to pursue
"practical" majors like CS dissuade
them from considering life's major
questions and pursuing a liberal ed
ucation.
I am not a computer science ma-

jor (or anything yet, for that mat
ter) so I may not be fully qualified to
talk about this subject. But, with
that being said, I think we should be
encouraged by the tremendous in
terest in computer science because,
simply put, the subject is awesome
and an indispensable part of a 21st
century liberal arts education.
For those like Deresiewicz
who frame the rise of CS as a deci
sion by students to pick up an em

ployable trade skill over choosing a
subject with serious intellectual vi
tality, I would point them to an anal
ogy that Mehran Sahami, my CS
106A professor, made during the
second day of class.
"Computer science is the study
of problem solving. A computer sci
entist views a computer the way an
astronomer views a telescope. It's a
way to get at what you're really in
terested in studying."
Often, the arguments suggest
ing that computer science is an anti
intellectual discipline rely on a
strawman. Their image of a com
puter science student seems to be of
a sun-deprived geek sitting for
hours and typing Is and Os as fast as
he can.
The reality is far different. Com
puter science is about thinking how
best to solve a challenging problem
and having the imagination to see
the world differently more than it is

CSisan
indispensable part
of a 21st century
liberal education.
about gaining a ticket to a job.
Whether thinking through a sophis
ticated algorithm or persevering
through debugging a program,
computer science does increase
one's appreciation for solving diffi
cult problems and provides the
framework to solve new ones, which

results in a stimulating educational
experience.
When Keith Schwarz demon
strated how to solve the Towers of
Hanoi problem using recursion or
how Kruskal's Algorithm finds the
minimum-spanning tree of a graph
in CS 1068, I let out a small but
nonetheless audible gasp from
my seat in NVIDIA Auditorium be
cause my mind was actually blown
away. It was a stimulating intellec
tual experience for me, the kind
that reminds you why you decided

to show up for class and why you're
even at college in the first place.
I also think it's unfair to pin the
surge in computer science interest
on the economy and current job
market, because that detracts from
the students who are in love with
the subject and the excellent teach
ers in the department who do a fan
tastic job of igniting that spark
within students. Sahami, Schwarz,
Eric Roberts and Jerry Cain
amongst others are some of the
best lecturers in any subject at any
university, and they all teach intro
ductory courses to students with lit
tle to no background in the subject.
If the math department followed
the same model of having polished,
passionate professors teaching
Math 51 as opposed to nervous
postdocs, I'm sure that people
would start taking it out of interest
rather than necessity.
I'm not trying to say that CS can
be a substitute for humanistic in
quiry, because I also strongly be
lieve that an undergraduate educa
tion can be the perfect time to ex
plore fundamental questions like
"What is the meaning of life?" and
"What does it mean to be moral?"
That's why I'm a huge fan of the
new joint major programs in CS
and Music and CS and English,
which were discussed extensively in
The Daily's "Humanities in the 21st
Century" Op-Ed Series. I believe
these programs will be a wonderful
option for Stanford undergradu
ates, not because they provide an
employable skill to English majors,
but because they recognize the in
tellectual value computer sci
ence has as a key component of
a modern liberal arts educa
tion.

Computer science is not awe
some strictly because of its practi
cal element, or its current value in
the job market. It's awesome be
cause it provides the opportunity to
create something brand new and to
develop the mental ability to attack
difficult problems in a variety of
fields from biology to economics
and even to literature.

Thus, as long as students are
studying computer science ei
ther as a major or for just one class
out of a genuine interest in the
field, we should celebrate the
growth of computer science be
cause it is a beautiful, challenging
subject that can contribute to a bal
anced undergraduate education,
one that can leave students with a
love of learning and an appreciation
for problem solving and then in
spire them to use that telescope to
explore the wonders of the uni
verse.

Vihan Lakshmm wasn't kidding
when he said he is currently unde
clared. Convince him to major in
history at vihan@stanford.edu.
