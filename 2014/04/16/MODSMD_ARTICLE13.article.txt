# On changing the world

When you're in the epicenter
of technological innova
tions and at the cutting
edge of science, it's easy to get car
ried away. "Change-the-worid" sto
ries abound, and "creating impact"
is the staple of many a student's
personal ambitions. In dining halls,
one frequently has meals interrupt
ed by a starry-eyed student-cum
entrepreneur promoting a new app
or business idea that promises to be
game-changing and disruptive.
Usually, the "nothing-like-any
thing-you've-seen-before" app
turns out to solve a problem that
wasn't even there to begin with. Do
I really need yet another "game
changing" mobile payment app that
lets me pay my friend who sits right
across from me at the dinner table?

Here on the Stanford campus,
making something cool beats mak
ing something that matters. Too of
ten one encounters smart, well
trained engineers who could help
cure cancer or fix healthcare.gov
but who are working on a sexting
app. And then there are those who
take Peter Thiel's drop-out-of-col
lege advice seriously. Each year,
more than a few students drop out
of college to work full-time on their
next-big-startup-idea. In a recent

conversation with my former lec
turer, she complained about a stu
dent of hers who was not paying at
tention in class because he was
working on his new startup during
her lectures. By the end of the
quarter, the sophomore told her he
was dropping out to start a compa
ny.

It feels almost as if starting a
startup should be on the bucket list
of every Stanford student. "You're
a Stanford student," I was once
asked, "what's your startup?"
Maybe that explains why, instead of
hearing "I'm going to solve Prob
lem X," we are increasingly hearing
"I want to start a company." On
some rare occasions, one encoun
ters real diamonds in the rough
like Code the Change, which tries
to bring computer science and so
cial change together to benefit non
profits but an initiative like this
one is the exception rather than the
norm.
Sometimes, the "world" we
think we know is in fact so small it
extends no further than the Silicon
Valley bubble. It's a world where
apps and new technology are being
built to make lives better but for
