# On changing the world
## 
### Chi Ling Chan 
When you're in the epicenter
of technological innova
tions and at the cutting
edge of science, it's easy to get car
ried away. "Change-the-worid" sto
ries abound, and "creating impact"
is the staple of many a student's
personal ambitions. In dining halls,
one frequently has meals interrupt
ed by a starry-eyed student-cum
entrepreneur promoting a new app
or business idea that promises to be
game-changing and disruptive.
Usually, the "nothing-like-any
thing-you've-seen-before" app
turns out to solve a problem that
wasn't even there to begin with. Do
I really need yet another "game
changing" mobile payment app that
lets me pay my friend who sits right
across from me at the dinner table?

Here on the Stanford campus,
making something cool beats mak
ing something that matters. Too of
ten one encounters smart, well
trained engineers who could help
cure cancer or fix healthcare.gov
but who are working on a sexting
app. And then there are those who
take Peter Thiel's drop-out-of-col
lege advice seriously. Each year,
more than a few students drop out
of college to work full-time on their
next-big-startup-idea. In a recent

conversation with my former lec
turer, she complained about a stu
dent of hers who was not paying at
tention in class because he was
working on his new startup during
her lectures. By the end of the
quarter, the sophomore told her he
was dropping out to start a compa
ny.

It feels almost as if starting a
startup should be on the bucket list
of every Stanford student. "You're
a Stanford student," I was once
asked, "what's your startup?"
Maybe that explains why, instead of
hearing "I'm going to solve Prob
lem X," we are increasingly hearing
"I want to start a company." On
some rare occasions, one encoun
ters real diamonds in the rough
like Code the Change, which tries
to bring computer science and so
cial change together to benefit non
profits but an initiative like this
one is the exception rather than the
norm.
Sometimes, the "world" we
think we know is in fact so small it
extends no further than the Silicon
Valley bubble. It's a world where
apps and new technology are being
built to make lives better but for
a subset of society that is already
very privileged. The "problems"
that emerge out of need-finding
(rather than need-solving) exercis
es tend to be very first-world, and
in part this is because the ideas
that are rewarded here in Silicon
Valley are those that solve "prob
lems" faced by a very narrow de
mographic ours. But some such
problems are really not even prob
lems to begin with.
And when real problems are
taken on, the approaches taken
have a tendency to exhibit traits of
what Evgeny Morozov calls a "so
lutionist" predisposition: the idea
that there is a technological quick
fix for every problem in the world.
For the record, "Africa? There's an
app for it" is a real headline on
Wired. There is a tendency to fix
ate on what the new arsenal of dig
ital technologies allow us to do
without first inquiring what is
worth doing.
Silicon Valley and this is
true, to some extent, of Stanford
too has no lack of damn-the-es
tablishment hackers and Utopian
cyber-gurus who like to view tech
nology as beyond politics and soci
ety. It is a worldview rooted in their
belief in technological determinism
the reductionist perspective
that presumes that everything, in
cluding social relations, will sort it
self out as long as we have techno
logical progress.
Solutions to real social prob
lems those that actually do
make a difference are usually
less sexy. Technology can be part of
the solution, but it seldom is, if
ever, the silver bullet. That "para
digm-shifting" shiny new app
might be spiffy and might have had
venture capitalists pouring in mil
lions in funding, but it does not
save the world.
The pressing problems of our
day from poverty to inequality,
public health to education systems
require adroit inventions and
adaptations in politics and social
relations. They often demand long

and protracted institutional re
sponses, not one-off hackathons.
And then there are the real-life
equivalent of NP-hard problems:
problems to which there might not
even exist a solution, and for
which we can only expect a good
response. Let's also agree that
there is no app that can "save
Africa" if "saving Africa" is even
a sensible phrase to use at all.
If you're on your way to build
ing the next app that the first
world will love for a few months
and then forget, think hard about
whether you're delivering on the
promise of making the world a bet
ter place. Don't start a startup just
because you can. Think outside of
the technological quick-fix box. If
you see a problem that could re
quire a technological approach, try
building non-technological solu
tions to fix it. And, finally, if
"changing the world" is part of the
personal narrative that motivates
what you do, then perhaps the first

cyber-gurus who like to view tech
nology as beyond politics and soci
ety. It is a worldview rooted in their
belief in technological determinism
the reductionist perspective
that presumes that everything, in
cluding social relations, will sort it
self out as long as we have techno
logical progress.
Solutions to real social prob
lems those that actually do
make a difference are usually
less sexy. Technology can be part of
the solution, but it seldom is, if
ever, the silver bullet. That "para
digm-shifting" shiny new app
might be spiffy and might have had
venture capitalists pouring in mil
lions in funding, but it does not
save the world.
The pressing problems of our
day from poverty to inequality,
public health to education systems
require adroit inventions and
adaptations in politics and social
relations. They often demand long

and protracted institutional re
sponses, not one-off hackathons.
And then there are the real-life
equivalent of NP-hard problems:
problems to which there might not
even exist a solution, and for
which we can only expect a good
response. Let's also agree that
there is no app that can "save
Africa" if "saving Africa" is even
a sensible phrase to use at all.
If you're on your way to build
ing the next app that the first
world will love for a few months
and then forget, think hard about
whether you're delivering on the
promise of making the world a bet
ter place. Don't start a startup just
because you can. Think outside of
the technological quick-fix box. If
you see a problem that could re
quire a technological approach, try
building non-technological solu
tions to fix it. And, finally, if
"changing the world" is part of the
personal narrative that motivates
what you do, then perhaps the first
step should be to try to understand
how the world works.

The "problems"
that emerge out
of need-finding
exercises tend to
be very first
world. Some are
really not even
problems.
When you're in the epicenter
of technological innova
tions and at the cutting
edge of science, it's easy to get car
ried away. "Change-the-worid" sto
ries abound, and "creating impact"
is the staple of many a student's
personal ambitions. In dining halls,
one frequently has meals interrupt
ed by a starry-eyed student-cum
entrepreneur promoting a new app
or business idea that promises to be
game-changing and disruptive.
Usually, the "nothing-like-any
thing-you've-seen-before" app
turns out to solve a problem that
wasn't even there to begin with. Do
I really need yet another "game
changing" mobile payment app that
lets me pay my friend who sits right
across from me at the dinner table?

Here on the Stanford campus,
making something cool beats mak
ing something that matters. Too of
ten one encounters smart, well
trained engineers who could help
cure cancer or fix healthcare.gov
but who are working on a sexting
app. And then there are those who
take Peter Thiel's drop-out-of-col
lege advice seriously. Each year,
more than a few students drop out
of college to work full-time on their
next-big-startup-idea. In a recent

conversation with my former lec
turer, she complained about a stu
dent of hers who was not paying at
tention in class because he was
working on his new startup during
her lectures. By the end of the
quarter, the sophomore told her he
was dropping out to start a compa
ny.

It feels almost as if starting a
startup should be on the bucket list
of every Stanford student. "You're
a Stanford student," I was once
asked, "what's your startup?"
Maybe that explains why, instead of
hearing "I'm going to solve Prob
lem X," we are increasingly hearing
"I want to start a company." On
some rare occasions, one encoun
ters real diamonds in the rough
like Code the Change, which tries
to bring computer science and so
cial change together to benefit non
profits but an initiative like this
one is the exception rather than the
norm.
Sometimes, the "world" we
think we know is in fact so small it
extends no further than the Silicon
Valley bubble. It's a world where
apps and new technology are being
built to make lives better but for
a subset of society that is already
very privileged. The "problems"
that emerge out of need-finding
(rather than need-solving) exercis
es tend to be very first-world, and
in part this is because the ideas
that are rewarded here in Silicon
Valley are those that solve "prob
lems" faced by a very narrow de
mographic ours. But some such
problems are really not even prob
lems to begin with.
And when real problems are
taken on, the approaches taken
have a tendency to exhibit traits of
what Evgeny Morozov calls a "so
lutionist" predisposition: the idea
that there is a technological quick
fix for every problem in the world.
For the record, "Africa? There's an
app for it" is a real headline on
Wired. There is a tendency to fix
ate on what the new arsenal of dig
ital technologies allow us to do
without first inquiring what is
worth doing.
Silicon Valley and this is
true, to some extent, of Stanford
too has no lack of damn-the-es

nology as beyond politics and soci
ety. It is a worldview rooted in their
