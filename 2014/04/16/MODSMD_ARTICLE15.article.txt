# SPORTS BRIEF
## Lacrosse cruises in 18-6 dismantling of UC-Davis 
### â€“ Do-Hyoung Park 
No. 13 Stanford lacrosse (11-2, 5-1 MPSF) fol
lowed up a big conference win over Oregon on Fri
day with its second-highest scoring output of the
season in a lopsided 18-6 win over UC-Davis (6-8,
1-6). Eight different Cardinal players scored two
goals each to lead a diverse scoring barrage.
It was a blowout from the beginning, with Stan
ford capturing a 4-0 lead within the first three min
utes of the match and ultimately stretching that
lead to 13-5 by the end of the first period. At that
point, Stanford had already outshot UC-Davis 23-
10 and had scored three straight goals to end the
half.
The match ultimately utilized a running clock in
the final 26 minutes due to the extent of the
blowout, and the Stanford defense still stood firm
in the second half, holding the Aggies to just one
goal after the break while the offense continued to
be productive in scoring five goals with a rotation
of players shuffling through.
With the win, Stanford sits in second place in
the MPSF behind just Denver, which still boasts a
perfect conference record. With the conference
tournament quickly approaching in early May,
Stanford just needs to win one of its three remain
ing games to guarantee itself a spot, although Den
ver's perfect record and tiebreak advantage over
the Cardinal will make a No. 1 seed unlikely.
The Cardinal will next head down to southern
California to take on San Diego State on Friday at
2 p.m.
