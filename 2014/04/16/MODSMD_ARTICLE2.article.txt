# Researchers boost cloud computing efficiency
## Quasar to elicit more work from large-scale data centers 
### KYLIE JUE DESK EDITOR 
Researchers at Stanford have
developed software that could in
crease the efficiency of cloud com
puting by eliciting more work from
the available infrastructure at
large-scale data centers.
The tool, named Quasar, uses
techniques similar to Amazon's and
Netflix's recommendation algo
rithms to determine the amount of
computing resources that an appli
cation requires to run.
Researcher Christina Delim
itrou M.S. 'l2 Ph.D. 'l7 emphasized
the problems with current meth
ods of allocating resources, which
require internal users to specify
the amount of resources needed for
their application. According to De
limitrou, statistics from companies
like Google, Microsoft and Twitter
suggest that people tend to overes
timate their needs by a factor of 10.
"If you measure the utilization
[of the current system], it's at
around 10 to 20 percent, which
means that about 80 percent of the
computing power that you could be
getting out of the machines is be

ing wasted," Delimitrou said.
Instead of asking users how
many resources they need, Quasar
asks people to specify how fast
they want their application to run.
The software then translates that
performance target into resources
based on data from similar applica
tions.

"[Quasar] uses the techniques
that are similar to what recommen
dation systems or data mining sys
tems use to recommend movies or
items on Amazon," Delimitrou
said. "Instead of recommending
movies to various users, we recom
mend resources to incoming appli
cations."
Christos Kozyrakis, associate
professor of electrical engineering
and of computer science, worked
on Quasar as the other primary re
searcher. He wrote in a statement
to The Daily that the software re
duces the costs of cloud computing
without affecting application per
formance.

"It can help the operators of
cloud computing facilities serve
more customers and more applica
tions," Kozyrakis said. "Quasar in
creases the cost-effectiveness of

these facilities by two to three
times."
Although implementing Quasar
on a wide scale would require a
changeover on the part of compa
nies, Delimitrou explained that the
shift would ultimately make cloud
computing more accessible for
users.
"It makes it much easier for the
user because he doesn't have to
worry about how any resources do
I need, if I specify X resources will
I satisfy my performance con
straints, if I ask for too many will
my system be underutilized," De
limitrou said. "I think it can be an
easy transition."
Kushagra Vaid, general manag
er for cloud server engineering at
Microsoft, explained that efficient
ly managing cloud computing re
sources has in fact posed a chal
lenge for data centers.
"[Efficient scheduling] is a big
challenge that's very hard to
solve," Vaid said. "Usually what
happens is it's hard to understand
the nature of the applications and
how they consume the resources ...
I haven't seen anything like
[Quasar] outside of the big cloud

computing providers."
According to Vaid, Quasar will
preclude companies from initially
needing to purchase new servers to
handle more applications. He also
noted the importance of the soft
ware for companies that may not
necessarily want to use a public
cloud.
"[Big IT departments] want to
run [computing] in their own data
centers, but they don't have the
sources to be able to allocate the
resources efficiently so they end up
buying a lot of extra hardware,"
Vaid said. "That's where the oppor
tunity exists for Quasar."
Delimitrou explained that in the
near future they hope to integrate
the software with an existing sys
tem like Apache Mesos, a cluster
manager that handles aspects of
resource scheduling in addition to
efficiency.
"We are talking with them to
see how we can integrate some of
these techniques on top of Mesos,"

Delimitrou said. "It's a relatively
small codebase, and it's actually
used by Twitter and a few other
large companies so we would be
able to see the efficiency gains in a
large system."
According to Delimitrou, the re
searchers are also working on how
to handle a hybrid cloud to accom
modate situations in which a user
runs an application both on his own
machine and on a public cloud.
Quasar's primary short- and long
term goals include, according to
Kozyrakis, "scaling Quasar to cloud
facilities with tens of thousands of
servers," and, longer-term, "man
ag[ing] applications that span mul
tiple cloud facilities, public and pri
vate."
"Of course, we are exploring
ways to put Quasar in the hands of
cloud computing operators as soon
as possible," he concluded.

computing power that you could be
getting out of the machines is be

ing wasted," Delimitrou said.
Instead of asking users how
many resources they need, Quasar
asks people to specify how fast
they want their application to run.
The software then translates that
performance target into resources
based on data from similar applica
tions.

"[Quasar] uses the techniques
that are similar to what recommen
dation systems or data mining sys
tems use to recommend movies or
items on Amazon," Delimitrou
said. "Instead of recommending
movies to various users, we recom
mend resources to incoming appli
cations."
Christos Kozyrakis, associate
professor of electrical engineering
and of computer science, worked
on Quasar as the other primary re
searcher. He wrote in a statement
to The Daily that the software re
duces the costs of cloud computing
without affecting application per
formance.

"It can help the operators of
cloud computing facilities serve
more customers and more applica
tions," Kozyrakis said. "Quasar in
creases the cost-effectiveness of

these facilities by two to three
times."
Although implementing Quasar
on a wide scale would require a
changeover on the part of compa
nies, Delimitrou explained that the
shift would ultimately make cloud
computing more accessible for
users.
"It makes it much easier for the
user because he doesn't have to
worry about how any resources do
I need, if I specify X resources will
I satisfy my performance con
straints, if I ask for too many will
my system be underutilized," De
limitrou said. "I think it can be an
easy transition."
Kushagra Vaid, general manag
er for cloud server engineering at
Microsoft, explained that efficient
ly managing cloud computing re
sources has in fact posed a chal
lenge for data centers.
"[Efficient scheduling] is a big
challenge that's very hard to
solve," Vaid said. "Usually what
happens is it's hard to understand
the nature of the applications and
how they consume the resources ...
I haven't seen anything like
[Quasar] outside of the big cloud

computing providers."
According to Vaid, Quasar will
preclude companies from initially
needing to purchase new servers to
handle more applications. He also
noted the importance of the soft
ware for companies that may not
necessarily want to use a public
cloud.
"[Big IT departments] want to
run [computing] in their own data
centers, but they don't have the
sources to be able to allocate the
resources efficiently so they end up
buying a lot of extra hardware,"
Vaid said. "That's where the oppor
tunity exists for Quasar."
Delimitrou explained that in the
near future they hope to integrate
the software with an existing sys
tem like Apache Mesos, a cluster
manager that handles aspects of
resource scheduling in addition to
efficiency.
"We are talking with them to
see how we can integrate some of
these techniques on top of Mesos,"

Delimitrou said. "It's a relatively
small codebase, and it's actually
used by Twitter and a few other
large companies so we would be
able to see the efficiency gains in a
large system."
According to Delimitrou, the re
searchers are also working on how
to handle a hybrid cloud to accom
modate situations in which a user
runs an application both on his own
machine and on a public cloud.
Quasar's primary short- and long
term goals include, according to
Kozyrakis, "scaling Quasar to cloud
facilities with tens of thousands of
servers," and, longer-term, "man
ag[ing] applications that span mul
tiple cloud facilities, public and pri
vate."
"Of course, we are exploring
ways to put Quasar in the hands of
cloud computing operators as soon
as possible," he concluded.

M.S. '12 Ph.D '17 developed Quasar, software with potential to
increase the efficiency of cloud computing. The software will use
methods similar to Amazon and Netflix's recommendation algorithms.
Researchers at Stanford have
developed software that could in
crease the efficiency of cloud com
puting by eliciting more work from
the available infrastructure at
large-scale data centers.
The tool, named Quasar, uses
techniques similar to Amazon's and
Netflix's recommendation algo
rithms to determine the amount of
computing resources that an appli
cation requires to run.
Researcher Christina Delim
itrou M.S. 'l2 Ph.D. 'l7 emphasized
the problems with current meth
ods of allocating resources, which
require internal users to specify
the amount of resources needed for
their application. According to De
limitrou, statistics from companies
like Google, Microsoft and Twitter
suggest that people tend to overes
timate their needs by a factor of 10.
"If you measure the utilization
[of the current system], it's at
around 10 to 20 percent, which
means that about 80 percent of the
computing power that you could be
getting out of the machines is be

ing wasted," Delimitrou said.
