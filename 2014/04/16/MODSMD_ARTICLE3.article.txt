## Community makerspace opens at Meyer 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
Last Thursday, Meyer Li
brary officially announced its
new create:space, a makerspace
a community-operated work
space that promotes socialization
and collaboration among people
with common interests open to
the broader Stanford community.
According to Beth McCul
lough, the leader of the project,
the makerspace came about after
a 3D printer and about $lOO,OOO
of funding became available. The
space was officially opened to the
public by the end of January but
had not been rolled out until late

last week.
"We were thinking of ways to
extend [the ability to work cre
atively] and at the same time, we
had more resources available,"
McCullough said. "We had a 3D
printer and we were thinking,
'how do we integrate that more
into our service model?' One of
the things that we thought that
we could do is extend the services
that we offer to the Stanford com
munity and we coalesced around
the idea of having a makerspace."
This space is meant to be a
place for creative activity and
features components of digital
creation, like multimedia
equipped computers, scanners

and the 3D printer.
Given that many makerspaces
open on campus aren't necessari
ly public, McCullough's team
wanted to get its feet wet with
the idea of building one more ac
cessible to undergraduates.
"What we wanted to create
was a low barrier to entry so that
anyone in the community could
use it," McCullough said.
The small designed space is
now situated on the second floor
of Meyer Library but has plans to
move over the summer to a new
location in Lanthrop Library,
which will be situated in the for
mer Graduate School of Business
buildings by Littlefield Center.

McCullough also noted that
the idea of opening makerspaces
in student dormitories has been
brought up, and acknowledged
that her team has engaged in an
ongoing dialogue with under
graduates to determine what fea
tures they want to see more of in
the create:space.
"We're in early discussion
about how we can provide more
support in the residences the
idea of makerspaces in the resi
dential zone is definitely some
thing that we are thinking
about," she said.
