## Senate takes on SASA funding gap Group's emergency grant request may still require new cutbacks 
### PETER MOON DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Tuesday night's meeting of the
15th ASSU Undergraduate Senate
featured an introduction from newly
elected ASSU Executives Elizabeth
Woodson 'l5 and Logan Richard 'l5
and the discussion of various funding
issues.
The Senate began with discussion
of a bill that sought to appropriate
general fee reserves to support the
Stanford African Students Associa
tion (SASA), whose special fees re
quest garnered the support of a ma
jority of both undergraduate and
graduate students in this year's AS
SU elections but fell short of being
voted on by 15 percent of the com

"This is a unique situation," said
Senator John-Lancaster Finley 'l6.
"Lots of student groups who serve
graduate students don't apply for
joint special fees because they have
to be voted by both undergraduate
and graduate students."
"If we don't take action, SASA
will have to operate with $6,000 in
general fees and $2,000 in reserves,"
Finley added.
According to SASA representa
tives, the group contributes exten
sively to Stanford's culture. The
group recently held a cultural show
and a tribute to Nelson Mandela, as
well as collaborating with the Gradu
ate School of Business' Global Speak
ers series and Africa Business Forum
to invite guest speakers and experts
to Stanford campus.
While SASA's request for an
emergency grant of $lO,OOO will like
ly pass in the next Senate meeting,
that measure will still leave the
group $7,000 short of its initial re
quest.
Advocacy Committee Chair
Hisham Al-Falih 'l6 recommended
that SASA go to the Graduate Stu
dent Council for further support.
"SASA should ask GSC for mon
ey, regardless of whether SASA re
ceives money from the Undergradu
ate Senate," Al-Falih said.
Other senators also advised
SASA to ask other organizations on
