## Weighing the World Cup competition 
### Vignesh Venkataraman 
In a few short months, the
World Cup (of soccer, not pok
er) will begin in Brazil. Fans of
the beautiful game, of beautiful
women and of Brazilian kick
boxing will venture forth into the
wild, making the trip to South Amer
ica's largest nation to catch one of the
biggest sporting spectacles on the
planet.
In contention for the trophy are
the typical heavyweights: Germany,
Spain, Argentina, Italy, Portugal, the
Netherlands and, of course, the host
nation itself. Waiting in the wings are
the dark horses: Belgium, Colombia,
Uruguay, Russia, the Ivory Coast,
Ghana and many others. In a third
category, as perpetual underperform
ers, are England and France, two na
tions who find new and amusing ways
to debase themselves with each
World Cup. And finally, there are the
unknowns, teams who could exit with
nary a whimper or storm their way
into the knockout stages.
Somewhere near the top of that
latter list lies the United States.
Drawn into this year's "Group of
Death" alongside Germany, Portugal
and Ghana, the U.S. men's national
soccer team (obnoxiously abbreviated
as USMNT) faces an uphill battle
from the outset, as it will have to elim
inate one of the favorites just to ad
vance past the group stages of the
tournament. As a soccer fan, the
prospect of watching some of these
games is tantalizing. As a USMNT
supporter, I'm already terrified.
My terror isn't without good rea
son; Germany fields one of the
strongest squads in recent memory
an elite mix of veterans and new
comers featuring centerback Mats
Hummels, leftback and captain
Philipp Lahm, midfielders Mesut
Ozil, Toni Kroos, Mario Gotze and
Bastian Schweinsteiger, also includ
ing strikers Thomas Muller and leg
end Miroslav Klose. You could not
construct a more complete or bal
anced team in your imagination. The
only thing that gives me confidence?
We beat Germany's third-string
squad in a friendly match last sum
mer albeit just barely
On second thought, my confidence
is gone.

Portugal has a player named Cris
tiano Ronaldo on its team. You may
have heard of him, as he is one of the
finest athletes and footballers (soc
cer-ers doesn't have the same ring to
it) on the planet. The phrase "he can
put the team on his back" applies to
very few players, but Ronaldo is one
of them; I already have nightmares
about his uniquely violent running
form and his heroics to get Portugal
to qualify for the World Cup.

As if those two teams weren't
enough, we also have to contend with
Ghana, a team that has had our num
ber in recent years. In 2010, we lost to
Ghana in extra time in the round of
16. In 2006, they sent us home with a
loss in the group stages. Although I
cannot name a single player that
might be on their squad come sum
mertime, Ghana still frightens me on
a deeply psychological level. The
Black Stars are in my head.
This World Cup comes at a pivotal
time for soccer in the United States.
Under the leadership of commission
er Greg Garber, Major League Soc
cer has steadily grown in popularity
and is now looking at further expan
sion into other cities. A whole genera
tion of younger kids is becoming in
doctrinated into the global phenome
non known as soccer, through (of all
things) the insanely addictive and
competitive FIFA video game.
Club and youth soccer continue to
become popular outlets of athletic tal
ent, as the injury prospects of foot
ball, the boredom of baseball and the
steep equipment requirements of
hockey scare some folks away. And,
most importantly, there is a very
strong positive vibe around the men's
national team. With legendary player
Jurgen Klinsmann at the helm and a
strong few years of results against
CONCACAF competition, it really
does feel like there is a chance for
some magic to occur this year.
Naysayers will gripe that many of
our strongest players are being sum
marily pushed out of European
leagues back to the MLS; stars like
Clint Dempsey and Michael Bradley
have returned to the North American
continent in search of playing time
that they couldn't find in England and
Italy, respectively. The pessimists will
also argue (with good reason) that we
haven't played anyone of conse
quence yet, that our talent pool is sub

par or that being drawn into the
"Group of Death" nullifies all chances
of advancing far into the tournament.
They may in fact be right. Howev
er, there is a reason the games (sorry,
matches) are played on the field and
not on paper. Who knows? Maybe
this is the year that the United States

makes some serious noise at the
World Cup, although I wouldn't bet
on it.
What would I bet on? That Eng
land isn't winning this year- (or any
year). You can take that to the bank.

nesh Venkataraman's head, as he
anticipates the World Cup this
summer. Let Vignesh know your
thoughts on who should be
dreamed about and easily forgot
ten at viggy@stanford.edu.

wild, making the trip to South Amer
ica's largest nation to catch one of the
biggest sporting spectacles on the
planet.
In contention for the trophy are
the typical heavyweights: Germany,
Spain, Argentina, Italy, Portugal, the
Netherlands and, of course, the host
nation itself. Waiting in the wings are
the dark horses: Belgium, Colombia,
Uruguay, Russia, the Ivory Coast,
Ghana and many others. In a third
category, as perpetual underperform
ers, are England and France, two na
tions who find new and amusing ways
to debase themselves with each
World Cup. And finally, there are the
unknowns, teams who could exit with
nary a whimper or storm their way
into the knockout stages.
Somewhere near the top of that
latter list lies the United States.
Drawn into this year's "Group of
Death" alongside Germany, Portugal
and Ghana, the U.S. men's national
soccer team (obnoxiously abbreviated
as USMNT) faces an uphill battle
from the outset, as it will have to elim
inate one of the favorites just to ad
vance past the group stages of the
tournament. As a soccer fan, the
prospect of watching some of these
games is tantalizing. As a USMNT
supporter, I'm already terrified.
My terror isn't without good rea
son; Germany fields one of the
strongest squads in recent memory
an elite mix of veterans and new
comers featuring centerback Mats
Hummels, leftback and captain
Philipp Lahm, midfielders Mesut
Ozil, Toni Kroos, Mario Gotze and
Bastian Schweinsteiger, also includ
ing strikers Thomas Muller and leg
end Miroslav Klose. You could not
construct a more complete or bal
anced team in your imagination. The
only thing that gives me confidence?
We beat Germany's third-string
squad in a friendly match last sum
mer albeit just barely
On second thought, my confidence
is gone.

Portugal has a player named Cris
tiano Ronaldo on its team. You may
have heard of him, as he is one of the
finest athletes and footballers (soc
cer-ers doesn't have the same ring to
it) on the planet. The phrase "he can
put the team on his back" applies to
very few players, but Ronaldo is one
of them; I already have nightmares
about his uniquely violent running
form and his heroics to get Portugal
to qualify for the World Cup.

As if those two teams weren't
enough, we also have to contend with
Ghana, a team that has had our num
ber in recent years. In 2010, we lost to
Ghana in extra time in the round of
16. In 2006, they sent us home with a
loss in the group stages. Although I
cannot name a single player that
might be on their squad come sum
mertime, Ghana still frightens me on
a deeply psychological level. The
Black Stars are in my head.
This World Cup comes at a pivotal
time for soccer in the United States.
Under the leadership of commission
er Greg Garber, Major League Soc
cer has steadily grown in popularity
and is now looking at further expan
sion into other cities. A whole genera
tion of younger kids is becoming in
doctrinated into the global phenome
non known as soccer, through (of all
things) the insanely addictive and
competitive FIFA video game.
Club and youth soccer continue to
become popular outlets of athletic tal
ent, as the injury prospects of foot
ball, the boredom of baseball and the
steep equipment requirements of
hockey scare some folks away. And,
most importantly, there is a very
strong positive vibe around the men's
national team. With legendary player
Jurgen Klinsmann at the helm and a
strong few years of results against
CONCACAF competition, it really
does feel like there is a chance for
some magic to occur this year.
Naysayers will gripe that many of
our strongest players are being sum
marily pushed out of European
leagues back to the MLS; stars like
Clint Dempsey and Michael Bradley
have returned to the North American
continent in search of playing time
that they couldn't find in England and
Italy, respectively. The pessimists will
also argue (with good reason) that we
haven't played anyone of conse
quence yet, that our talent pool is sub

par or that being drawn into the
"Group of Death" nullifies all chances
of advancing far into the tournament.
They may in fact be right. Howev
er, there is a reason the games (sorry,
matches) are played on the field and
not on paper. Who knows? Maybe
this is the year that the United States

makes some serious noise at the
World Cup, although I wouldn't bet
on it.
What would I bet on? That Eng
land isn't winning this year- (or any
year). You can take that to the bank.
