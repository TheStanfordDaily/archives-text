# SPRING GAME DEBRIEF
## 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
At this past Saturday's
Cardinal & White Spring
Game, the defense looked
much more prepared than the
offense despite large turnover
at the positions, coaching
changes and missing contrib
utors on the defense and sig
nificant experience at the skill
positions on the offense. With
that in mind, we asked football
writers Michael Peterson, Vi
han Lakshman and David
Cohn: What position group
ing's continued development
will be the most critical in or
der for the Cardinal to be suc
cessful this season ?

Michael: Although the offen
sive line is still young and relative
ly inexperienced, the level of domi
nation exhibited by the defensive
front seven in the trenches during
the Spring Game surprised me.
Senior Henry Anderson, freshman
Peter Kalambayi and others con
tinually pushed the offensive line
backwards and forced negative
yardage plays something very
uncommon to see from Stanford's
offensive line. Stanford's ground
and-pound attack has been built
upon big, strong offensive lines in
past years and the play of the of
fensive line will be crucial to Stan
ford's success this season.

With four departed starters, the
offensive line could face issues of
inexperience. That being said, the
group taking over on the line is as
talented as they come. Anchored
by returning sophomore starter
and future first-round NFL draft
pick Andrus Peat on the left side,
the offensive line will be main
tained by Peat and sophomores
Josh Garnett, Graham Shuler,
Johnny Caspers and Kyle Murphy.
Garnett, Murphy and Caspers all
saw the field as "ogres" in Stan
ford's jumbo formation last season
and each lineman was a highly
touted recruit in the 2012 class.
There's a reason why few ob
servers of Stanford football are

worried about the offensive line.
However, offensive line success
is mandatory for the style of foot
ball Stanford plays. If the offensive
line cannot dominate up front,
Stanford will struggle mightily to
move the ball it's as simple as
that. This was clearly evident on
Saturday as the young line allowed
14 tackles for loss including
eight sacks (although the quarter
back was never physically brought
down due to Spring Game rules)
and the offense stuttered all
game long. While there is little

doubt that the offensive line will
eventually be at least as successful
as previous units, it certainly has a
long way to go to be ready for the
season. This continued develop
ment could ultimately determine
how far Stanford goes next season.
Vihan: First of all, I'd just like
to say that I don't think Stanford's
offensive struggles should raise
any calls for concern. The defense
has reloaded and looks absolutely
dominant up front while the Card's
young offensive line is still taking

time to come together. Now, with
that being said, I think the contin
ued development of the secondary
will be the most important piece for
Stanford's success. As mentioned,
Stanford's front seven looks ab
solutely terrifying with at least 10
or 11 players who can make serious
contributions; however, for Henry
Anderson and company to be able
to pin their ears back and start the
#partyinthebackfield, Stanford's
corners and safeties need to hold

Sophomore left tackle Andrus Peat (center) will anchor an inexperienced-yet-talented offensive line next
season and will be joined by four other members of Stanford's highly-anticipated 2012 offensive line
recruiting class in Joshua Garnett, Graham Shuler, Johnny Caspers and Kyle Murphy.
