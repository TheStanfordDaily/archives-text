# SPRING GAME DEBRIEF
## 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
At this past Saturday's
Cardinal & White Spring
Game, the defense looked
much more prepared than the
offense despite large turnover
at the positions, coaching
changes and missing contrib
utors on the defense and sig
nificant experience at the skill
positions on the offense. With
that in mind, we asked football
writers Michael Peterson, Vi
han Lakshman and David
Cohn: What position group
ing's continued development
will be the most critical in or
der for the Cardinal to be suc
cessful this season ?

Michael: Although the offen
sive line is still young and relative
ly inexperienced, the level of domi
nation exhibited by the defensive
front seven in the trenches during
the Spring Game surprised me.
Senior Henry Anderson, freshman
Peter Kalambayi and others con
tinually pushed the offensive line
backwards and forced negative
yardage plays something very
uncommon to see from Stanford's
offensive line. Stanford's ground
and-pound attack has been built
upon big, strong offensive lines in
past years and the play of the of
fensive line will be crucial to Stan
ford's success this season.

With four departed starters, the
offensive line could face issues of
inexperience. That being said, the
group taking over on the line is as
talented as they come. Anchored
by returning sophomore starter
and future first-round NFL draft
pick Andrus Peat on the left side,
the offensive line will be main
tained by Peat and sophomores
Josh Garnett, Graham Shuler,
Johnny Caspers and Kyle Murphy.
Garnett, Murphy and Caspers all
saw the field as "ogres" in Stan
ford's jumbo formation last season
and each lineman was a highly
touted recruit in the 2012 class.
There's a reason why few ob
servers of Stanford football are

worried about the offensive line.
However, offensive line success
is mandatory for the style of foot
ball Stanford plays. If the offensive
line cannot dominate up front,
Stanford will struggle mightily to
move the ball it's as simple as
that. This was clearly evident on
Saturday as the young line allowed
14 tackles for loss including
eight sacks (although the quarter
back was never physically brought
down due to Spring Game rules)
and the offense stuttered all
game long. While there is little

doubt that the offensive line will
eventually be at least as successful
as previous units, it certainly has a
long way to go to be ready for the
season. This continued develop
ment could ultimately determine
how far Stanford goes next season.
Vihan: First of all, I'd just like
to say that I don't think Stanford's
offensive struggles should raise
any calls for concern. The defense
has reloaded and looks absolutely
dominant up front while the Card's
young offensive line is still taking

time to come together. Now, with
that being said, I think the contin
ued development of the secondary
will be the most important piece for
Stanford's success. As mentioned,
Stanford's front seven looks ab
solutely terrifying with at least 10
or 11 players who can make serious
contributions; however, for Henry
Anderson and company to be able
to pin their ears back and start the
#partyinthebackfield, Stanford's
corners and safeties need to hold

Sophomore left tackle Andrus Peat (center) will anchor an inexperienced-yet-talented offensive line next
season and will be joined by four other members of Stanford's highly-anticipated 2012 offensive line
recruiting class in Joshua Garnett, Graham Shuler, Johnny Caspers and Kyle Murphy.
down the fort in coverage.
With senior safeties Ed
Reynolds and Devon Carrington
moving on and sophomore corner
Alex Carter out with an injury,
Stanford's secondary looked thin
heading into the Spring Game, but
the unit put on quite a show under
new secondary coach Duane Akina,
who has previously developed 28
NFL defensive backs while at
Texas. Reynolds' apparent replace
ment, senior Kyle Olugbode, looked
very comfortable in the starting
spot while a pair of converted offen
sive players— sophomore quar
terback Dallas Lloyd and sopho
more wide receiver Kodi Whitfield
showed natural safety instincts
and made some great reads and big
hits. Senior safety John Flacco also
impressed in the Spring Game,
picking off quarterback Kevin
Hogan and stopping the first-team
offense. Meanwhile, junior strong
safety Jordan Richards ar
guably the best player at his posi
tion in the country is still Jordan
Richards and looks to be the anchor
and the undisputed leader of the
unit.
As for the corners, Wayne
Lyons looked very impressive as
he recorded a team-high three
pass breakups while Ronnie Har
ris did an excellent job on the oth

er side of the field, aside from giv
ing up a 45-yard catch to Rollins
Stallworth. Freshman Chandler
Dorrell made the biggest play for
the unit and for the entire de
fense — with a pick-six off fresh
man quarterback Ryan Burns in
the first quarter. With up-and-com
ing players in Dorrell and fresh
man Taijuan Thomas and a host of
incoming freshmen not to men
tion Carter returning for the sea
son— the corners look to be in
good shape. Under Akina's guid
ance, the secondary appears to be
making significant strides in just
the few short weeks of spring prac
tice. If the unit continues to devel
op and gives the Cardinal front sev
en a chance to get to the quarter
back on a regular basis, Stanford's
defense could make the leap from
dangerous to downright lethal.

David: While I believe that
Kevin Hogan's continued develop
ment will be most critical for the
Cardinal during this upcoming
2014 season, I feel that, as a posi
tion grouping, the running backs
will have the most to prove. More
specifically, the loss of Tyler
Gaffney, who did so much for the
Cardinal in posting one of the
finest seasons from the halfback
position in recent memory, leaves
a huge void that will have to be
filled.
Furthermore, the four return
ing running backs who will com
pete for the starting role Kelsey
Young, Barry J. Sanders, Ricky

Seale and Remound Wright had
a combined total of 288 rushing
yards in 2013. This combined total
is less than either Anthony Wilker
son's (353 yards) or Kevin Hogan's
rushing yards (355 yards) from
last season. Finally, Kelsey Young's
arm injury in the Spring Game on
Saturday will cast further doubt on
a position group that will have to
execute the Stanford offensive sta
ples of running back pass-protec
tion and the power running game in
the fall.
However, in spite of the uncer
tainty at running back, there were
some positives from the Spring
Game in the performance of
Sanders. The Oklahoma City native
shined against a formidable White
defense on Saturday, notching 68
rushing yards on a mere 12 carries
for a solid 5.7 yards per carry aver
age. In addition, he continued to
show a tremendous ability to make
defenders miss in the open field
with moves reminiscent of his Hall
of-Fame father.
Thus, if Sanders can continue
his development during summer
camp, then he may be poised for a
breakout season in 2014.

Game, fighting each other for the
