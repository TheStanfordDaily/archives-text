# FINDING A WAY
## STANFORD SURGES IN FINAL INNING 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Over his previous 10 games,
Stanford baseball sophomore Zach
Hoffpauir recorded games with ze
ro hits, two hits and three hits, but
never a game with just a single hit.
On Tuesday night, Hoffpauir final
ly only picked up one hit but it
was quite a big one.
Trailing 6-5 with two outs in the
bottom of the ninth inning, despite
having gone 0-for-4 up to that
point in the game, Hoffpauir lined
a triple into the right-center field
gap, scoring junior Alex Blandino
to tie the game at 6-6. Two pitches
later, senior first baseman Danny
Diekroeger followed suit with a
walk-off single into right-center
field, scoring Hoffpauir and deliv
ering a 7-6 victory for Stanford
(13-16, 4-8 Pac-12) over non-con
ference opponent Saint Mary's
(13-22,1-5 WCC).
"[I wanted to] try to hit it to right
center," said Hoffpauir about his

game-tying at-bat. "I had popped
a couple balls up, out in front a lit
tle bit, so I just told myself to
slow down and try to hit it the
other way and it just worked out."
Hoffpauir's timely hit came in
the midst of some of the best hit
ting of his career. Since March Ist,
Hoffpauir has raised his batting
average from .172 to .292, and be
fore Tuesday's contest, he had fin
ished five of his last six games with
multiple hits. He's no stranger to
clutch hitting either, with eight of
his 14 RBIs coming with two outs
in innings.
"I think it started during spring
break," said Hoffpauir of his re
cent success. "Because of the foot
ball aspect, I don't get as much
time to work on some things and I
was able to work with the coaches
and get some things figured out.
Ever since then, I relaxed and
started to pick it up a little bit. The

into right-center field, keying Stanford to a 7-6 win over Saint Mary's with two outs in the bottom of the ninth.

hard work is paying off."
Despite needing the late heroics
to secure the victory, Stanford ac
tually outhit Saint Mary's 12 to 4
on Tuesday. The offense continued
to pick up the pace from its midsea
son dry spell, scoring seven runs
on Tuesday after posting six runs
against Washington on Sunday.
Junior Austin Slater put the
Card in the lead 1-0 early after an
RBI single scored Blandino in the
first inning. However, just an in
ning later, the first hit of the game
for St. Mary's would come on a
three-run home run by freshman
catcher Nate Nolan to give the
Gaels a 3-1 lead.
In the bottom of the third in
ning, a controversial interference
call at first base with no outs re
sulted in sophomore Drew Jackson
being called out at first, instigating
a heated argument with the um
pires from head coach Mark Mar
quess. Saint Mary's starting pitch
er Brad Nease fielded Jackson's
bunt and threw it down the first
base line, where the first baseman
couldn't handle it, causing the ball
to sail into the outfield. Sophomore
Brant Whiting appeared to score
all the way from first base and
Jackson would have advanced to
third base, but the umpire ruled
that Jackson interfered with the
catch at first base and he was
called out, bringing Whiting back
to first.
Moments later, Saint Mary's in
creased its lead after junior Darian
Ramage singled home a run. Ram
age then attempted to take second
base, prompting Diekroeger to
throw the ball down to second base.
The ball caromed into the outfield,
allowing Ramage to continue
around the bases and score on the
error, giving Saint Mary's a 5-1 ad
vantage.
"You just have to try and stay
positive," Diekroeger said. "We
made some mistakes too. I made a
big error that almost cost us the
game. You just have to stay positive
with that and trust that with our
approach if we put together good
at-bats, we will get a couple runs."
Stanford immediately respond
ed with an outburst of its own,
scoring three runs in the bottom of

the fourth inning on freshman Alex
Dunlap's RBI single and sopho
more Austin Barr's two-run home
run. Barr's home run was his first
of the season and his second as a
Cardinal.
From there, both teams' pitch
ing staffs kept the offenses rela
tively quiet. For the Cardinal,
freshman pitcher Chris Viall, mak
ing his first appearance as a reliev
er after starting seven games, re
tired all six batters he faced. Junior
Sam Lindquist dominated in his
two scoreless innings of work as
well, striking out two batters and
not surrendering a hit. The
bullpen's performance came in re
lief of freshman Tyler Thorne, who
allowed three earned runs in two
innings pitched.
After each side scored a run in
the seventh inning, the Cardinal
entered the bottom of the ninth
trailing 6-5. Blandino led the inning
off with a walk before senior Brett
Michael Doran advanced him to
second base with a sacrifice bunt.
Blandino then moved to third when
Austin Slater struck out but the
ball landed in the dirt, requiring a
throw down to first. The stage was
set for Hoffpauir and Diekroeger,
who both delivered in style.
"I was preparing for it even the
inning before," Diekroeger said.
"When I'm fifth up in the inning,
you know that if you're up it's go
ing to be for a chance to win the
game. I was taking my deep
breaths from the start of the inning
right up to the at-bat and Zach did
great getting on third so when I
was up there, I was just trying to
wait for something up in the zone I
could slap through and just get a
single."
"We've had a lot of close games,
a lot of games we could have won
that we didn't pull out," Hoffpauir
added. "If we keep winning games
like this and staying in games, I
think we will be all right. Hopeful
ly we can win a few more and
maybe put some runs on some peo
ple so we don't have these close
games, but we've got to keep
scheming wins like this."
Stanford returns to play this
Thursday as it begins a three-game
series against conference rival Ari
zona State. First pitch on Thurs
day is scheduled for 6 p.m. at
Sunken Diamond.
