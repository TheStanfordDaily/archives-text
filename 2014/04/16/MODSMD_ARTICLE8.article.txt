# FINDING A WAY
## STANFORD SURGES IN FINAL INNING 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Over his previous 10 games,
Stanford baseball sophomore Zach
Hoffpauir recorded games with ze
ro hits, two hits and three hits, but
never a game with just a single hit.
On Tuesday night, Hoffpauir final
ly only picked up one hit but it
was quite a big one.
Trailing 6-5 with two outs in the
bottom of the ninth inning, despite
having gone 0-for-4 up to that
point in the game, Hoffpauir lined
a triple into the right-center field
gap, scoring junior Alex Blandino
to tie the game at 6-6. Two pitches
later, senior first baseman Danny
Diekroeger followed suit with a
walk-off single into right-center
field, scoring Hoffpauir and deliv
ering a 7-6 victory for Stanford
(13-16, 4-8 Pac-12) over non-con
ference opponent Saint Mary's
(13-22,1-5 WCC).
"[I wanted to] try to hit it to right
center," said Hoffpauir about his

game-tying at-bat. "I had popped
a couple balls up, out in front a lit
tle bit, so I just told myself to
slow down and try to hit it the
other way and it just worked out."
Hoffpauir's timely hit came in
the midst of some of the best hit
ting of his career. Since March Ist,
Hoffpauir has raised his batting
average from .172 to .292, and be
fore Tuesday's contest, he had fin
ished five of his last six games with
multiple hits. He's no stranger to
clutch hitting either, with eight of
his 14 RBIs coming with two outs
in innings.
"I think it started during spring
break," said Hoffpauir of his re
cent success. "Because of the foot
ball aspect, I don't get as much
time to work on some things and I
was able to work with the coaches
and get some things figured out.
Ever since then, I relaxed and
started to pick it up a little bit. The
