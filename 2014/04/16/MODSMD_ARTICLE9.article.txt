## Winning streak hits four Tennis sweeps Saint Mary's 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
Coming off an emotional
weekend in which the No. 37
Stanford Cardinal men's tennis
team (13-4, 4-2 Pac-12) first
squeaked past Washington 4-3
in a highly charged match that
came down to a final tiebreaker
and then defeated No. 39 Ore
gon on Senior Day, the Cardinal
took to their home court one fi
nal time this season on Tuesday.
The match against St. Mary's
(8-10, 3-4 WCC) put their three
match winning streak on the
line. Stanford again rose to the
occasion to extend that streak to
four, cruising to a 4-0 victory
over the Gaels.

"These kinds of matches can
be trap matches," said head
coach John Whitlinger. "You
have a big Pac-12 weekend with
pretty significant wins to keep
our place in the conference
standings, and then Cal coming
up. You can tend to forget about
a St. Mary's or any team that's
in this match. Everybody's good
nowadays ... Men's tennis is so
deep now team-wise, you'd bet
ter take care of business."

After dropping the doubles
point in both matches over the
weekend, the Cardinal contin
ued to meet stiff competition in
the pairings to open the match
against the Gaels. The matches
on all three courts were charac
terized by an inability for any
duo to pull ahead without its op
ponent fighting back. Seemingly
every game stretched to deuce,

and frustrations on errors and
adrenaline on key points was evi
dent on both sides throughout.
Senior Daniel Ho and junior
Robert Stineman on court one
played a very back-and-forth
match with their opponents, senior
Joakim Norstrom and sophomore
Thomas Alexander Hunt, with nei

ther pair taking a lead of more than
two games at any point. Ho and
Stineman did a great job defending
their serve, as they were only bro
ken once and took advantage of a
key break with the match tied at 5-
5 to pull ahead for good and eventu
ally triumph 8-6.
Meanwhile, there were fierce
battles on both courts two and
three as well. On court two, the duo
of junior John Morrissey and sen
ior Jamin Ball jumped out to an
early 4-1 lead before allowing the
very vocal pair from St. Mary's to

fight back to make it 4-3. However,
Morrissey and Ball maintained
their lead throughout the match
and eventually prevailed 8-5, cut
ting short the closest battle of the
doubles matchups on court three,
where freshman Yale Goldberg and
sophomore Trey Strobel were in
the midst of a 7-7 tiebreaker after
having trailed for most of the
match before fighting back at the
end.
With the Cardinal having taken
the doubles point to pull ahead 1-0
in the team score, they didn't skip a

beat moving into the singles match
es. All six Stanford players won
their first sets, including by 6-2 and
6-1 efforts from Ho and Stineman,
respectively, after their big doubles
win. Ho would go on to dominate
the second set, cruising to a 6-1 win
over a visibly agitated Hunt and
giving Stanford a 2-0 team advan
tage. It was the second consecutive
win for Ho, who snapped an eight
match losing streak with his three
set win over Oregon on Saturday.
"I'm glad Danny has turned it
around a little bit," Whitlinger said.

"He's played some really tough
matches that have been really
close. He just hasn't gotten W's,
but the last couple he has; it's nice
to see that."
On courts one, four and five,
meanwhile, Morrissey, sophomore
Nolan Paige and sophomore Antho
ny Tsodikov, respectively, all played
lengthy first sets but prevailed,
with Paige going the distance in
dominating the tiebreak to put the
Cardinal in prime position to take
the win.
After starting slowly and gain
ing steam throughout the first set,
Tsodikov, the hero of Friday's
marathon win against Washington,
plowed through his second set with
an impressive 6-1 win to give Stan
ford its third team point with Mor
rissey up 3-1 in his second set on
court one and Stineman up 2-0 in
his third set on court six.
Morrissey, Stineman, Strobel
and Paige were all on the cusp of
pulling off the final singles victory
of the matchup, with all of them al
ready having won five games in
what would all have been decisive
sets. It was ultimately Stineman
who finished first with a 6-1, 3-6, 6-
0 victory capped off by a dominant
and efficient final set to end the
match. Morrissey had also been en
gaged in an all-out battle on court
one with Tuomas Manner of St.
Mary's throughout the afternoon,
bouncing back from a relatively
slow start to methodically win the
first set and snag a big lead in the
second set. Increasing the drama,
he let that lead slide at the end be
fore being cut short with victory in
sight.
"[lt was] tremendous. They've
been doing it all year," Whitlinger
said. "I thought it was a great ef
fort. And you know, there were
some tight matches out there. We
looked like we were in command of
all of them at the end, but some
times you can have that letdown.
And this team hasn't had it. I've
been really proud of all that."
The team will get a day off to
morrow before getting ready for a
huge conference match to close out
the season against No. 16 Cal at
Berkeley. The last time the two
teams met was in late February on
the Farm, when then-No. 9 Cal
swept Stanford 7-0. The Cardinal
will be looking to avenge that de
feat with their end-of-season mo
mentum spurring them on.
