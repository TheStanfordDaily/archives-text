## Winning streak hits four Tennis sweeps Saint Mary's 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
Coming off an emotional
weekend in which the No. 37
Stanford Cardinal men's tennis
team (13-4, 4-2 Pac-12) first
squeaked past Washington 4-3
in a highly charged match that
came down to a final tiebreaker
and then defeated No. 39 Ore
gon on Senior Day, the Cardinal
took to their home court one fi
nal time this season on Tuesday.
The match against St. Mary's
(8-10, 3-4 WCC) put their three
match winning streak on the
line. Stanford again rose to the
occasion to extend that streak to
four, cruising to a 4-0 victory
over the Gaels.

"These kinds of matches can
be trap matches," said head
coach John Whitlinger. "You
have a big Pac-12 weekend with
pretty significant wins to keep
our place in the conference
standings, and then Cal coming
up. You can tend to forget about
a St. Mary's or any team that's
in this match. Everybody's good
nowadays ... Men's tennis is so
deep now team-wise, you'd bet
ter take care of business."

After dropping the doubles
point in both matches over the
weekend, the Cardinal contin
ued to meet stiff competition in
the pairings to open the match
against the Gaels. The matches
on all three courts were charac
terized by an inability for any
duo to pull ahead without its op
ponent fighting back. Seemingly
every game stretched to deuce,
