# RE-BOARDER AT LARGE
## Gentrification and your dream home 
### Liam Kinney 
This past week, I read a very
long article about gentrifica
tion in San Francisco. I al
ways thought gentrification was
one of those distant phenomena
that happened in the abstract and
didn't merit a practical response,
but the article cut through that as
sumption right in the title: "How
burrowing owls lead to vomiting
anarchists (or SF's housing crisis
explained)."
People are literally vomiting (on
the Yahoo! employee bus, to be spe
cific) in protest of how packed San
Francisco is becoming, and of the
kind of people it is becoming
packed with. People think of gentri
fication as some old lady getting
evicted by some young money
douchebag who wants a bigger
back yard, but in fact it should be
on the mind of everyone trying to
live in the Bay Area from now until
Google goes bankrupt.
Apparently, supply (from supply
and demand) in the housing market
of San Francisco is a thing of the
past specifically, thirty years
ago. In the '7os and 'Bos, the city
was abustle with the clangor of in
dustry and the working class, so
the mobile elite took off to the sub
urbs and to other cities. The low
ered rents that the demand vacuum
caused sucked up hippies and immi
grants, picketing it into the weird,
beautifully cultural speak-your
mind place we know it to be today.
Unfortunately, these people did
their jobs too well. Since 1980, the
city's population has grown from
700,000 to 800,000. This number is
not about to stop growing, but the

denizens of The City are in denial.
The Bay is chock full of preser
vationists, and everyone has their
own reasons for preventing infill.
You might be wondering what bur
rowing owls have to do with vomit
ing hobos. You also might be won
dering, "Hey, why don't they just
build living places on these enor
mous tech campuses so there aren't
any buses to vomit on." The answer
to both comes courtesy of environ
mentalists on Mountain View's city
council. They have expressly for
bidden housing developments on or
around Google's campus in order to
preserve the city's burrowing owl
population. Yet, Mountain View is
discussing new office developments
that would bring a little under
50,000 new residents to the city, and
even more to the Bay Area.
Meanwhile, SF, which became
the way it is because of protests
and community resistance, has peo
ple protesting every single change
to anything at all, especially hous
ing. As the article points out: "Gen
trification raises the gap between
market-rate rents and rent-con
trolled rents, strengthening the fi
nancial incentive for landlords to
evict longtime tenants." It cites a
group of Mission-based non-profits
and activists who recently protest
ed the construction of a 351-unit
apartment complex, which would
only have displaced a Burger King
and a Walgreens. Every new hous
ing development, even affordable
ones, must be circumvented or
