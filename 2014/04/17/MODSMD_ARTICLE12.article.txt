# THE 						COURT AND THE CONSTITUTION
## Supreme Court to clarify limits on executing the mentally disabled 
### David Friedman Thomas Fu 
Freddie Hall is the longest
serving of the 397 inmates
currently on Florida's death
row. He does not dispute that he
committed the horrific crime for
which he was sentenced to death in
1978 beating, raping and shoot
ing a 21-year-old woman. And he no
longer is pursuing any claims con
cerning the fairness of his trial.
Hall's sole claim is that he is men
tally disabled and thus ineligible for
execution. As evidence, he points to
his many IQ test scores, the opin
ions of several clinicians and his
poor functioning as both a child and
adult.

At issue in the case of Florida
v. Hall, argued last month, is
whether this is enough. The
Supreme Court has only weighed in
on this branch of Eighth Amend
ment jurisprudence on two occa
sions. In 1989, the Court held in
Penry v. Lynaugh that the
Eighth Amendment prohibition on
"cruel and unusual" punishment

did not prohibit the execution of the
mentally disabled. Just thirteen
years later, in 2002, the Court dou
bled back on this on this decision in
Atkins v. Virginia, holding that
the practice had become so "unusu
al" and disfavored that it no longer
was constitutional.
Though the command of the
Court was clear enough under
no circumstances can a mentally
disabled inmate be executed the
Court provided almost no guidance
on how to actually determine
whether someone is mentally dis
abled. The states have accordingly
stepped into the breach and devel
oped a host of different standards
and methods. Some use multifactor
tests that involve a number of dif
ferent prongs, such as IQ, intellec
tual functioning and social history;
others rely more heavily on IQ
scores alone.
Under Florida's current ap
proach, an inmate must satisfy
three separate criteria with clear
and convincing evidence to prove
that he or she is mentally disabled:
(1) "significantly subaverage
general intellectual functioning";
(2) "existing concurrently with
deficits in adaptive behavior"; and
(3) "manifested during the peri
od from conception to 18."
Though the second, and perhaps
the third, criteria leave some room
for discretion and interpretation,
the Florida Supreme Court has in
terpreted the first prong as impos
ing a strict IQ score cutoff. Under
Florida law, any inmate who cannot
prove by clear and convincing evi
dence that his or her IQ score is

lower than 70 is eligible to be exe
cuted and cannot satisfy the first
prong; in legal parlance, this is
what is often referred to as a
"bright-line rule."
For Freddy Hall, this bright-line
may prove fatal. At a December
2009 hearing held to determine
whether he was mentally disabled
or not, he presented evidence of
past IQ test scores of 71, 76, 79, 80,
73, 72 and 69. Labeling the lone
score below 70 as an "aberration,"
the court rejected his claim because
of his inability to demonstrate that
his IQ is less than 70.
Before the Court, Hall is argu
ing that this strict cutoff does not
accord with accepted clinical stan
dards. In particular, Hall argues
that Florida's approach is constitu
tionally deficient because it fails to
account for the standard error of
measurement that informs any sta
tistically imprecise tool such as an
IQ test and thus does not com
port with the best practices of the
American Psychiatric Association
and the American Association on
Intellectual and Developmental
Disabilities. Using this approach,
IQ scores are estimated within 95
percent confidence intervals, which
usually have a spread of 8 to 10
points. For Hall, this would mean
that most of his IQ tests resulted in
estimates with a lower bound under
the cutoff of 70.
Florida has raised a number of
objections to Hall's proposed
methodological changes. To begin
with, Florida argues that the ac
cepted clinical practice with re
gards to determining mental dis
ability is unsettled and constantly
evolving. Therefore, there is simply
no "accepted" standard for it to
adopt. Florida also insists that its
approach does comport with ac
cepted clinical practice, as every
one agrees that 70 is the generally
accepted cutoff. In this respect,
Florida argues that incorporating
the standard error of measurement
would effectively raise this cutoff
from 70 to 75 unnecessarily ex
panding the number of inmates in
eligible for execution. It also notes

Larger issues are
always simmering
below when the
Court confronts the
death penalty
that its approach allows for a series
of IQ tests to be administered, as
Hall's case demonstrates, which
should eliminate any statistical
aberrations.
From a broader perspective,
Florida contends that it is simply
inappropriate to defer to the pri
vate medical community for a con
stitutional judgment of such impor
tance. If such a delegation of au
thority were made to clinicians,
Florida argues it would create per
verse incentives. After all, Flori
da's goal is to prevent eligible
death row inmates from evading
execution, while many in the psy
chiatric community may seek just
the opposite.
At oral argument, Justices
Scalia and Alito seemed to support
Florida's assertion that the med
ical community should not be al
lowed to determine constitutional
standards. At least five other jus
tices, however, appeared to side
with Hall. Justice Kennedy, often
the swing vote in death penalty de
cisions, was particularly vocal and
repeatedly questioned whether
Florida was sincerely trying to de
termine if inmates are mentally

disabled, or simply using an arbi
trary cutoff to game the system.
With Kennedy's support, Hall is
likely to prevail, although it is not
necessarily clear that he will be
deemed mentally disabled under
the new standard formulated by
the Court.
Interestingly enough, Justice
Kennedy also peppered Florida's
lawyers with questions about why
inmates such as Hall have such
lengthy stays on death row; the
last ten inmates executed by Flori
da had been on death row for an av
erage of nearly twenty-five years
at the time of their respective exe
cutions. Justice Scalia, as he has of
ten done in the past, defended
Florida by asserting that the Court
itself, and the elaborate procedural
mechanisms it has created in the
death penalty context, are ulti
mately to blame. Though collateral
to the case, this exchange neatly
demonstrates that larger issues
are always simmering below the
surface when the Court confronts
the death penalty. A sweeping deci
sion in Hall may well foreshadow a
further narrowing of those eligible
for execution in the future.
