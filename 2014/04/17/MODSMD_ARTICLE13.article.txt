# The
						SAT facelift

### Uttara Sivaram 
In the 7th grade, I was accepted
into a program that would,
among other things, allow me to
take the SAT that same year. I had
been watching my brother, who was
a junior in high school at the time,
take practice tests and memorize
hundreds of ridiculous words like
"lachrymose," "abstersive" and
"hebetude." Needless to say, I was
woefully unprepared in compari
son; I finished three practice multi
ple choice questions before getting
distracted and sneaking outside.
After all, I was twelve years old,
and the biggest concern in my life
was passing the sit-up test in EE.
The SAT could wait.

I did abysmally. I got the kind of
score you get if you skip a question
on the scantron and continue to
mis-bubble in the rest of the an
swers. And because I was an im
pressionable 7th grader, I took it
hard I didn't watch TV for the
next month because I was taking
practice tests in the hope that my
first score was bad luck. The re
sult? I got really, really good at the
SAT and really, really bad at sit
ups.

The College Board, which creat
ed and manages the SAT, has re
designed the standardized test to
make it both easier and more rele
vant for rising college freshmen.
This includes certain structural
changes: no penalty for wrong an
swers, an optional essay and a
1600-point scale, rather than the
2400-point one (which would make
my 7th grade score more impres
sive, but not by much). The new de
sign also includes an altered vocab
ulary section, which is meant to test
aptitude for much more commonly
used words. Finally, the College
Board realized that memorizing the
term "paracentesis" would be ut
terly useless for everyone except
for the few unfortunate pre-meds
who would understand it all too
well.
As for the more fundamental
changes, the SAT has been re
designed to test analytical thinking,
rather than rote memory or course
specific information. This means
more graphs, charts and texts that
require critical thinking. In addi
tion, the math portion of the test
will be extended, and will require
students to put away their calcula
tors for certain sections, emphasiz
ing analytical skills rather than
dexterity with a calculator.
Will this new version be easier?
Maybe initially, but students have a
knack for making a competition out
of nearly anything, so I have no
doubt that the SAT will readjust to
its original degree of difficulty after
a few classes of pleasantly surpris
ing high school seniors. Indeed, I
had grown quite fond of the "old"
SAT, so when I first heard of these
revisions, I was surprised, angry,
nostalgic and a little embarrassed
at the depth of feeling I had about
this piece of news. But after gather
ing my thoughts and emotions, I've
decided that these changes are an
excellent first step to changing the
way we think about and utilize stan
dardized testing.
I believe in IQ. I think that if

anything, it's one statistic among
many that describes a student well,
especially in relation to his or her
peers. And I think that by shifting
the SAT's emphasis towards ana
lytical aptitude, we're closer to
making the SAT a more accurate
measure of IQ, rather than a reflec
tion of SES or high school sawi
ness or, in my case, a portrait of
a girl who could have spent more
time with friends, and less time
comparing SAT scores with her
anonymous rivals on College Confi
dential.
It became increasingly apparent
to me, upon entering Stanford as a
freshman, that only a few principles
and skills from high school were ac
tually useful in my college classes:
QUICKLY reading and under
standing long texts, writing well
and concisely, and more than any
thing, understanding every inch of
a normal curve at least for the
sake of knowing whether you fell
above or below the mean on a test.
And the thing is, standardized tests
have the incredible power to
change curricula nationally Throw
in a section on reading scatterplots,
and you have a concerned school
board petitioning for an extra week
spent on data analysis. If high
school is (in part) a crash course for
students before they step into their
first lecture series, then the Col
lege Board is certainly catering to
those needs.
After all, these are the basics.
While college classes are tough,
they'll review everything from the
Pythagorean theorem to the
process of passing a bill in Con
gress. It's quick thinking that your
college course will expect, and if the
professor makes you use an iClick
er, then your secret inability to mul
tiply anything larger than 10 x 11,
or locate Ukraine on a map, will be
painfully apparent.
So I applaud College Board's re
vision of the SAT, as fond as my
memories are of its distant, 2400-
scaled cousin. My sister, a high
school freshman, will be taking this
newer version as soon as it's imple
mented, and I can't wait to do the
practice tests with her. Just for old
times' sake.

Uttara Sivaram would like to re
mind you that paracentesis is a
medical procedure to remove fluid
from the abdominal cavity. Ask her
for more vocabulary words at
usiv@ Stanford, edu.

By shifting the
SAT's emphasis,
we're closer to
making it a more
accurate
measure of IQ.
