## GETTING IN SYNC 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN DESK EDITOR 
As the Pac-12 baseball season
nears its halfway mark, Stanford
baseball (13-16, 4-8 Pac-12) faces a
make-or-break situation.
Sitting in a tie for 10th in the

conference with Cal, the Cardinal
have sputtered in the last two
weeks, having been swept at the
hands of Oregon State before los
ing two out of three to Washington.
The team's series win over then-
No. 10 Oregon three weeks ago
feels more like three years ago, as

the Card have gone from triumph
ing over a top-10 team to needing
late-game heroics from Danny
Diekroeger and Zach Hoffpauir to
escape with a win against St.
Mary's on Tuesday.

While the losses to OSU and
Washington the two top teams

in the conference shouldn't lead
the Card to push the panic button,
Stanford now finds itself needing
wins quickly to climb up the stand
ings and contend for the postsea
son.
Beginning Thursday, the Cardi
nal will get their chance to start to
right the ship when they host Ari
zona State (19-14, 9-6) for a three
game series. The Sun Devils come
into their series against Stanford
as winners of seven of their last 10
games, most recently with a 5-2
win over UNLV in Tempe. ASU
currently sits alone in third place in
the conference, 1.5 games ahead of
Oregon in fourth but two games
behind Oregon State in second.
For Stanford to come out on top
at Sunken Diamond, it will need its
strong pitching and timely hitting
to sync and show up in the same
game. Against Washington, the
Card never had a chance to con
tend in the first two games as
freshmen starters Brett Hanewich
and Cal Quantrill were chased ear
ly after each surrendering five
runs.
On the other hand, Stanford's
bats were the issue against the
strong pitching of Oregon State,
scoring just two runs during the
entire three-game series and spoil-

ing Quantrill's eight-inning
shutout performance with a
1-0 loss in extra innings.
Stanford will look for of
fense anywhere it can find it
— from Diekroeger and
Hoffpauir, who will try to
carry over their success
from Tuesday's game, to
leading hitters Austin Slater
and Alex Blandino, each
with a .317 average, and to
breakout performers Brett
Michael Doran and Alex
Dunlap, who have regressed
to the mean in recent weeks
but are still batting .301 and
.280, respectively.
As for the Sun Devils,
junior catcher Nate Causey
represents the most potent
threat at the plate, leading
his team with a .361 average
and a .481 slugging percent
age. Sophomore Dalton Di-
Natale is also a serious of
fensive threat for ASU, lead
ing the team with 41 hits and
29 RBIs.
On the rubber, Arizona
State head coach Tim Es
may will likely send out
sophomore lefties Brett
Lilek and Ryan Kellogg for
Thursday's and Friday's
games, respectively. Lilek
owns a 3-2 record and a 2.23
ERA, while Kellogg is a
team-best 4-2 with a 4.07
ERA.
To counter, Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess
will almost certainly send
out Hanewich and Quantrill
for the first two games. The
starter for the third game is
still a bit up in the air. Fresh
man righty Chris Viall has
held the spot for most of the
year, but failed to make it
out of the second inning in
his last two starts and was
replaced by junior lefty John
Hochstatter for the series fi
nale against Washington,
who guided the Cardinal to
its only win of the series.
At the conclusion of the
series on Saturday, Stanford
will have played four games
in five days, including Tues
day's game against St.
Mary's. Ultimately, the up
coming series against the
Sun Devils represents more
than just a jam-packed week
of baseball: It will be Stan
ford's chance to make a
move and start climbing
back into contention. With a
series sweep, Stanford can
improve to a .500 record
overall and will remain right
in the thick of things with a
7-8 conference record. A se
ries loss, on the other hand,
could lead to a long month of
May.
First pitch at Sunken Di
amond is scheduled for
Thursday at 6 p.m., with Fri
day's game also set to start
at 6 p.m. Saturday's game is
slated for 1 p.m.

Beginning Thursday, the Cardi
nal will get their chance to start to
right the ship when they host Ari
zona State (19-14, 9-6) for a three
game series. The Sun Devils come
into their series against Stanford
as winners of seven of their last 10
games, most recently with a 5-2
win over UNLV in Tempe. ASU
currently sits alone in third place in
the conference, 1.5 games ahead of
Oregon in fourth but two games
behind Oregon State in second.
For Stanford to come out on top
at Sunken Diamond, it will need its
strong pitching and timely hitting
to sync and show up in the same
game. Against Washington, the
Card never had a chance to con
tend in the first two games as
freshmen starters Brett Hanewich
and Cal Quantrill were chased ear
ly after each surrendering five
runs.
On the other hand, Stanford's
bats were the issue against the
strong pitching of Oregon State,
scoring just two runs during the
entire three-game series and spoil-

ing Quantrill's eight-inning
shutout performance with a
1-0 loss in extra innings.
Stanford will look for of
fense anywhere it can find it
— from Diekroeger and
Hoffpauir, who will try to
carry over their success
from Tuesday's game, to
leading hitters Austin Slater
and Alex Blandino, each
with a .317 average, and to
breakout performers Brett
Michael Doran and Alex
Dunlap, who have regressed
to the mean in recent weeks
but are still batting .301 and
.280, respectively.
As for the Sun Devils,
junior catcher Nate Causey
represents the most potent
threat at the plate, leading
his team with a .361 average
and a .481 slugging percent
age. Sophomore Dalton Di-
Natale is also a serious of
fensive threat for ASU, lead
ing the team with 41 hits and
29 RBIs.
On the rubber, Arizona
State head coach Tim Es
may will likely send out
sophomore lefties Brett
Lilek and Ryan Kellogg for
Thursday's and Friday's
games, respectively. Lilek
owns a 3-2 record and a 2.23
ERA, while Kellogg is a
team-best 4-2 with a 4.07
ERA.
To counter, Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess
will almost certainly send
out Hanewich and Quantrill
for the first two games. The
starter for the third game is
still a bit up in the air. Fresh
man righty Chris Viall has
held the spot for most of the
year, but failed to make it
out of the second inning in
his last two starts and was
replaced by junior lefty John
Hochstatter for the series fi
nale against Washington,
who guided the Cardinal to
its only win of the series.
At the conclusion of the
series on Saturday, Stanford
will have played four games
in five days, including Tues
day's game against St.
Mary's. Ultimately, the up
coming series against the
Sun Devils represents more
than just a jam-packed week
of baseball: It will be Stan
ford's chance to make a
move and start climbing
back into contention. With a
series sweep, Stanford can
improve to a .500 record
overall and will remain right
in the thick of things with a
7-8 conference record. A se
ries loss, on the other hand,
could lead to a long month of
May.
First pitch at Sunken Di
amond is scheduled for
Thursday at 6 p.m., with Fri
day's game also set to start
at 6 p.m. Saturday's game is
slated for 1 p.m.

As the Pac-12 baseball season
nears its halfway mark, Stanford
baseball (13-16, 4-8 Pac-12) faces a
make-or-break situation.
Sitting in a tie for 10th in the

conference with Cal, the Cardinal
have sputtered in the last two
weeks, having been swept at the
hands of Oregon State before los
ing two out of three to Washington.
The team's series win over then-
No. 10 Oregon three weeks ago
feels more like three years ago, as

the Card have gone from triumph
ing over a top-10 team to needing
late-game heroics from Danny
Diekroeger and Zach Hoffpauir to
escape with a win against St.
Mary's on Tuesday.

While the losses to OSU and
Washington the two top teams

in the conference shouldn't lead
the Card to push the panic button,
Stanford now finds itself needing
wins quickly to climb up the stand
ings and contend for the postsea
son.
