## GETTING IN SYNC 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN DESK EDITOR 
As the Pac-12 baseball season
nears its halfway mark, Stanford
baseball (13-16, 4-8 Pac-12) faces a
make-or-break situation.
Sitting in a tie for 10th in the

conference with Cal, the Cardinal
have sputtered in the last two
weeks, having been swept at the
hands of Oregon State before los
ing two out of three to Washington.
The team's series win over then-
No. 10 Oregon three weeks ago
feels more like three years ago, as

the Card have gone from triumph
ing over a top-10 team to needing
late-game heroics from Danny
Diekroeger and Zach Hoffpauir to
escape with a win against St.
Mary's on Tuesday.

While the losses to OSU and
Washington the two top teams

in the conference shouldn't lead
the Card to push the panic button,
Stanford now finds itself needing
wins quickly to climb up the stand
ings and contend for the postsea
son.
Beginning Thursday, the Cardi
nal will get their chance to start to
right the ship when they host Ari
zona State (19-14, 9-6) for a three
game series. The Sun Devils come
into their series against Stanford
as winners of seven of their last 10
games, most recently with a 5-2
win over UNLV in Tempe. ASU
currently sits alone in third place in
the conference, 1.5 games ahead of
Oregon in fourth but two games
behind Oregon State in second.
For Stanford to come out on top
at Sunken Diamond, it will need its
strong pitching and timely hitting
to sync and show up in the same
game. Against Washington, the
Card never had a chance to con
tend in the first two games as
freshmen starters Brett Hanewich
and Cal Quantrill were chased ear
ly after each surrendering five
runs.
On the other hand, Stanford's
bats were the issue against the
strong pitching of Oregon State,
scoring just two runs during the
entire three-game series and spoil-

He'll be key as Stanford looks to address its hitting woes and bounce back from two Pac-12 series losses.
