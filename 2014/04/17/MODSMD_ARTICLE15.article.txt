# FIGHTING FOR THE
## POSTSEASON 
### DAVID COHN | SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With the Stanford Softball team (25-16, 2-10 Pac-12) having
completed the first half of its conference slate, the Cardinal
currently sit squarely on the NCAA tournament bubble. As
such, it is worthwhile to consider the Card's tournament profile as they
head into the second half of Pac-12 play and the final month of the reg-

The Good
The Cardinal's resume is highlighted by last weekend's run-rule victory
over Washington at home. Currently, that win stands as the Card's only win
over an RPI top-25 squad.
However, three wins against top-50 teams from Stanford's season-open
ing flourish at the Kajikawa Classic in February also look very impressive
at this point in the season. In particular, the Cardinal's 9-1 rout of North
Carolina State in 5 innings stands out as the

Card's strongest non-conference win to date.
In addition, Stanford's 4-3 defeat of now
ranked Northwestern will also help it in the
selection process.
Additionally, the Cardinal's strong record '
at home (12-5), coupled with its 21-4 mark

against teams ranked outside of the RPI top
50, shows that Stanford has won most of the
games that it has been expected to win.

Missed Opportunities
Unfortunately for Stanford, there
have been several missed opportuni
ties to bolster its profile for NCAA
tournament consideration, as the
Cardinal are just 1-11 against RPI
top-25 teams. This includes two
heartbreaking losses to Arizona
State in Tempe, Ariz.; in the series
opener, the Card lost 16-15 in an
extra-inning thriller, and in the fi-
nale, Stanford could not protect a
5-2 lead in the bottom of the sev
enth inning, allowing the Sun Devils
to score five unanswered runs for
the win.
The Cardinal were also de
prived of the opportunity to post
an outstanding road win against
an RPI top-25 team in the Arizona
Wildcats. Once again, the Card
was unable to protect a seventh
inning lead in a series finale,
falling to the Wildcats by a score
of 5-3 in eight innings.
Finally, Stanford's loss to
LSU as part of the Mary Nutter
Collegiate Classic in Cathedral
City, Calif, prevented the Cardi
nal from picking up another signa
ture non-conference win. The Card led the
Bayou Bengals by a score of 3-2 entering
the top of the seventh inning before the
Tigers scored three runs in the top of the
frame to steal the contest.
While close one-run losses at South Flori
da and at home against Cal also hurt the <â– 
record, the defeats to LSU, Arizona, and Ari
zona State hurt more, as victories over those
squads would have provided a larger boost to
the Cardinal's postseason chances.
Bad Losses
While the Cardinal would have liked to have
beaten North Dakota State at home during the
Louisville Slugger Classic in March, Stanford's on
ly truly bad loss came in a neutral site game against
Central Connecticut State as part of the Under Ar
mour Invitational in Clearwater, Fla. Although CCSU
participated in the NCAA tournament last season as
the Northeastern Conference Champions, the Blue
Devils are only 21-12 on the season and sit second in
the Northeastern Conference standings, owning
an RPI outside the top 150.
I

ular season, since Stanford's resume to date will dictate what Stanford
needs to do in its remaining 14 games in order to make the postseason.
The Cardinal's resume reflects its bubble status, with some nice
wins, some missed opportunities and a bad loss that have all given
Stanford an RPI of 46.
