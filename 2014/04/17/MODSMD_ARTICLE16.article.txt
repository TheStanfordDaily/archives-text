# Men's golf is interesting pick to win title
## 
### Do-Hyoung Park 
Stanford Athletics has seen a
lot of streaks snapped this
year. The football team lost
more than two games for
the first time since 2009.
Women's basketball missed out on the
championship game of the Pac-12
Tournament for the first time in the
tourney's 13-year history. Women's
soccer lost at home for the first time
since 2007. After a 31-year streak of
winning Pac-12 titles, men's swimming
and diving failed to win its conference
for a second straight season.
But don't get frightened. All is still
well in the world; Stanford is easily on
track to win its 20th straight Direc
tors' Cup, and by one of the larger
margins in recent memory. With
women's tennis and women's water
polo dominating towards the ends of
their seasons, it would take a catas
trophe of monumental proportions
for Stanford to blow the 200-point
lead it holds in the standings over sec
ond-place Penn State.

While we're on the topic of
women's tennis and women's water
polo, though, another significant
and quite impressive streak, still
at stake, begs our attention: Stan
ford's national title streak. Stanford
has won at least one national title in
every season dating back to 1976-77,
making it the longest such streak in
the nation, and one that I know that
both the program and students take a
lot of pride in.
I haven't heard too many people
worrying about this streak, even
though Stanford seems to be again
cutting it quite close, because I think
that most people on this campus be
lieve that women's tennis and/or
women's water polo will bring a title
home myself included. Both of
those teams have been utterly domi
nant this season, with women's tennis
having wreaked havoc against ranked
and unranked teams alike, and
women's water polo in the midst of a
formidable streak of top-five victories.
But I'm also going to bring your at
tention to another team that has been
quietly priming itself for an impressive
national title inn this season, and will
also have a good shot to continue that
streak: men's golf.
In a sport that's about as close to
the polar opposite to the frenzied ac
tion of tennis and water polo as possi
ble, the soon-to-be-pro Patrick
Rodgers and cool, calculated
Cameron Wilson have led a young but
very talented men's golf squad to a
huge surge at the end of the season.
The team has won three of its last
four competitions and placed second
in the fourth, capped off by a 16-stroke
victory at the Western Intercollegiate
as it heads into the upcoming Pac-12
Championships.
With Wilson and Rodgers sitting
atop the collegiate men's golf world
with twin top-five rankings, freshman
Mav McNealy has finished a very
consistent season on a high note, and
other significant contributors like
David Boote, Patrick Grimes and Vi
raat Badhwar have all proved capable
of rounding out one of the most con
sistent lineups in the nation.
Women's tennis is incredibly tough
to win because of the strong competi
tion that the Cardinal will need to face
in consecutive rounds during the tour
nament. That could potentially affect a
young lineup that has been successful
all season, but has yet to be faced with
real adversity While I have an incred
ible amount of faith in the team, I also
wouldn't be shocked if the younger
players struggle a bit when the lights
start to shine a bit more brightly.
Additionally as we saw with the
heartbreaking triple-overtime loss in
the NCAA Championship last sea
son, the dynamic nature of women's
water polo and the ever-changing na
ture of matches can really affect how
matches play out regardless of how
they look on paper. Not even Stanford
is upset-immune.
With golf, on the other hand, more
wiggle room for shaky individual per
formances and a singular focus on indi
vidual performances that can't be af
fected directly by the opposing teams
could prove crucial. I think that the
consistency of both Wilson and
Rodgers, along with the experience
that both bring to the table, will prove
to be decisive, especially under the
guidance of the experienced Conrad
Ray, who last coached the squad to a
national championship in 2007.
Seeing as how both women's tennis
and women's water polo will already
have completed their national tourna
ments by then, we'll know exactly how
much pressure will be on this men's

golf team when the time
comes. I think that regardless
of whether the streak is on the
line or not, the Stanford men's
golf team will be ready to re
turn to the upper echelons of
the NCAA Championship
standings.
I just hope that it's tele
vised with Gus Johnson on the
call.

margins in recent memory. With
women's tennis and women's water
polo dominating towards the ends of
their seasons, it would take a catas
trophe of monumental proportions
for Stanford to blow the 200-point
lead it holds in the standings over sec
ond-place Penn State.

While we're on the topic of
women's tennis and women's water
polo, though, another significant
and quite impressive streak, still
at stake, begs our attention: Stan
ford's national title streak. Stanford
has won at least one national title in
every season dating back to 1976-77,
making it the longest such streak in
the nation, and one that I know that
both the program and students take a
lot of pride in.
I haven't heard too many people
worrying about this streak, even
though Stanford seems to be again
cutting it quite close, because I think
that most people on this campus be
lieve that women's tennis and/or
women's water polo will bring a title
home myself included. Both of
those teams have been utterly domi
nant this season, with women's tennis
having wreaked havoc against ranked
and unranked teams alike, and
women's water polo in the midst of a
formidable streak of top-five victories.
But I'm also going to bring your at
tention to another team that has been
quietly priming itself for an impressive
national title inn this season, and will
also have a good shot to continue that
streak: men's golf.
In a sport that's about as close to
the polar opposite to the frenzied ac
tion of tennis and water polo as possi
ble, the soon-to-be-pro Patrick
Rodgers and cool, calculated
Cameron Wilson have led a young but
very talented men's golf squad to a
huge surge at the end of the season.
The team has won three of its last
four competitions and placed second
in the fourth, capped off by a 16-stroke
victory at the Western Intercollegiate
as it heads into the upcoming Pac-12
Championships.
With Wilson and Rodgers sitting
atop the collegiate men's golf world
with twin top-five rankings, freshman
Mav McNealy has finished a very
consistent season on a high note, and
other significant contributors like
David Boote, Patrick Grimes and Vi
raat Badhwar have all proved capable
of rounding out one of the most con
sistent lineups in the nation.
Women's tennis is incredibly tough
to win because of the strong competi
tion that the Cardinal will need to face
in consecutive rounds during the tour
nament. That could potentially affect a
young lineup that has been successful
all season, but has yet to be faced with
real adversity While I have an incred
ible amount of faith in the team, I also
wouldn't be shocked if the younger
players struggle a bit when the lights
start to shine a bit more brightly.
Additionally as we saw with the
heartbreaking triple-overtime loss in
the NCAA Championship last sea
son, the dynamic nature of women's
water polo and the ever-changing na
ture of matches can really affect how
matches play out regardless of how
they look on paper. Not even Stanford
is upset-immune.
With golf, on the other hand, more
wiggle room for shaky individual per
formances and a singular focus on indi
vidual performances that can't be af
fected directly by the opposing teams
could prove crucial. I think that the
consistency of both Wilson and
Rodgers, along with the experience
that both bring to the table, will prove
to be decisive, especially under the
guidance of the experienced Conrad
Ray, who last coached the squad to a
national championship in 2007.
Seeing as how both women's tennis
and women's water polo will already
have completed their national tourna
ments by then, we'll know exactly how
much pressure will be on this men's

golf team when the time
comes. I think that regardless
of whether the streak is on the
line or not, the Stanford men's
golf team will be ready to re
turn to the upper echelons of
the NCAA Championship
standings.
I just hope that it's tele
vised with Gus Johnson on the
call.

Stanford Athletics has seen a
lot of streaks snapped this
year. The football team lost
more than two games for
the first time since 2009.
Women's basketball missed out on the
championship game of the Pac-12
Tournament for the first time in the
tourney's 13-year history. Women's
soccer lost at home for the first time
since 2007. After a 31-year streak of
winning Pac-12 titles, men's swimming
and diving failed to win its conference
for a second straight season.
But don't get frightened. All is still
well in the world; Stanford is easily on
track to win its 20th straight Direc
tors' Cup, and by one of the larger
margins in recent memory. With
women's tennis and women's water
polo dominating towards the ends of
their seasons, it would take a catas
