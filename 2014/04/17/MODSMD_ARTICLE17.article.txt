# Card take aim at MPSF
## 
### KRISHNA BASSI 
The No. 13 Stanford women's
lacrosse team (11-2, 5-1 MPSF) will
head to Southern California this
weekend for a doubleheader against
San Diego State (6-7,3-3) on Friday
and USC (7-6, 5-2) on Sunday. This
will be the Cardinal's final road
stretch of the regular season, with
Stanford needing one more victory
in its final three games to clinch a
spot in the six-team MPSF tourna
ment after an 18-6 rout of UC-Davis
on Tuesday. The Cardinal are cur
rently in second place behind Den
ver (7-0 MPSF), which must lose its
final two games for Stanford to have
a chance at the No. 1 seed.
"I liked the way we're sharing
the ball on the offensive end. Every
body is getting their touches and we
had a lot of goal scorers," head coach
Amy Bokker told GoStanford.com
after the win. "From top to bottom, I
felt everybody contributed and
that's something that's really impor
tant going into these next three
games."
The Cardinal will travel to San
Diego State to take on the Aztecs
Friday afternoon. The Aztecs are
coming off two close road losses over
the weekend, falling to Denver on a
last-second goal on Friday before
losing in sudden-death overtime at
Colorado on Sunday.
Despite her team's defeats, San
Diego State junior midfielder
Christina Ricciardulli was named
MPSF Defensive Player of the
Week on Monday after two great
performances over the weekend.
She set a new program record by
forcing 6 turnovers against Denver
while also posting 2 goals and 2 as
sists. Ricciardulli followed up that
performance with another 2-goal ef
fort against Colorado, and she leads
her team with 17 forced turnovers
and 43 draw controls for the season.
Offensively, junior attacker

Michaela Jarvis had three goals and
two assists in last weekend's games
and leads the Aztecs with 34 points
(18 goals, 16 assists) on the season.
Senior attacker Meris Walsh is sec
ond on the team with 28 points and a
team-high 27 goals.
On Sunday, the Cardinal will take
on USC in Los Angeles to wrap up
their last weekend of regular-season
play.
In its inaugural season, USC had
a rough set of road games this past
week. The Trojans had a four-game
winning streak snapped in a close
12-11 loss at Colorado, then couldn't
bounce back and fell to Denver 8-7.
Sophomore Caroline de Lyra
leads the Trojans with 35 points this
season on 21 goals and 14 assists.
Three powerhouse freshmen lead
USC: midfielder Alex Moore (31
points), attacker Annie Ruland (24
points) and midfielder Michaela
Michael (25 points). Amanda Jo
hansen tops all players with 40 draw
controls along with 16 goals, 16
ground balls and 12 forced
turnovers.
Stanford is looking to gain mo
mentum as they end MPSF play.
They will look to senior attacker
Rachel Ozer (21 goals and 11 as
sists), sophomore midfielder Lucy
Dikeou (21 goals) and junior mid
fielder Hannah Farr (a team-high 23
goals, 25 ground balls and 31 draw
controls) to lead the offense.
Defensively, the Cardinal will
lean on their experience and aggres
sion to find success this weekend,
led by the senior duo of defender
Meg Lerner and goalie Lyndsey
Munoz.

The Cardinal take on San Diego
State on Friday at 2 p.m. and USC
on Sunday at 1 p.m. The showdown
with the Trojans will be televised on
Pac-12 Networks.
