# Basketball's run not enough for satisfaction
## 
### Daniel E. Lupin 
For the Stanford men's
basketball team, the 2013-
14 season was supposed
to mark a definitive mo
ment in the direction of
the program. Athletic director
Bernard Muir placed the onus on
head coach Johnny Dawkins and his
staff at the end of last season, making
it publicly known that the Cardinal
want to be "playing for a conference
championship" and should "play well
into March on the grand stage of
March Madness." Or else.
At the end of this season, we were
supposed to know exactly what the
state of the program was; we would
know whether or not Dawkins was
the man for the future, whether this
senior class would finally live up to
the potential it had flashed at times in
the past or whether the program
would finally head in a different di
rection after six seasons under
Dawkins.
But perhaps we were fools to ex
pect such clarity given the circum
stances, because the 2013-14 Stan
ford men's basketball season was de
cidedly a mixed bag, although the
ran to the final sixteen certainly was
sweet.
If nothing else, the Men of
Maples always kept us on our toes;
just when we thought we had them
figured out, they came back and sur
prised us in one way or another.
While the maddening inconsistency
that had permeated the team's re
sults under Dawkins' guidance in
previous seasons persisted once
more throughout the 2013-14 cam
paign, it could also be argued that for
the first time, the end result finished
closer to "meeting expectations"
than "disappointment" on the scale of
possible outcomes.
The problem with the assessment
that this team met expectations is
that it relies on an exceedingly small
sample size. While it's not fair to en
tirely discount the team's regular
season successes, without which

there would have been no postseason
magic, it's also fair to say that this
season was deemed a "success" only
because the Cardinal won two con
secutive games in the tournament.
Without that, Stanford failed to
reach any of the goals the team had
set for itself before the beginning of
the season prime among them,
contention in the conference champi
onship race. The Cardinal may have
finished tied for third, but that stand
ing was shared with four other
teams. Stanford also never came
close to challenging Arizona for the
conference crown, and it ended with
the same Pac-12 record, 10-8, that it
finished with two seasons ago, when
it was seventh in the league.
Thus, we are faced with the age
old conundrum in college basketball.
When you can't have both, what's
more important: sustained regular
season results, or a deep run into
March?

Undeniably, the thrill of playing
into the second weekend of this
year's NCAA Tournament erased a
lot of the heartburn the team caused
during the regular season, perhaps
enough to mitigate some of the more
forgivable defeats the team endured
this season. I, for one, had certainly
forgotten to some extent the undeni
able thrill of having a proverbial
horse in the race that late into the
Madness, and spent much of my sen
ior spring break in a tizzy of unex
pected excitement.
The thrill of March and its unde
niable importance in measuring a
season aside, the 2013-14 Stanford
men's basketball season was, in sum,
a wholly uneven experience. Two
things of particular note, then, are
important in evaluating how we
should view this season as a fan base,
and more specifically, the way in

saved his job with a Sweet Sixteen run, the Cardinal's work is far from
done if they want to re-establish themselves as a perennial contender.
which we should evaluate
Dawkins moving forward.
The most recent edition of
Stanford basketball unques
tionably reached greater
heights than it ever had dur
ing Dawkins' tenure, but the
problem remains that these
highs were once again mitigat
ed in paid by inexplicable lows.
To further illustrate my ob
servations, let me provide
some examples. Stanford won
two NCAA Tournament
games for the first time since
2008, and for just the sixth
time in program history. Given
that 76 NCAA Tournaments
have been played, that is no in
significant accomplishment.
The Cardinal also defeated
a top-10 team on the road,
no less for the first time

since 2008, in national-champi
ons-to-be Connecticut. Count
ing their two tournament
wins, Stanford defeated four
other ranked teams during the
course of the season, and fin
ished with nine wins over
NCAA Tournament squads.
They pushed top-ranked Ari
zona to the brink, beat UCLA
for just the third time since
2008 and dismantled Arizona
State in a game that was cru
cial to the team's tournament
hopes.
Stanford placed two play
ers on the Pac-12 First Tfeam,
one on the All-Defensive
Team, had the conference's
Most Improved Player of the
Year and the Scholar-Athlete
of the Year and dominated the
league's All-Academic team.
In other words, there is a lot
this team can be proud of
when it looks back on the sea
son that was.
But once again, the results
on the court were uneven.

Stanford did not register a
winning streak longer than
four games, and still has not
won four consecutive confer
ence games with Dawkins as
head coach. The team surren
dered 112 points to BYU at
home, was thumped by Pitts
burgh on national television,
lost at Maples to a Cal team
that missed the tournament
and suffered poor road losses
to mediocre conference foes
Oregon State and Washington.
The Cardinal were embar
rassed by UCLA in the Pac-12

Tournament semifinals, failed
to come away with a win at
home against Colorado in a
crucial game down the stretch
and failed to capitalize on the
opportunity of playing No. 11-
seed Dayton in the Sweet Six
teen. While Dayton unques
tionably played well, the Car
dinal certainly did not bring
their A-game for the most im
portant contest of the season.
With what then, are we
left, given the overall outcome
of the season?
It depends on where your
expectations for Stanford bas
ketball lie. If you evaluate a
season based solely on the
team's success in March, then
undoubtedly you are satisfied
with the way the season end
ed. If, like Muir and others,
you expect the team to be able
to compete for conference
championships on a regular
basis, and that runs in March
are to be expected and not
marveled at, you are probably

left wanting more.
I, for one, find myself in the
latter camp of Stanford bas
ketball observers, if only be
cause of the sustained success
es of virtually every other ath
letic program on campus. Giv
en the resources that Stanford
has and its tradition of excel
lence, expecting anything but
the highest level of play is ex
tremely un-Stanford-like at its
very core. So while the 2013-14
Stanford men's basketball sea
son was certainly a compelling
one, I was left wanting more.
Until Maples is sold out on a
nightly basis, and until the
Cardinal is battling for the
Pac-12 crown, we as fans of the
team have a responsibility to
accept nothing less.
I think Dawkins, his staff
and his players would be the
first ones to agree with that
assessment. Stay tuned.
