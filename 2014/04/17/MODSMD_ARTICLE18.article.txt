# Basketball's run not enough for satisfaction

### Daniel E. Lupin 
For the Stanford men's
basketball team, the 2013-
14 season was supposed
to mark a definitive mo
ment in the direction of
the program. Athletic director
Bernard Muir placed the onus on
head coach Johnny Dawkins and his
staff at the end of last season, making
it publicly known that the Cardinal
want to be "playing for a conference
championship" and should "play well
into March on the grand stage of
March Madness." Or else.
At the end of this season, we were
supposed to know exactly what the
state of the program was; we would
know whether or not Dawkins was
the man for the future, whether this
senior class would finally live up to
the potential it had flashed at times in
the past or whether the program
would finally head in a different di
rection after six seasons under
Dawkins.
But perhaps we were fools to ex
pect such clarity given the circum
stances, because the 2013-14 Stan
ford men's basketball season was de
cidedly a mixed bag, although the
ran to the final sixteen certainly was
sweet.
If nothing else, the Men of
Maples always kept us on our toes;
just when we thought we had them
figured out, they came back and sur
prised us in one way or another.
While the maddening inconsistency
that had permeated the team's re
sults under Dawkins' guidance in
previous seasons persisted once
more throughout the 2013-14 cam
paign, it could also be argued that for
the first time, the end result finished
closer to "meeting expectations"
than "disappointment" on the scale of
possible outcomes.
The problem with the assessment
that this team met expectations is
that it relies on an exceedingly small
sample size. While it's not fair to en
tirely discount the team's regular
season successes, without which

there would have been no postseason
magic, it's also fair to say that this
season was deemed a "success" only
because the Cardinal won two con
secutive games in the tournament.
Without that, Stanford failed to
reach any of the goals the team had
set for itself before the beginning of
the season prime among them,
contention in the conference champi
onship race. The Cardinal may have
finished tied for third, but that stand
ing was shared with four other
teams. Stanford also never came
close to challenging Arizona for the
conference crown, and it ended with
the same Pac-12 record, 10-8, that it
finished with two seasons ago, when
it was seventh in the league.
Thus, we are faced with the age
old conundrum in college basketball.
When you can't have both, what's
more important: sustained regular
season results, or a deep run into
March?

Undeniably, the thrill of playing
into the second weekend of this
year's NCAA Tournament erased a
lot of the heartburn the team caused
during the regular season, perhaps
enough to mitigate some of the more
forgivable defeats the team endured
this season. I, for one, had certainly
forgotten to some extent the undeni
able thrill of having a proverbial
horse in the race that late into the
Madness, and spent much of my sen
ior spring break in a tizzy of unex
pected excitement.
The thrill of March and its unde
niable importance in measuring a
season aside, the 2013-14 Stanford
men's basketball season was, in sum,
a wholly uneven experience. Two
things of particular note, then, are
important in evaluating how we
should view this season as a fan base,
and more specifically, the way in

saved his job with a Sweet Sixteen run, the Cardinal's work is far from
done if they want to re-establish themselves as a perennial contender.
