# Big Slam in sight
## 
### FIONA NOONAN STAFF WRITER 
The Big Slam is upon Stanford
tennis. This Saturday, both Cardi
nal squads will close out their regu
lar seasons against conference
powerhouse Cal in matches that
will be critical going into next
week's Pac-12 Tournament.
The No. 37 Stanford men (13-4,
4-2 Pac-12) will travel across the
Bay to take on the No. 16 Bears
(14-5, 4-2 Pac-12) for Cal's Senior
Day at the Hellman Tennis Com
plex, where the Golden Bears will
recognize seniors Campbell John
son and No. 56 singles player Ben
McLachlan.
The Cardinal will look to avenge
a 7-0 loss in February at home,
which was not considered a confer
ence match.
The men's team has been on a
hot streak recently, winning its last
four matches in a row, including
Tuesday's 4-0 victory over St.
Mary's. Although the Card have
stayed strong at home with a 8-1
record, going on the road has been
more challenging this season, espe
cially against opponents ranked in
the top 20 nationally.
That being said, Stanford could
be peaking at the right time. The
team has climbed 15 spots in the
ITA Division I rankings in the past
two weeks, and has showed no
signs of slowing down against its
Pac-12 competition, including in re
cent big wins over No. 44 Oregon
and Washington.
The Cardinal will be relying on
top singles players John Morrissey
and Daniel Ho against McLachlan
and Johnson. In the two schools'
last meeting, McLachlan narrowly
defeated Morrissey in a tiebreak,
and Ho put up a strong fight before
ultimately falling to Johnson.
On the women's side, the stakes
are even higher. If No. 10 Cal (16-4,
9-0 Pac-12) wins, they will be the
Pac-12 champions and receive an
automatic spot in the NCAA Tour
nament. If No. 5 Stanford (16-1,8-1
Pac-12) takes the match, they will
end the regular season with only a
loss to No. 2 UCLA, and could be
the conference champions if the
Bruins lose to rival No. 12 USC this
weekend.
The last time Stanford and Cal
met was in March in Berkeley,
where the Cardinal held on for a 5-
2 win in an intense matchup that in
cluded rare straight-set losses by
freshman Taylor Davidson and
sophomore Krista Hardebeck.
After easily sweeping past Ore
gon and No. 45 Washington State
last weekend, the women will have
to recalibrate for a much harder op
ponent in Cal, which has now won
10 matches in a row after also cruis
ing past those two squads. Assum
ing the Bears take care of Sacra

mento State on Thursday, they will
ride an 11-match winning streak in
to Taube Family Tennis Center on
Saturday.
For their part, the Cardinal
have been nearly perfect at home
this year, including wins against
perennial powerhouses Florida and
USC, and are capable of continuing
their home-court success against
Cal.
No. 4 senior Kristie Ahn should
also be back in the rotation this
weekend after sitting out against
Oregon and only playing doubles
against WSU. She'll reclaim her
spot on court one, where she's dom
inated all year to the tune of a
team-best 25-3 record.
She'll also be teaming up with
freshman Carol Zhao, ranked No.
19, on the top doubles court, where
the pair has yet to lose a conference
match.

Zhao is another force to be reck
oned with for the Cardinal. The
freshman from Ontario, Canada is
8-0 in Pac-12 singles matches, and
has been unstoppable against top
ranked competition. This Tuesday,
her efforts were rewarded as she
rose another three spots in the na
tional singles rankings.
The Bears will come out hungry
on Saturday in pursuit of the Pac
-12 title, but as the last team to have
beaten Cal this season, the Cardi
nal are well prepared to come out
on top in the Big Slam.
The No. 37 Stanford men's ten
nis team faces No. 16 Cal at Berke
ley at 1 p.m. on Saturday. The No. 5
women's squad will take on the No.
10 Bears at the Taube Family Ten
nis Center at noon the same day.

where the Cardinal held on for a 5-
2 win in an intense matchup that in
cluded rare straight-set losses by
freshman Taylor Davidson and
sophomore Krista Hardebeck.
After easily sweeping past Ore
gon and No. 45 Washington State
last weekend, the women will have
to recalibrate for a much harder op
ponent in Cal, which has now won
10 matches in a row after also cruis
ing past those two squads. Assum
ing the Bears take care of Sacra

mento State on Thursday, they will
ride an 11-match winning streak in
to Taube Family Tennis Center on
Saturday.
For their part, the Cardinal
have been nearly perfect at home
this year, including wins against
perennial powerhouses Florida and
USC, and are capable of continuing
their home-court success against
Cal.
No. 4 senior Kristie Ahn should
also be back in the rotation this
weekend after sitting out against
Oregon and only playing doubles
against WSU. She'll reclaim her
spot on court one, where she's dom
inated all year to the tune of a
team-best 25-3 record.
She'll also be teaming up with
freshman Carol Zhao, ranked No.
19, on the top doubles court, where
the pair has yet to lose a conference
match.

Zhao is another force to be reck
oned with for the Cardinal. The
freshman from Ontario, Canada is
8-0 in Pac-12 singles matches, and
has been unstoppable against top
ranked competition. This Tuesday,
her efforts were rewarded as she
rose another three spots in the na
tional singles rankings.
The Bears will come out hungry
on Saturday in pursuit of the Pac
-12 title, but as the last team to have
beaten Cal this season, the Cardi
nal are well prepared to come out
on top in the Big Slam.
The No. 37 Stanford men's ten
nis team faces No. 16 Cal at Berke
ley at 1 p.m. on Saturday. The No. 5
women's squad will take on the No.
10 Bears at the Taube Family Ten
nis Center at noon the same day.

John Morrissey (above) lost to Cal's Ben McLachlan in a tiebreak in
February, and will look to reverse the Cardinal's fortunes in Saturday's
Big Slam. The men's tennis squad is riding a four-match win streak.
The Big Slam is upon Stanford
tennis. This Saturday, both Cardi
nal squads will close out their regu
lar seasons against conference
powerhouse Cal in matches that
will be critical going into next
week's Pac-12 Tournament.
The No. 37 Stanford men (13-4,
4-2 Pac-12) will travel across the
Bay to take on the No. 16 Bears
(14-5, 4-2 Pac-12) for Cal's Senior
Day at the Hellman Tennis Com
plex, where the Golden Bears will
recognize seniors Campbell John
son and No. 56 singles player Ben
McLachlan.
The Cardinal will look to avenge
a 7-0 loss in February at home,
which was not considered a confer
ence match.
The men's team has been on a
hot streak recently, winning its last
four matches in a row, including
Tuesday's 4-0 victory over St.
Mary's. Although the Card have
stayed strong at home with a 8-1
record, going on the road has been
more challenging this season, espe
cially against opponents ranked in
the top 20 nationally.
That being said, Stanford could
be peaking at the right time. The
team has climbed 15 spots in the
ITA Division I rankings in the past
two weeks, and has showed no
signs of slowing down against its
Pac-12 competition, including in re
cent big wins over No. 44 Oregon
and Washington.
The Cardinal will be relying on
top singles players John Morrissey
and Daniel Ho against McLachlan
and Johnson. In the two schools'
last meeting, McLachlan narrowly
defeated Morrissey in a tiebreak,
and Ho put up a strong fight before
ultimately falling to Johnson.
On the women's side, the stakes
are even higher. If No. 10 Cal (16-4,
9-0 Pac-12) wins, they will be the
Pac-12 champions and receive an
automatic spot in the NCAA Tour
nament. If No. 5 Stanford (16-1,8-1
Pac-12) takes the match, they will
end the regular season with only a
loss to No. 2 UCLA, and could be
the conference champions if the
Bruins lose to rival No. 12 USC this
weekend.
The last time Stanford and Cal
met was in March in Berkeley,
where the Cardinal held on for a 5-
2 win in an intense matchup that in
cluded rare straight-set losses by
freshman Taylor Davidson and
sophomore Krista Hardebeck.
