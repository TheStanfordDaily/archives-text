## Leadership program attracts juniors VPUE's summer program exceeds expected interest 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
The Vice Provost for Undergradu
ate Education's Leadership Intensive
program, a three-week program of
fered to incoming juniors, received
more applications than expected by
the inaugural offering's deadline last
week, according to administrators.
"There was absolutely considerable
interest... definitely more than we
thought," said Lisa Bilgen, the pro
gram's associate director.
Set to run in September around the
same period as the sophomore Arts In
tensive program, the program aims to
develop leadership skills in participat
ing students.
Bilgen said that she and Vice
Provost of Undergraduate Education
Harry Elam had worked on creating a
program focused on juniors for more
than a year. After reaching out to fac
ulty from the undergraduate and pro
fessional schools, Bilgen formed a cur
riculum that centered on building lead
ership in students.
The program is based largely on
two of the four main goals of the Study
of Undergraduate Education at Stan
ford (SUES), according to Bilgen.
Those goals include "honing skills and
capacities" as well as "cultivating per
sonal and social responsibility."
"There is a strong emphasis on
communication skills and the ability to
work collaboratively in diverse teams,"
Bilgen said. "Emotional intelligence
therefore plays a large role. I would
say also definitely giving students the
opportunity to think creatively in
terms of leading or solution finding."
Twenty-four students will be select
ed from the pool of applicants and
grouped into teams of six, according to
Albert Camarillo, professor of history
and the program's faculty director.
For each of the four teams, there
will be two consulting faculty and two
student staff members one under
graduate and one graduate mentor
ing the students.
"[The groups will] break out into
themes the environment, education,
social justice and public health," Ca
marillo said. "The groups will have the
opportunity to sink their teeth into
these fundamental issues with men
tors that will work with each group of
students and optimize everyone's lead
ership role in the group."
Beyond the small seminars and
mentorship that students will receive
during the program, the students will
also have the opportunity to receive
support from Bilgen herself if they
wish to continue their lead
ership projects over the aca
demic year, for which 10
grants will be offered.

"Whereas most other
September Studies pro
grams last only the three
weeks in September, my po
sition actually remains with
the cohort for the next two
years, helping students cre
ate their leadership pathway
through Stanford," Bilgen
said.
She noted that that path
way could include finding in
ternships or developing helix
courses or independent study
projects.
"They will create a leader
ship plan during the program
and I will work with them to
bring that plan to fruition,"
she said.
Camarillo emphasized
that the program's principal
objective is conveying to stu
dents a sense of the nuances
and the many facets of lead
ership, a sentiment shared by

Bilgen.
"Leadership is manifest
ed in so many different
ways," Camarillo said. "I
wanted to shatter the myth
that leadership is when peo
ple have strong personalities
and they do things by them
selves— that's the stereo
typical image of a leader.
Leadership is way more di
verse."
"I guess my biggest goal
would be have students come
away with a broader defini
tion of leadership than they
may have had before," he
added. "We're also going to
do a lot of work on the actual
skills they'll need so I hope, at
the end, they feel like they've
advanced in some way from
wherever they stalled."
