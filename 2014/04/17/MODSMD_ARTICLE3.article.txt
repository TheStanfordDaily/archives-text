# Stanford alumnus wins Pulitzer
## Josh Haner '02 honored for his photography 
### ANDREW VOGELEY DESK EDITOR 
Josh Haner 'O2, winner of the 2014
Pulitzer Prize for feature photography,
almost didn't accept the assignment
that would ultimately earn him that
prize.
In fact, the first time he was offered
the assignment, he politely declined.
Haner was at The New York Times'
offices, where he was a photographer,
celebrating with one of his colleagues
who, coincidentally, had just won a
Pulitzer Prize. When he saw the initial
TV coverage of the Boston Marathon
bombings, Haner jumped in his car
and drove to Boston.
"I spent 10 days [in Boston], barely
sleeping, covering the hunt for the sus
pects, the funerals and memorial serv
ices, and the city grieving," Haner
said.
As he was driving back to New
York City, Haner received a call from
one of his photo editors, who told him
they had found Jeff Bauman and that
Bauman had agreed to let them tell his
story. Bauman had become something
of a national symbol for Boston's re
silience when he was identified as the
individual with gruesome injuries in an
iconic photograph following the attack.
"I was so exhausted, I knew this
would be a great opportunity, but I
honestly didn't know if I could do [the

story] justice at that point," Haner
said.
However, a couple minutes later,
Meaghan Looram '96, at the time a
deputy photo editor at The New York
Times, called to convince Haner to
take the story.
Looram, a Stanford alumna, had
met Josh first when he was 15 and in
terning at the company where she had
taken her first photography-related
job after graduating from Stanford.
"Even then, he was a very impres
sive person. Exceptionally bright, end
lessly curious and brimming with en
thusiasm," she wrote in a statement to
The Daily.
She eventually encouraged him to
apply to Stanford and was thrilled
when he was accepted.
Haner later studied photography at
Stanford under Joel Leivick, the same
faculty member that Looram had
learned from.
"Even though we were there at dif
ferent times, I would venture to say
that both Josh and I learned as much
from Joel about seeing and under
standing photography and its history
as we did about actually shooting our
own pictures. It was an incredible
foundation," Haner said.
Looram wrote that she understood
that Haner was overwhelmed after-
