# Stanford alumnus wins Pulitzer
## Josh Haner '02 honored for his photography 
### ANDREW VOGELEY DESK EDITOR 
Josh Haner 'O2, winner of the 2014
Pulitzer Prize for feature photography,
almost didn't accept the assignment
that would ultimately earn him that
prize.
In fact, the first time he was offered
the assignment, he politely declined.
Haner was at The New York Times'
offices, where he was a photographer,
celebrating with one of his colleagues
who, coincidentally, had just won a
Pulitzer Prize. When he saw the initial
TV coverage of the Boston Marathon
bombings, Haner jumped in his car
and drove to Boston.
"I spent 10 days [in Boston], barely
sleeping, covering the hunt for the sus
pects, the funerals and memorial serv
ices, and the city grieving," Haner
said.
As he was driving back to New
York City, Haner received a call from
one of his photo editors, who told him
they had found Jeff Bauman and that
Bauman had agreed to let them tell his
story. Bauman had become something
of a national symbol for Boston's re
silience when he was identified as the
individual with gruesome injuries in an
iconic photograph following the attack.
"I was so exhausted, I knew this
would be a great opportunity, but I
honestly didn't know if I could do [the

story] justice at that point," Haner
said.
However, a couple minutes later,
Meaghan Looram '96, at the time a
deputy photo editor at The New York
Times, called to convince Haner to
take the story.
Looram, a Stanford alumna, had
met Josh first when he was 15 and in
terning at the company where she had
taken her first photography-related
job after graduating from Stanford.
"Even then, he was a very impres
sive person. Exceptionally bright, end
lessly curious and brimming with en
thusiasm," she wrote in a statement to
The Daily.
She eventually encouraged him to
apply to Stanford and was thrilled
when he was accepted.
Haner later studied photography at
Stanford under Joel Leivick, the same
faculty member that Looram had
learned from.
"Even though we were there at dif
ferent times, I would venture to say
that both Josh and I learned as much
from Joel about seeing and under
standing photography and its history
as we did about actually shooting our
own pictures. It was an incredible
foundation," Haner said.
Looram wrote that she understood
that Haner was overwhelmed after-

White Plaza, and Haner captured the moment for Volume 215, Issue 10 of The Stanford Daily while a freshman on the Farm.

many days of shooting live
news in the immediate after
math of the Boston bombing,
but that she had believed that
Haner was the ideal photog
rapher for the story.
"I really felt that he was
at a critical juncture in his de
velopment as a photographer,
at a point where he really had
the tools to cover this story
beautifully" Looram wrote.
"I told him I thought this was
an important [story] to tell, a
story that had tremendous vi
sual and emotional potential.
I told him I thought this was
a story he could really sink
his teeth into. This was a sto
ry that could help him fortify
his then burgeoning reputa
tion as a committed long
form visual storyteller."
She eventually convinced
him to take the assignment
under the condition that
he would go home and get

some rest before continuing.
Taking the assignment
Haner eventually spent 21
days over the course of two
and-a-half months chroni
cling Bauman's painful recov
ery. As a result of the bomb
ings, Bauman had lost both
his legs.
The assignment, however,
was not an easy one.
"I knew the story was re
ally good because Tim Ro
han, the reporter and I, were
inseparable," Haner recalled.
"We did everything together
and I knew the reporting he
was doing was very good."
According to Haner, the
lack of variety in Bauman's
life made taking good pic
tures difficult. Beyond a hos
pital room, a physical therapy
room and his mom's apart
ment, there were not many
places Bauman could go.
"The majority of his time
was mundane," Haner said.
"So visually, it was a very dif
ficult story to tell and, as a re
sult, I had to get really cre
ative and take more risks."

Time at The Stanford Daily
Haner's work eventually
earned him a promotion to
the position of senior editor
of photo technology evi
dence he had come a long
way from his days as the
photo editor at The Daily.
"I dove right in at The
Daily and after the second
quarter, the photo editor de
cided he was done being the
head photo editor and asked
me, a freshman, to take
over," Haner said.
It was at The Daily that
Haner chronicled the Stan
ford Powwow, his first docu
mentary-style photography
project the type of proj
ect from which he would
eventually earn a Pulitzer
Prize.

"I photographed the
Powwow my freshman year
and took some really color
ful, graphic pictures that I
thought were really pretty,"
Haner said. "It later dawned
on me, though, that those
pictures were very easy pic
tures to make and just fur
thered the stereotypes of

the Powwow."
"The next year, a group
of three of us spent a long
time researching and trying
to find families that would
allow us to follow them
around," he added. "That
was my first documentary
project."
Haner, who was responsi
ble for purchasing The Dai
ly's first digital camera, de
scribed his time at The Dai
ly as impactful.
"The Daily taught me
dedication," he recalled.
"Everyone was there be
cause they loved journalism.
Working on the documen
tary project about the Stan
ford Powwow was integral
for me to realize that... we
needed to look at a bigger
story"

"When I see my pictures
on the front page of The
New York Times, it reminds
me of my pictures on the
front page of The Stanford
Daily," Haner concluded.
