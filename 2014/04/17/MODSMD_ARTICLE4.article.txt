### NIKHITA OBEEGADOO STAFF WRITER 
On Wednesday evening, Khaled
Hosseini, author of "The Kite Runner,"
spoke at Stanford as part of the School
of Medicine's "Medicine and the Muse"
renewal-themed symposium.
In her opening remarks for the
event, Professor of Surgery Rebecca
Smith-Coggins emphasized the need
for "creativity" in order to "see the
world anew," especially in the field of
medicine.
The symposium featured numerous
student performances dance, spo
ken word, piano and opera and art
work. Its focal point, however, was the
conversation between Hosseini, author
of three international bestsellers ("The
Kite-Runner," "A Thousand Splendid
Suns" and "And the Mountains
Echoed") and Paul Costello, chief com

munications officer for the School of
Medicine.
Like many other student attendees,
Ghena Alhanaee and Sarah Alsaif, both
masters students in energy resources
engineering, learned about the event
through email. Both said they attended
for one reason: "Khaled Hosseini."
Hamshika Chandrasekar, one of the
medical students involved with the or
ganization of the event, confirmed that
publicity was restricted to email be
cause they already expected a "huge in
terest" due to Mr. Hosseini's presence,
which event organizers had been trying
to obtain for several years.
Indeed, a queue formed well before
the doors opened at 5:00 p.m. During
the event, numerous attendees found
themselves either standing or watching
from the overflow room.
The talk began with general themes
of international interest and then pro
gressed to discussions about writing
and questions from the audience.
Hosseini expressed his hopes for a
new beginning for Afghanistan. He
highlighted the importance of the April

5 elections in showcasing the "more
complex" reality of the country, which
is now struggling with "uncertainty,"
"anxiety" and "a fear of abandonment."
He drew attention to the "very
young population" of Afghanistan 65
percent of the country is under the age
of 25 and the reality that that youth
ful population hold up Silicon Valley's
entrepreneurs as heroes rather than
the war heroes of a past era. According
to Hosseini, they are less interested in
the past and more interested in justice,
women's rights and democracy. He em
phasized, however, that what happens
next will depend on security.
"If there's a civil war, all bets are
off," Hosseini said.
Hosseini also elaborated on his re
cent opinion piece in The New York
Times about the "massive crisis" in
Syria and emphasized the need to look
beyond national lines and "stand in hu
man solidarity."
Hosseini gave a brief account of his
growth as an author from a young
boy listening to the "cadences and
rhythms," to a fifteen-year-old
"stranger in a strange land" who
could barely speak any English, to
finally being a practicing physician.
Some of the themes he ad
dressed along the way were memo

ry, family relationships, the inter
play between medicine and writing
in his life, displacement and the
process of writing.
He expressed hope that his
writing had made Afghanistan a
"more human place" for his read
ers and allowed them to "climb
over the wall of their own lives" in
order to explore what lay beyond.
