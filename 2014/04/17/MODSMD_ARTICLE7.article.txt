## Ram's Head reimagines 'Les Mis' 
### ATUSSA HAMAMOTO MOHTASHAM 
The Ram's Head Theatri
cal Society's production of
Victor Hugo's beloved "Les
Miserables" reimagines the
musical by extending the
theater to the audience and
beyond the stage. Memorial
Auditorium was carefully
decorated to resemble a 19th
century opera house, and
throughout the play actors
performed on and off the
stage, many times blurring
the line between stage and
audience.
The production included a
special immersive reception
called the Opera Going Ex
perience Project. Half an
hour before the show began,
actors dressed as 19th centu
ry operagoers swept into a
courtyard. Ladies in dresses
trimmed with lace and
adorned with satin ribbons
clustered together in groups,
gossiping while fanning their
powdered faces. Men
dressed as the bourgeoisie
stood tweaking their musta
chios or smoking cigars
while discussing politics. Au
dience members were free to
weave through the actors,
stopping to listen in on a con
versation or admire cos
tumes. Candles placed in
white paper bags lined the
courtyard, shedding a soft
glow on the scene.

A stone corridor connect
ed the courtyard to Memori
al Auditorium, which in
keeping with the setting of a
19th century Parisian opera
house featured thick vel
vet drapery adorning the
stage and even an orchestra
pit. The bourgeois operago
ers from the courtyard even
tually entered the auditori
um and took their seats
amongst the audience.
This production achieved
a strong connection between
the audience and the action

on stage. In the opening
scene, prisoners formed two
lines in the aisles of the seat
ing area, crying forth their
lamentations while Javert
stood hawk-like on the stage.
A smaller stage protruded
from the main stage where
actors delivered their solilo
quies in close proximity to
the audience. The audience
was able to see the actor's
expressions and better feel
the presence of Cossette's
misery, Eponine's heart
break, Javier's horrifying
disillusionment and Jean
Valjean's steadfast faith.
There was also a live orches
tra, which underscored the
actors' powerful voices.
Beautiful set designs, cos
tumes and a masterful use of
lighting also enhanced the
emotional involvement of the
viewers. Large wooden box
es were arranged in different
ways throughout the play, al
lowing for smooth transi
tions between scenes. Sets
were placed on a rotating
floor, shifting the audience's
perspective to provide opti
mal views. A diversity of in
tricate costumes were used.
Twinkling lights were
draped in the background as
Javier delivered his "Stars"
soliloquy. Brilliant flashes il-

luminated Jean Valjean run
ning frantically in the tun
nels, searching for away out.
An eerie bluish light fell up
on the corpses scattered on
the barricades.

The play ended again
with the actors performing
off-stage in the audience. Ac
tors moved from all corners
of the auditorium, eventually
coalescing on stage where
they triumphantly per
formed the famous finale,
"Do You Hear the People
Sing." Watching the actors
move around and sing
amongst the audience in the
final scene completed the in
tended emotional impact of
the play.
This innovative immer
sive take on "Les Miser
ables" frequently placed the
viewer at an interesting in
tersection between emotion
al involvement and a con
sciousness of his place as a
viewer. The show immersed
the audience in the world of
Victor Hugo, allowing for a
deeper engagement with the
heart-rending emotions of
the play that make us return
to it time and time again.
