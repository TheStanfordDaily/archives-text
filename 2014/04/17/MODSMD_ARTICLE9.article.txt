## OUTSIDE THE BUBBLE Democracy after America: war, Islamism and elections in Iraq and Afghanistan 
### James Bradbury 
Interesting and important elec
tions are piling up this spring,
but few have quite as much rid
ing on their success as those in the
two countries most ravaged by the
War on Terror. But the Afghan
presidential election, whose first
round took place two weekends
ago, and the Iraqi parliamentary
vote set for the end of April, are
more than just crucial milestones in
the countries' recoveries from more
than a decade of war: They also
represent two of the best opportu
nities left for a political defeat of
terror itself.

The idea of terrorism always
consists in a rejection of politics; in
the Islamic context in particular,
terrorism is conceived in opposition
to political Islam. Concurrent with
(infuriating) Western arguments
over whether the Middle East is
"not yet ready" or even "culturally
incompatible" with democracy are
lively debates between and among
Islamist movements over the role
that democracy can play in achiev
ing Islamic government.

Much as conservative Soviet
leaders (rightly) concluded that the
introduction of parliamentary
democracy would rob the Commu
nist Party of its revolutionary claim
to mass sovereignty and thus ulti
mately of its power, hardline Is
lamist theorists have questioned

whether a democratic political
process can serve as a foundation
for a state that places sovereignty
with Allah and Islamic law.
Ever since the handful of Is
lamist political parties of the first
half of the 20th century lost out to
Western pressure during the Cold
War, those same hardliners have
kept a consistent line: Democracy
will destroy Islam, and so the
forces of Islam must fight as al-
Qaida in Iraq leader Abu Mus'ab al-
Zarqawi said in 2005, in response to
President Bush's freedom agenda
speech: "A bitter war against the
principle of democracy and all
those who seek to enact it."

As the West's favorite option of
stable, secular dictatorships (mak
ing the issue moot) becomes in
creasingly untenable, the question
of politics or militancy has reassert
ed itself again and again, with only
one consistent result: Whenever
and wherever the question is decid
ed by force, those who advocate
force inevitably have the upper
hand.

And so the wars against terror
drag on, as the conflict itself is
stacked towards the side that
wants to fight. The elections in
Afghanistan and Iraq matter so
much because they force a refram
ing of this conflict: They force
every faction and every leader
even or perhaps especially those
which boycott the elections to be
a political actor, just as war forces
every party to be a military actor.
Although no members were on
the ballot, the Afghan Taliban's po
litical position was clear. They an
nounced before the election that
they had "a specific military plan
for the election" namely, "to at
tack the security forces deployed
for election security and the elec
tion materials." As if it weren't
clear enough already, the
spokesman reiterated that "we
have warned the people [... ] not to
participate in the election."
Their failure was military, yes
not a single large-scale assault
was successful but since the
people of Afghanistan spurned the
Taliban's demands to stay home, it
was also a failure of a political plat
form.

In Iraq, political Islam is com
peting with not one but two alter
native conceptions of the Islamist
project. One is terrorism: The mili
tant Sunni group once known as al-
Qaida in Iraq (AQI) has been dis
owned by central al-Qaida, and
now, as the Islamic State of Iraq
and al-Sham (ISIS), forms the
most extreme faction in the Syrian
opposition and controls several
cities in Iraq's Anbar province.
Like the Afghan Taliban, ISIS aims
to sabotage the upcoming Iraqi
elections, distributing leaflets in
Anbar to warn the public against
participation.

The other is the theocratic ideal
of wilayat al-faqih, the
"guardianship of the jurist," that
underlies the Iranian political sys
tem, under which sovereign power
is vested in a single (Shi'a) ayatol
lah, who manages and overrules
the decisions of democratically
elected leaders. In contrast, and
despite Iranian pressure, Iraqi
Shi'a political parties have chosen a
more pluralist relationship with the
ayatollahs that reside in their coun
try. Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani,
the highest-ranking Shi'a jurist in

Iraq, has been careful to endorse
the election itself without standing
behind any one party or leader.

Political Islam faces setbacks
around the region from the col
lapse of Western support in Gaza a
decade ago after highly anticipated
elections brought to power a party
that endorsed terrorism, to the fall
of the Muslim Brotherhood in
Egypt and threats to AKP rule in
Turkey but it remains the only
credible alternative in the Middle
East to the autocracy and misrule
of the 20th century.
Every election in a country riv
en by conflict is an opportunity for
democracy to prove itself capable
of the most difficult demand that
can be placed on it an opportuni
ty, that is, to prove that electoral
politics can be a substitute for war.
By any purely institutional ac
count, Afghanistan and Iraq are
not model democracies. But no
body has fought for democracy
harder, has endured more for its
sake or understands more deeply
why it matters.

Every election in a country riv
en by conflict is an opportunity for
democracy to prove itself capable
of the most difficult demand that
can be placed on it an opportuni

politics can be a substitute for war.
By any purely institutional ac
count, Afghanistan and Iraq are
not model democracies. But no
body has fought for democracy
harder, has endured more for its
sake or understands more deeply
why it matters.

Interesting and important elec
tions are piling up this spring,
but few have quite as much rid
ing on their success as those in the
two countries most ravaged by the
War on Terror. But the Afghan
presidential election, whose first
round took place two weekends
ago, and the Iraqi parliamentary
vote set for the end of April, are
more than just crucial milestones in
the countries' recoveries from more
than a decade of war: They also
represent two of the best opportu
nities left for a political defeat of
terror itself.

The idea of terrorism always
consists in a rejection of politics; in
the Islamic context in particular,
terrorism is conceived in opposition
to political Islam. Concurrent with
(infuriating) Western arguments
over whether the Middle East is
"not yet ready" or even "culturally
incompatible" with democracy are
lively debates between and among
Islamist movements over the role
that democracy can play in achiev
ing Islamic government.

Much as conservative Soviet
leaders (rightly) concluded that the
introduction of parliamentary
democracy would rob the Commu
nist Party of its revolutionary claim
to mass sovereignty and thus ulti
mately of its power, hardline Is
lamist theorists have questioned

whether a democratic political
process can serve as a foundation
for a state that places sovereignty
with Allah and Islamic law.
Ever since the handful of Is
lamist political parties of the first
half of the 20th century lost out to
Western pressure during the Cold
War, those same hardliners have
kept a consistent line: Democracy
will destroy Islam, and so the
forces of Islam must fight as al-
Qaida in Iraq leader Abu Mus'ab al-
Zarqawi said in 2005, in response to
President Bush's freedom agenda
speech: "A bitter war against the
principle of democracy and all
those who seek to enact it."

As the West's favorite option of
stable, secular dictatorships (mak
ing the issue moot) becomes in
creasingly untenable, the question
of politics or militancy has reassert
ed itself again and again, with only
one consistent result: Whenever
and wherever the question is decid
ed by force, those who advocate
force inevitably have the upper
hand.

And so the wars against terror
drag on, as the conflict itself is
stacked towards the side that
wants to fight. The elections in
Afghanistan and Iraq matter so
much because they force a refram
ing of this conflict: They force
every faction and every leader
even or perhaps especially those
which boycott the elections to be
a political actor, just as war forces
every party to be a military actor.
Although no members were on
the ballot, the Afghan Taliban's po
litical position was clear. They an
nounced before the election that
they had "a specific military plan
for the election" namely, "to at
tack the security forces deployed
for election security and the elec
tion materials." As if it weren't
clear enough already, the
spokesman reiterated that "we
have warned the people [... ] not to
participate in the election."
Their failure was military, yes
not a single large-scale assault
was successful but since the
people of Afghanistan spurned the
Taliban's demands to stay home, it
was also a failure of a political plat
form.

In Iraq, political Islam is com
peting with not one but two alter
native conceptions of the Islamist
project. One is terrorism: The mili
tant Sunni group once known as al-
Qaida in Iraq (AQI) has been dis
owned by central al-Qaida, and
now, as the Islamic State of Iraq
and al-Sham (ISIS), forms the
most extreme faction in the Syrian
opposition and controls several
cities in Iraq's Anbar province.
Like the Afghan Taliban, ISIS aims
to sabotage the upcoming Iraqi
elections, distributing leaflets in
Anbar to warn the public against
participation.

The other is the theocratic ideal
of wilayat al-faqih, the
"guardianship of the jurist," that
underlies the Iranian political sys
tem, under which sovereign power
is vested in a single (Shi'a) ayatol
lah, who manages and overrules
the decisions of democratically
elected leaders. In contrast, and
despite Iranian pressure, Iraqi
Shi'a political parties have chosen a
more pluralist relationship with the
ayatollahs that reside in their coun
try. Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani,
the highest-ranking Shi'a jurist in

Iraq, has been careful to endorse
the election itself without standing
behind any one party or leader.

Political Islam faces setbacks
around the region from the col
lapse of Western support in Gaza a
decade ago after highly anticipated
elections brought to power a party
that endorsed terrorism, to the fall
of the Muslim Brotherhood in
Egypt and threats to AKP rule in
Turkey but it remains the only
credible alternative in the Middle
East to the autocracy and misrule
of the 20th century.
