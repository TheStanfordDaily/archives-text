## OUTSIDE THE BUBBLE Democracy after America: war, Islamism and elections in Iraq and Afghanistan 
### James Bradbury 
Interesting and important elec
tions are piling up this spring,
but few have quite as much rid
ing on their success as those in the
two countries most ravaged by the
War on Terror. But the Afghan
presidential election, whose first
round took place two weekends
ago, and the Iraqi parliamentary
vote set for the end of April, are
more than just crucial milestones in
the countries' recoveries from more
than a decade of war: They also
represent two of the best opportu
nities left for a political defeat of
terror itself.

The idea of terrorism always
consists in a rejection of politics; in
the Islamic context in particular,
terrorism is conceived in opposition
to political Islam. Concurrent with
(infuriating) Western arguments
over whether the Middle East is
"not yet ready" or even "culturally
incompatible" with democracy are
lively debates between and among
Islamist movements over the role
that democracy can play in achiev
ing Islamic government.

Much as conservative Soviet
leaders (rightly) concluded that the
introduction of parliamentary
democracy would rob the Commu
nist Party of its revolutionary claim
to mass sovereignty and thus ulti
mately of its power, hardline Is
lamist theorists have questioned

whether a democratic political
process can serve as a foundation
for a state that places sovereignty
with Allah and Islamic law.
Ever since the handful of Is
lamist political parties of the first
half of the 20th century lost out to
Western pressure during the Cold
War, those same hardliners have
kept a consistent line: Democracy
will destroy Islam, and so the
forces of Islam must fight as al-
Qaida in Iraq leader Abu Mus'ab al-
Zarqawi said in 2005, in response to
President Bush's freedom agenda
speech: "A bitter war against the
principle of democracy and all
those who seek to enact it."

As the West's favorite option of
stable, secular dictatorships (mak
ing the issue moot) becomes in
creasingly untenable, the question
of politics or militancy has reassert
ed itself again and again, with only
one consistent result: Whenever
and wherever the question is decid
ed by force, those who advocate
force inevitably have the upper
hand.

And so the wars against terror
drag on, as the conflict itself is
stacked towards the side that
wants to fight. The elections in
Afghanistan and Iraq matter so
much because they force a refram
