# Big test awaits Card at Big Splash

### CARLIE TENENBAUM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This Saturday will mark the final game
of another stellar Stanford women's water
polo regular season. Currently 19-1 and
ranked first in the nation, the Cardinal have
made themselves the team to beat once
again heading into the postseason tourna
ments. Coming off of an impressive romp
against Cal State-Bakersfield this past week

end, Stanford will have all the momentum
on their side when they face No. 4 Cal on
Saturday.
John Tanner's squad sits atop the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF),
and will enter its conference tournament as
the number-one seed. It is undefeated in
conference play, with the unblemished
record preserved by a nail-biting 9-8 victory
against then-No. 2 UCLA last Friday. With
the top seed already wrapped up, there's

less pressure on the Cardinal to perform for
sure, but this match will also be critical to
both ensure momentum and continued top
standing heading into the postseason.
Cal has also turned in a good season,
and is ranked fourth in the MPSF and the
country behind Stanford, USC and UCLA,
respectively. At 17-6 this season, Cal has
been dominant outside of conference play,

holding the Bears to eight goals while collecting eight saves. Her play in net will be key to Stanford's postseason push.
