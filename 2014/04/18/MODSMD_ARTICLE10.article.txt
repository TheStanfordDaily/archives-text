# Big test awaits Card at Big Splash
## 
### CARLIE TENENBAUM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This Saturday will mark the final game
of another stellar Stanford women's water
polo regular season. Currently 19-1 and
ranked first in the nation, the Cardinal have
made themselves the team to beat once
again heading into the postseason tourna
ments. Coming off of an impressive romp
against Cal State-Bakersfield this past week

end, Stanford will have all the momentum
on their side when they face No. 4 Cal on
Saturday.
John Tanner's squad sits atop the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF),
and will enter its conference tournament as
the number-one seed. It is undefeated in
conference play, with the unblemished
record preserved by a nail-biting 9-8 victory
against then-No. 2 UCLA last Friday. With
the top seed already wrapped up, there's

less pressure on the Cardinal to perform for
sure, but this match will also be critical to
both ensure momentum and continued top
standing heading into the postseason.
Cal has also turned in a good season,
and is ranked fourth in the MPSF and the
country behind Stanford, USC and UCLA,
respectively. At 17-6 this season, Cal has
been dominant outside of conference play,

but they have struggled within the MPSF,
losing to UCLA and USC twice, as well as
Stanford once already this season.
In their previous faceoff, the Card best
ed the Golden Bears 14-8 at the UC-Irvine
Invitational. Looking for another monster
game against Cal will be sophomore and
2012 Olympic gold medalist Maggie Stef
fens. In the February meeting, Steffens net
ted four goals, pushing Stanford to a 9-4 half
time lead they would never relinquish. Cal
got two goals apiece from freshmen Roser
farrago and freshman Anna Illes, so Stan
ford's defense will have to work hard to keep
those two out of shooting range in order to
beat Cal. The freshman duo is promising for
Cal and has kept them in the NCAA hunt
this season.

On the other end of the pool, Stanford's
14 goals in that last meeting came from sev
en different players, a result indicative of
how their entire season has gone on offense.
The diversity of their attack has provided the
Cardinal with the depth that's been pivotal
to their successful campaign. The ability to
rotate lineups and maintain productivity has
helped the Cardinal stay fresh for the dura
tion of a long season.
Coming off a huge game against UCLA
with a resounding seven saves, goalkeeper
Gabby Stone will be looking to ride the mo
mentum into another impressive game in
net against Cal.
This upcoming match on Saturday will
be a special one. Not only is Stanford eyeing
its 20th win of the season but it's also Senior
Night for the Cardinal. This year's team has
five seniors Annika Dries, Kaley Dodson,
Kaitlyn Lo, Lexie Ross and Kelsey Suggs

whose leadership has been crucial to Stan
ford's success this year. Though this will be
their final regular season game, it certainly
doesn't signal the end of their Stanford wa
ter polo careers, as the MPSF Tournament is
slated to start April 26.
Courtesy of its top position in the MPSF
regular season standings, Stanford will re
ceive a first-round bye in the MPSF playoffs
once tournament play starts.
The top-five duel to close out the season
for Stanford will begin at 5 p.m. at the Avery
Aquatics Center.
