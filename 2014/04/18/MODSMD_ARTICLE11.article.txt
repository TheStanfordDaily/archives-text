## Stanford aims to end NCAA drought 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
The No. 10 Stanford women's gymnas
tics team will set its sights on the first na
tional title in program history when it kicks
off competition at the NCAA Champi

onships today in Birmingham, Ala., with the
semifinals starting in the morning before the
Super Six team finals take place tomorrow.

It will be the seventh time in the last
eight years that Stanford will compete at the
NCAA Championships, with the Cardinal
having advanced to this year's meet after

one of the strongest performances of their
season at the NCAA Baton Rouge Regional
two weekends ago. At that meet, the Cardi
nal tied their season high with a 197.275 to
finish second and advance along with first
place LSU, which netted the highest national
team score at that point in the season with a
198.325.

The third-ranked Tigers will again face
off against the Cardinal at this meet, which
will also draw No. 2 Oklahoma, No. 6 Geor
gia, No. 7 Michigan and No. 11 Illinois as
part of their semifinal. The top three teams
will advance to the finals tomorrow.

Although the Cardinal are the second
lowest seed in their semifinal, they have had
a relatively successful track record against the
top teams in the nation this season, owning
three wins against top-10 teams. In addition,
having averaged 196.400 in its meets this
season and having broken 197.000 in each of
its last two, Stanford will be in good shape to
keep up with the semifinal teams. However,
it will need to do more and kick it up an ad
ditional notch in order to not just keep up but
also excel against its tough opponents, which
are all capable of scoring in the high-197
range and even above 198.000, as both Okla
homa and LSU have done this season.

Stanford is also familiar with taking a dou
ble-digit seed into the Championships, as it al
so competed in the 2012 NCAA Champi
onships as a No. 10 seed and finished in sec
ond in the semifinals en route to a fourth-place
national finish in the Super Six, using the high
est NCAA Championship scores in program
history in the vault, bars and beam to do so.
The Cardinal will be looking to avoid the
disappointment of last season, when they also
finished second at their regional before fin
ishing in last place overall at the NCAA Cham
pionships with a disappointing 194.700 in
the semifinals.

Junior Samantha Shapiro and senior
Krishna Vaculik will be looking to replicate
twin 9.950 scores in the bars at the regional
competition two weeks ago in order to help
propel the Cardinal past Georgia, Oklahoma
and LSU, which all rank top-five in the nation
in the event.

Meanwhile, LSU and Oklahoma are the
nation's two best teams in the vault, meaning
that sophomore Melissa Chuang and Pac-12
Freshman of the Year Nicolette McNair, who
tied atop Stanford's squad with twin seventh
place finishes at the regional competition,
will need to aim for even greater heights in
the event.

Senior Shona Morgan and junior Rebec
ca Wing led the way for the Cardinal at the re

gional on beam with their 9.925 scores, and
along with senior Amanda Spinner, they will
be looked on to lead Stanford to build on its
49.450 at the regional and take down two of
the better beam teams in the nation in Okla
homa and LSU.
The element of its meet that Stanford
will need to have a great day in will be on the
floor, in which Stanford is ranked outside of
the top 20 nationally, having averaged just
48.973 in the event this season. The Card re
bounded nicely with an encouraging 49.325
at the regional, with all of the gymnasts scor
ing 9.850 or higher to push Stanford into the
floor at the NCAAs on a high note.
Vaculik, who has competed in the all
around for Stanford throughout the season,

posted a season high of 39.600 and will need
to emulate that performance or exceed it
in order to keep up with other very talent
ed all-around gymnasts at the semifinal, in
cluding LSU's Rheagan Courville, who has
had a strong and consistent season that has
manifested with the second-highest average
in the nation.

Although Stanford will be facing stiff
competition in the semifinals, it has the ex
perience and the talent necessary to square
off against its opposition and make another
run into the Super Six. The first session will
kick off at 11 a.m. today.

Freshman Nicolette McNair (above) will need an excellent performance in the vault routine if
Stanford is to reverse its recent fortunes at the NCAA Championships. The squad has qualified
for the Super Six in seven out of the last eight years but has never won the team title.
