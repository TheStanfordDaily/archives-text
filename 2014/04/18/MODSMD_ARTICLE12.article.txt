# NBA Playoffs need a fast-forward button
## 
### Michael Peterson 
This Saturday, the NBA Playoffs will
tip off with 16 teams vying for the
elusive goal of winning an NBA
Championship. But hold on, folks,
because we won't see a winner
crowned for another two months, with the
NBA Finals potentially ending in mid-June.
After an 82-game regular season, a champi
onship-winning team could have to play in 28
more games to win an NBA Finals if each playoff
series lasts seven games. For those keeping
track, that's 34.1 percent of the length of the
regular season, tying with the NHL for the
longest postseason in

comparison to the reg
ular season of the four
major American sports
leagues. Even if we as-

sume that a champi
onship team only
needs six games to
win each series, that's

still a 24-game post
season, which is 29.3 percent of the length of
the regular season and still longer than the MLB
and NFL playoffs at their longest.
However, while the NHL playoffs provide
excitement in the form of upsets, the NBA
playoffs rarely see a much lower-seeded team
win. In the NHL, the No. 8 Los Angeles Kings
won the Stanley Cup just two years ago. While
there have been ten 8-seed over 1-seed upsets
in the NHL playoffs since 1994, there have on
ly been five first-round victories for 8-seeds
over 1-seeds in the NBA. Over the past five
years, 17 of the 40 first-round series in the
NHL have been won by the lower seed. In that
same span, only 11 of the 40 first-round series
in the NBA have been won by the lower seed.
Let's face it, is anyone who is not a Rap
tors or Wizards fan going to follow a potential
first round series between Toronto and Wash
ington this year? Should we really make the
Heat wait up to a week to begin their next se
ries after they sweep the Bobcats?
The NBA playoffs are too long. Earlier this
season, during an ESPN broadcast of a Heat-
Pacers game, the broadcasting team was dis
cussing how they couldn't wait for a Heat-Pac-

ers Eastern Conference Finals matchup. Why
should we have to wait as long as we do? Yes,
neither the Heat nor the Pacers has looked as
dominant lately, but it would still take an upset
of massive proportions for a team to take
down either of them in the first two rounds.
Even in the much more competitive Western
Conference, it's unlikely that the Grizzlies,
Mavericks or Trailblazers could earn a first
round series win in the current format.

Unlike baseball, where playoff games fre
quently occur on back-to-back days, the NBA
playoffs always allot at least one day off between
games and generally two days off for travel,
stretching the playoffs to nearly two months
long. We are forced to wait for meaningful,
competitive series for several extra weeks.

The NBA should expedite the earlier
rounds, which would also allow for more dra
ma with early-round upsets. The first two
rounds should be no longer than a best-of-five
series maybe even the conference finals
too â€”while the NBA Finals should retain the
best-of-seven format. Truly dominant teams
would still advance, but games would have
more at stake and provide more intriguing ac
tion, like the fast-paced style of March Mad
ness.

I truly enjoy watching the intense action
that comes from much of the NBA Playoffs.
Last year's NBA Finals and Eastern Confer
ence Finals were some of the best in recent
memory. Like a lot of fans, though, the playoff
thrill doesn't really begin for me until the later
rounds. Maybe I'm just impatient, but I want
to get to the good stuff now.

Michael Peterson is not enthralled by the
prospect of watching the Nets and Raptors
slog it out for the right to play the Heat in the
Eastern Conference Semifinals; that is, if the
two-time defending champs can outlast the
formidable Bobcats. Send all suggestions for
reading material to tide him over until the con
ference finals at mrpeters@stanford.edu and

Why should we
have to wait as long
as we do?
