# NBA Playoffs need a fast-forward button

This Saturday, the NBA Playoffs will
tip off with 16 teams vying for the
elusive goal of winning an NBA
Championship. But hold on, folks,
because we won't see a winner
crowned for another two months, with the
NBA Finals potentially ending in mid-June.
After an 82-game regular season, a champi
onship-winning team could have to play in 28
more games to win an NBA Finals if each playoff
series lasts seven games. For those keeping
track, that's 34.1 percent of the length of the
regular season, tying with the NHL for the
longest postseason in

comparison to the reg
ular season of the four
major American sports
leagues. Even if we as-

sume that a champi
onship team only
needs six games to
win each series, that's

still a 24-game post
season, which is 29.3 percent of the length of
the regular season and still longer than the MLB
and NFL playoffs at their longest.
However, while the NHL playoffs provide
excitement in the form of upsets, the NBA
playoffs rarely see a much lower-seeded team
win. In the NHL, the No. 8 Los Angeles Kings
won the Stanley Cup just two years ago. While
there have been ten 8-seed over 1-seed upsets
in the NHL playoffs since 1994, there have on
ly been five first-round victories for 8-seeds
over 1-seeds in the NBA. Over the past five
years, 17 of the 40 first-round series in the
NHL have been won by the lower seed. In that
same span, only 11 of the 40 first-round series
in the NBA have been won by the lower seed.
Let's face it, is anyone who is not a Rap
tors or Wizards fan going to follow a potential
first round series between Toronto and Wash
ington this year? Should we really make the
Heat wait up to a week to begin their next se
ries after they sweep the Bobcats?
The NBA playoffs are too long. Earlier this
season, during an ESPN broadcast of a Heat-
Pacers game, the broadcasting team was dis
cussing how they couldn't wait for a Heat-Pac-
