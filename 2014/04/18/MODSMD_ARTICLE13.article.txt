## Diving coach Schavone announces retirement 
### â€“ Cameron Miller 
Rick Schavone announced his retirement
from his position as Stanford's head diving
coach on Thursday. After manning the post
for 36 years in a coaching career that
stretched over five decades, Schavone, who
owns a doctorate in sports psychology, cited
age as the main factor in his decision.
"I knew the time was coming," Schavone
told GoStanford.com. "I'll be 65 years old in a
month, so I decided the time is now. I've been
very lucky to spend 36 years at a great univer
sity coaching some amazing student-athletes.
I want to thank all the Stanford divers for a
wonderful rewarding journey. I hope that I've
added something to their lives, for I can assure
you they have to mine."
Schavone leaves behind a rich coaching
legacy, having been named the NCAA's Diving
Coach of the Year on four separate occasions,
as well as receiving the same honor for the
Pac-12 nine times. The former diving head
coach at Princeton has also led seven Stanford
divers to individual national championships,

including two from 2012 Olympic bronze
medalist and current junior Kristian Ipsen. In
addition, Schavone has helped direct numer
ous national teams, most notably as a coach
for the U.S. team at the 2012 Olympics and
the 2013 FINA World Championships.

It is unclear whether Schavone will con
tinue to teach his popular Sports Psychology
class beyond this year, or who will replace him
as head of the diving program. What is evi
dent, however, is that his name will not soon
be forgotten in the lore of Stanford swimming
and diving.
"Rick has achieved so much greatness as a
coach for not only Stanford but at the national
and international level," Director of Men's
Swimming Ted Knapp told GoStanford.com on
Thursday. "His admiration extends throughout
the entire diving community. But not only do I
admire him for his coaching accomplishments
and the legacy he leaves here at Stanford, I
more importantly respect and honor him as a
person. You could not ask for a better person
to be a friend, colleague and mentor. He will
be missed in many, many ways."
