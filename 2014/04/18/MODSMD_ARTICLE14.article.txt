# VAGINA MONOLOGUES
## THE
						INTERNATIONAL PHENOMENON IS SET TO MAKE WAVES ON CAMPUS

Noemi Berkowitz 'l6, direc
tor of this year's annual
production of "The Vagina
Monologues," says she has
grown accustomed to the
word "vagina." "I've never
in my life said vagina so much in a
two-month period," Berkowitz
laughed. "It's a weird word. It's not
a sexy word...but we use it a lot."
Yet, as Berkowitz - who is a
Daily staffer - explains, the use of
the word "vagina" is hugely signifi
cant, as it is linked to talking freely
about female bodies, female sexual

experiences and notions of female
sexual empowerment. Openly dis
cussing these issues, however, is
not yet a comfortable or normal
ized phenomenon and continues
to be an issue today.
Enter "The Vagina Mono
logues," which opens its perennial
production on Stanford's campus
this weekend.

Originally produced in 1996
by playwright and activist Eve En
sler, "The Vagina Monologues"
started as an "episodic play" con
sisting of a compilation of mono
logues. Each monologue is typically
performed by a different actress

and can cover an array of topics
around the female experience, in
cluding sex, love, rape, menstrua
tion, female genital mutilation,
masturbation, childbirth, orgasms,
common names for the vagina and
more.

"In 1996, this was super revo
lutionary, because you don't get a
bunch of women standing up and
talking about their vaginas,"
Berkowitz said.

Eighteen years later, "The
Vagina Monologues" has grown to
encompass a giant corpus of work,
with new monologues added to it
each year. Each new production of
the show can select a particular set
of monologues from within the
larger collection to perform. As
Stanford has presented an annual
spring production of "The Vagina
Monologues" for many years, this
year's set of monologues will cer
tainly contain familiar pieces.
"You have some that are silly
and some that are really serious, so
you have a whole array of different
stories that are written to be kind
of universal," Berkowitz said.
However, while the mono
logues are meant to be universal,
Berkowitz encouraged her actress
es to personalize their monologues
for themselves during the rehearsal
process, in an effort to make them
believable.

"I urged all of the girls not to
go look at You Tube videos of what
other people had done, but to real
ly make each monologue her own,"
Berkowitz said. "I wanted each
woman to create a character and a
thorough backstory. I don't think
that these are the same characters
necessarily that you might see in
another production."
