# VAGINA MONOLOGUES
## THE 						INTERNATIONAL PHENOMENON IS SET TO MAKE WAVES ON CAMPUS 
### KATIE STRAUB 
Noemi Berkowitz 'l6, direc
tor of this year's annual
production of "The Vagina
Monologues," says she has
grown accustomed to the
word "vagina." "I've never
in my life said vagina so much in a
two-month period," Berkowitz
laughed. "It's a weird word. It's not
a sexy word...but we use it a lot."
Yet, as Berkowitz - who is a
Daily staffer - explains, the use of
the word "vagina" is hugely signifi
cant, as it is linked to talking freely
about female bodies, female sexual

experiences and notions of female
sexual empowerment. Openly dis
cussing these issues, however, is
not yet a comfortable or normal
ized phenomenon and continues
to be an issue today.
Enter "The Vagina Mono
logues," which opens its perennial
production on Stanford's campus
this weekend.

Originally produced in 1996
by playwright and activist Eve En
sler, "The Vagina Monologues"
started as an "episodic play" con
sisting of a compilation of mono
logues. Each monologue is typically
performed by a different actress

and can cover an array of topics
around the female experience, in
cluding sex, love, rape, menstrua
tion, female genital mutilation,
masturbation, childbirth, orgasms,
common names for the vagina and
more.

"In 1996, this was super revo
lutionary, because you don't get a
bunch of women standing up and
talking about their vaginas,"
Berkowitz said.

Eighteen years later, "The
Vagina Monologues" has grown to
encompass a giant corpus of work,
with new monologues added to it
each year. Each new production of
the show can select a particular set
of monologues from within the
larger collection to perform. As
Stanford has presented an annual
spring production of "The Vagina
Monologues" for many years, this
year's set of monologues will cer
tainly contain familiar pieces.
"You have some that are silly
and some that are really serious, so
you have a whole array of different
stories that are written to be kind
of universal," Berkowitz said.
However, while the mono
logues are meant to be universal,
Berkowitz encouraged her actress
es to personalize their monologues
for themselves during the rehearsal
process, in an effort to make them
believable.

"I urged all of the girls not to
go look at You Tube videos of what
other people had done, but to real
ly make each monologue her own,"
Berkowitz said. "I wanted each
woman to create a character and a
thorough backstory. I don't think
that these are the same characters
necessarily that you might see in
another production."
Jessica Smith 'l5, a theater
newcomer, became involved in the


SAM GIRVIN/The Stanford Daily
production through the encourage
ment of her teammates from
women's rugby. She explained that
her monologue is informed by her
own life and the experiences of her
friends.

"I have really been able to tap
into my personal experiences and
bring it into the character, because
otherwise you feel like you are just
reading the words on paper," Smith
said. "I was able to make it my own -
I was like, 'this character is whoever
I want it to be.'"

Bonnie Mclindon 'l4 has seen
Stanford's production of "The Vagina
Monologues" every year for the last
three years, and will act in this year's
iteration. She performs a well
known monologue entitled "The
Flood," spoken from the perspective
of an elderly woman.
"I hardcore channeled my
grandmother and decided to do it in
a southern accent," Mclindon ex
plained. "I expect my version of 'The
Flood' to be very different from the
version I saw freshman year and dif
ferent from the versions that take
place all over the country. And I
think that makes this a very power
ful project because it really becomes
customized for each community."
"The Vagina Monologues" is the
cornerstone of V-Day, a global non

profit movement that has raised
close to $lOO million for women's
anti-violence groups through pro
ceeds of "The Vagina Monologues"
productions.

Each annual Stanford produc
tion of "The Vagina Monologues" is
produced through V-Day in combina
tion with the Women's Community
Center (WCC), and 90 percent of
the show's proceeds go to a specific
anti-violence group each year. This
year's beneficiary is the TRACY
House (Transgender Resources and
Advocacy Center for Youth), a Bay
Area non-profit dedicated to meeting
the underserved needs of transgen
der youth.
For Berkowitz and many of the
actresses involved in this year's pro
duction, charity is just one way by
which the production gives back to
the community.
Christina Medina 'l5, who per
forms a monologue as Eve Ensler
herself in the production, explained
her own belief that the show gives a
voice to some oft-ignored or silenced
issues.

"It talks about a lot of issues that
aren't normally presented. It really
gives a voice to domestic violence,
abuse, the abuse women face in oth
er countries, reclaiming the word
cunt, talking about orgasms and

childbirth and more," Medina said.
"It talks about how women shouldn't
be ashamed."

Echoing that sentiment, McLin
don argued that "The Vagina Mono
logues" does important activist work
for feminism and feminist issues
here at Stanford, a cause she said is
"very near and dear to my heart."
"This show is activism in that,
yes, we have a beneficiary...but also
college is a time for women and men
who didn't necessarily have a sex
positive upbringing to get introduced
to that and realize what a sex-posi
tive place Stanford can really be,"
she said.
Berkowitz said that she wants
the same for her production and ex
tended the goal one step further, to
calling on audience members to be
critical of the 20-year-old work and
use it as a springboard to discuss the
most pressing issues we face today.
"I want people to think: what is
still relevant and what might not be?
What is it saying and what is it not
saying? What should it be saying?
And if there is something left out,
write something," she said. "Write a
piece, write a monologue, write a
play. Speak up about it."
