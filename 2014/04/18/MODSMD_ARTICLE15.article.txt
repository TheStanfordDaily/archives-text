## 'Higher Education takes the web by storm 
### NOEMI BERKOWITZ 
You throw together a bunch of
overachieving, over-analytical,
occasionally inebriated college
kids who have never really
been exposed to rejection,
and what you get is a recipe
for disaster. We pretend we're too
cool or too busy or too smart to care.
I think that's pretty stupid."
Sound like a fairly accurate de
scription of Stanford students? It's
actually a line from a new student
web series, "Higher Education," set
at the fictional California University
of Palo Alto, or CUPA. It manages to
poke fun at college life while also
imparting some pretty universal
truths about it. Last week, I sat
down with creators Cody Behan
'l5, Weston Gaylord 'l5, and Safiya
Nygaard 'l4 to talk more about the
process behind their witty, entertain
ing web series.
The idea came about last spring
quarter, according to the creators,
when Behan approached Gaylord
and Nygaard about creating a web
series. At first, they planned to cre
ate 20-minute episodes, complete
with fake commercials, with narra
tive threads throughout: on-campus
Senate elections, a "skeezy" RA and
a girl who doesn't even go here.
Over the summer, however,
the plan changed. Internships took
the creators to opposite ends of the
country, and three-way Skype ses
sions ensued as they shifted the
web series from a narrative format
to the episodic form it takes now.
They also cut the episodes down to
around five minutes each. Despite
that upheaval, however, the original

vision persisted.
"Though we've had so many
different iterations of this idea, the
people who we knew we were writ
ing for have always stayed the same,
and I think that's the reason it all
worked out," Nygaard explained.
"That's why we ended up having
something after all these changes."
When they came back to cam
pus, the creators already had collab
orators - actors, camera operators
and many others - on board, mostly
friends who they'd asked personally
to join.

"We filmed every weekend, of
ten for eight hours a day," Behan ex
plained. "And then towards the
last three weeks of school, it was
literally every day, trying to get
just one more scene. You have to
chip away at it, or it's just not going
to get done."
The creators faced complicat
ed logistical challenges, including
navigating filming rights, actor
schedules, last-minute location
changes and a fluctuating number
of extras. As time progressed, their
process became more streamlined,
but filming eight episodes proved
ambitious - they used every second
of free time they had, eventually

wrapping a few hours before Behan
and Gaylord left for their 4 a.m.
flight home.
The first four episodes were re
leased last quarter, and are full of
clever jokes that are particularly rele
vant to Stanford students.

"Even when we were spending
8 hours a day on it, exhausted, it was
still fun every time on set," Gaylord
told me.

The time invested clearly pays
off - each shot truly adds something,
whether a comedic beat or an im
portant piece of information, to the
overall episode. Behan, Gaylord,
and Nygaard evidently also spent
time honing the jokes and succeed
with perfectly delivered lines, in
cluding a personal favorite: "That's
why I live in a hermetically-sealed

bunker underneath campus. I'm
not going to say secret society, but
I don't not live in a secret society...
50... double negative."
Each of the actors is so perfect
ly in character as recognizable faces
from around campus, including the
co-op girl who brings jars to class,
the sleazy frat boy, and the girl with
a Tumblr of cats facing foreclosure.
Each episode focuses, with eerie ac
curacy, on one aspect of campus life,
through the lens of the student tour
guides at CUPA.
"Higher Education" is a shining
example of the direction I hope
arts and entertainment goes on
campus - it's a carefully crafted, in
novative, and accessible student
creation. Keep your eyes open for
shorts that may be released over the

summer, and a potential season two
next year. You won't want to miss
your classmates delivering great
one-liners like: "I mean, roses, real
ly? It's a gala, not an orgy."
Don't just take my word for it.
Catch up on the past episodes, and
get ready for the new ones being
released today. I have to warn you,
though you might just get
hooked.

thor has one line as an extra

sculptures from any angle. Brown
expressed confidence that this
technology could lead to further ad
vancements in the teaching of

anatomy.
Auguste Rodin studied anato
my as part of his training as an art
student. According to Bernard Bar
ryte, the Cantor Museum's curator
of the Rodin collection, it is known
for certain that the sculptor spent
time at the Musee Dupuytren in
Paris, which exhibits anatomical
items presenting pathologies.
Rodin started exhibiting sculptures
that depicted fragments of the hu
man body in the late 1880s; his ex
tensive modeling of hands
stemmed from Rodin's perception
of the hand as one of the most pow
erful means to convey emotion.
The exhibition falls very much

in line with Cantor's mission of
"engaging] Stanford students from
across disciplines, so as to broaden
their overall education and world
view," according to Connie Wolf
'Bl, director of the Cantor Arts
Center. With such a high density of
novel and interdisciplinary connec
tions to be grasped by the audi
ence, one can only wish the exhibi
tion benefited from a richer diagno
sis section and a larger space to ac
commodate the show.

"Inside Rodin's Hands: Art,
Technology and Surgery" is on
view until Aug. 3, 2014 in the
Halperin Gallery at the Cantor
Arts Center.
