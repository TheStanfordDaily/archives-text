## 'Higher Education takes the web by storm 
### NOEMI BERKOWITZ 
You throw together a bunch of
overachieving, over-analytical,
occasionally inebriated college
kids who have never really
been exposed to rejection,
and what you get is a recipe
for disaster. We pretend we're too
cool or too busy or too smart to care.
I think that's pretty stupid."
Sound like a fairly accurate de
scription of Stanford students? It's
actually a line from a new student
web series, "Higher Education," set
at the fictional California University
of Palo Alto, or CUPA. It manages to
poke fun at college life while also
imparting some pretty universal
truths about it. Last week, I sat
down with creators Cody Behan
'l5, Weston Gaylord 'l5, and Safiya
Nygaard 'l4 to talk more about the
process behind their witty, entertain
ing web series.
The idea came about last spring
quarter, according to the creators,
when Behan approached Gaylord
and Nygaard about creating a web
series. At first, they planned to cre
ate 20-minute episodes, complete
with fake commercials, with narra
tive threads throughout: on-campus
Senate elections, a "skeezy" RA and
a girl who doesn't even go here.
Over the summer, however,
the plan changed. Internships took
the creators to opposite ends of the
country, and three-way Skype ses
sions ensued as they shifted the
web series from a narrative format
to the episodic form it takes now.
They also cut the episodes down to
around five minutes each. Despite
that upheaval, however, the original

vision persisted.
"Though we've had so many
different iterations of this idea, the
people who we knew we were writ
ing for have always stayed the same,
and I think that's the reason it all
worked out," Nygaard explained.
"That's why we ended up having
something after all these changes."
When they came back to cam
pus, the creators already had collab
orators - actors, camera operators
and many others - on board, mostly
friends who they'd asked personally
to join.

"We filmed every weekend, of
ten for eight hours a day," Behan ex
plained. "And then towards the
last three weeks of school, it was
literally every day, trying to get
just one more scene. You have to
chip away at it, or it's just not going
to get done."
The creators faced complicat
ed logistical challenges, including
navigating filming rights, actor
schedules, last-minute location
changes and a fluctuating number
of extras. As time progressed, their
process became more streamlined,
but filming eight episodes proved
ambitious - they used every second
of free time they had, eventually
