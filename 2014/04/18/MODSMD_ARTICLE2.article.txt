## Professors discuss viability of tracking Tradeoff between environmental damage and energy independence 
### KATHERINE CARR 
On Tuesday at Tresidder Union, a panel
of five Stanford professors discussed hy
draulic fracturing, also known as fracking,
and its potential as an alternative energy
source. Hosted by Students for a Sustain
able Stanford and moderated by Pamela
Matson, dean of the School of Earth Sci
ences, the panel focused on current energy
sources and implications.

Fracking is the use of pressurized wa
ter and chemicals to create or widen frac
tures in the Earth's surface to reach oil or
natural gas deep underground. Given the

Earth's diminishing energy reserves, this
newly accessible source of fuel promises an
alternative to coal consumption. The panel
discussion emphasized, however, that with
a new energy source come advantages and
disadvantages for the environment.
The five professors, with backgrounds
ranging from geophysics and environmental
law to civil and environmental engineering,
shared their thoughts on alternative energy
sources, focusing on fracking and its impli
cations in California and the United States.
