## Professors discuss viability of tracking Tradeoff between environmental damage and energy independence 
### KATHERINE CARR 
On Tuesday at Tresidder Union, a panel
of five Stanford professors discussed hy
draulic fracturing, also known as fracking,
and its potential as an alternative energy
source. Hosted by Students for a Sustain
able Stanford and moderated by Pamela
Matson, dean of the School of Earth Sci
ences, the panel focused on current energy
sources and implications.

Fracking is the use of pressurized wa
ter and chemicals to create or widen frac
tures in the Earth's surface to reach oil or
natural gas deep underground. Given the

Earth's diminishing energy reserves, this
newly accessible source of fuel promises an
alternative to coal consumption. The panel
discussion emphasized, however, that with
a new energy source come advantages and
disadvantages for the environment.
The five professors, with backgrounds
ranging from geophysics and environmental
law to civil and environmental engineering,
shared their thoughts on alternative energy
sources, focusing on fracking and its impli
cations in California and the United States.

new technology because it will low
er carbon emissions and enable the
United States to be less dependent
on other forms of energy. Fracking
opponents generally cite the envi
ronmental issues, social ramifica
tions and methane emissions that
come with drawing natural gas
from deep in the earth.
"The question is to drill or not
to drill," said Michael Wara, associ
ate professor of law, who special
izes in energy and environmental
law.

Creating holes in the earth
causes problems of its own, accord
ing to the panelists, such as the po
tential to trigger more earthquakes
today and in the future.
Apart from the actual drilling,
there are other drawbacks of hack
ing. For example, the consumption
of natural gas releases methane
and other harmful chemicals into
the air.

Mark Jacobson 'B7 M.S. 'BB, a
professor of civil and environmen
tal engineering who uses computer
simulators to detect pollution and

climate changes, addressed the en
ergy debate of coal versus natural
gas.

"While coal produces more
carbon dioxide, natural gas releases
more ammonia, methane and car
bon monoxide," Jacobson said.
Following the panel discus
sion, the event was opened to audi
ence questions.

An audience member asked
about recent methane leakage
from tracking, to which Jackson re
sponded that the leakage occurred
from the pipes used to transport
the natural gas. While the current
method of transporting the gas
through old pipes can lead to expo
sure of harmful chemicals into the
air, Jackson noted that a number of
states plan to follow the example of
a cast iron pipe replacement pro
gram undertaken in Ohio.
"[We] need better ways to de
tect leaks and treat them," added
Sally Benson, professor of energy
resources engineering.

Preventing leaks and using sea
water instead of fresh water in the
fracking process could promise a
safer and more appealing future for
fracking, according to panelists.

Mark Zoback M.S. '73 Ph.D
'75, professor of geophysics, also
suggested "establishing a long term
goal (of reducing carbon emissions)
by creating a carbon tax."
This tax would promote alter
native sources of energy, which
could prove less hazardous to the
environment.
