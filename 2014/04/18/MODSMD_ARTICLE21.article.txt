## Why Weekend Two will be anything but second-rate 
### MINNA XIAO 
»ow that Weekend One has
drawn to a close, the
Coachella Valley Music and
Arts Festival, Indio's annu
al desert smorgasbord of
musical spectacle and
artistry, is gearing up for its second
three-day run.
This year's headliners include
rock giants Muse and Arcade Fire,
and perhaps the festival's singularly
most anticipated act rap duo
OutKast, whose Weekend One per
formance marked the first reunion

of Andre 3000 and Big Boi in nearly
a decade. Hip-hop legend Nas is
celebrating the 20th anniversary of
his seminal debut album "Illmatic"
by performing the record in its en
tirety, and his Weekend One set in
cluded a guest stint by Jay-Z.
The three-day lineup has its
fair share of Top-40 mainstays and
commercial darlings, from the pre
cocious New Zealand chanteuse
Lorde, to the sultry and polarizing
Lana Del Rey to the seemingly age
less Pharrell, who is riding the mo
mentum of a year-long streak of
übiquitous, chart-topping collabora

tions ("Get Lucky," "Blurred
Lines") and his freshly released al
bum "GIRL."

In keeping with the ever-grow
ing trend towards electronic music,
Coachella also boasts a perform
ance roster studded with EDM
heavy hitters like Skrillex, Calvin
Harris and Martin Garrix, who are
guaranteed to draw huge crowds of
thrumming bodies to their sets.
Here's a look at four of the most ex
citing acts coming to Weekend Two
of Coachella.
