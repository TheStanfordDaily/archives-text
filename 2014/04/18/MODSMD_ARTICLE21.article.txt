## Why Weekend Two will be anything but second-rate 
### MINNA XIAO 
»ow that Weekend One has
drawn to a close, the
Coachella Valley Music and
Arts Festival, Indio's annu
al desert smorgasbord of
musical spectacle and
artistry, is gearing up for its second
three-day run.
This year's headliners include
rock giants Muse and Arcade Fire,
and perhaps the festival's singularly
most anticipated act rap duo
OutKast, whose Weekend One per
formance marked the first reunion

of Andre 3000 and Big Boi in nearly
a decade. Hip-hop legend Nas is
celebrating the 20th anniversary of
his seminal debut album "Illmatic"
by performing the record in its en
tirety, and his Weekend One set in
cluded a guest stint by Jay-Z.
The three-day lineup has its
fair share of Top-40 mainstays and
commercial darlings, from the pre
cocious New Zealand chanteuse
Lorde, to the sultry and polarizing
Lana Del Rey to the seemingly age
less Pharrell, who is riding the mo
mentum of a year-long streak of
übiquitous, chart-topping collabora

tions ("Get Lucky," "Blurred
Lines") and his freshly released al
bum "GIRL."

In keeping with the ever-grow
ing trend towards electronic music,
Coachella also boasts a perform
ance roster studded with EDM
heavy hitters like Skrillex, Calvin
Harris and Martin Garrix, who are
guaranteed to draw huge crowds of
thrumming bodies to their sets.
Here's a look at four of the most ex
citing acts coming to Weekend Two
of Coachella.
Chance the Rapper
This Chicago native turns the ripe old age
of 21 this Wednesday, and is already being hailed
by some as rap's newest golden boy. After open
ing for Childish Gambino's North America
tour in 2012, Chance dropped his stellar and
critically-acclaimed second mixtape, "Acid
Rap," in 2013. A dynamic and energetic per
former, Chance works his playfully nasal vo
cals with remarkable dexterity as he free
wheels through funky, nostalgia-infused tracks
like "Cocoa Butter Kisses," and careens from
infectious irreverence to subdued sobriety
within the span of a single track on "Pusha
Man/Paranoia."
Haim
Hailing from Los Angeles, the three sis
ters that comprise Haim have made the art of
pop rock something of a family business. Pol
ished and effervescent, Haim's full-length de
but album Days Are Gone is unapologetical
ly catchy and abounds with breathy vocals,
indelible hooks and thumping drum beats
displayed on such gems as "The Wire,"
"Falling" and "Forever."
MS MR
Lyricist Lizzy Plapinger's raw, sultry vo

cals, laid over Max Hershenow's haunting
and symphonic production of synthesizers
and drums, create an intoxicating, ethereal
ambience that defines some of the best
tracks on MS MR's debut album "Second
hand Serenade," such as "Hurricane," "BT
SK" and "Fantasy." The duo has also released
a gleaming remix of Mo's "Pilgrim," while
CHVRCHES, another highly anticipated
Coachella act, successfully adds its own bub
blegum-electronic twist to MS MR's "Hurri
canes" in a separate noteworthy remix effort.
Disclosure
The brothers behind Disclosure,
Howard and Guy Lawrence, proved that they
are a force to be reckoned with following the
release of their 2013 dance record debut,
"Settle." The high-energy sound of "Settle" is
a diverse but tight assemblage of pulsing pop
beats, beguiling female vocalists and shim
mery synths. The record also benefits from
an impressive string of well-calculated,
choice collaborations Sam Smith
("Latch"), AlunaGeorge ("White Noise") and
London Grammar ("Help Me Lose My
Mind").
