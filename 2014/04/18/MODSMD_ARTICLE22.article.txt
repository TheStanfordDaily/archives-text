## Cantor exhibits Rodin sculptures 
### SILVIANA ILCUS 
Inside Rodin's Hands: Art, Tech
nology and Surgery," a tempo
rary exhibition at the Cantor
Arts Center that opened last
week, features Rodin hand
sculptures which have been
diagnosed for pathologies and vir
tually operated on. Anatomy texts
published between the 16th and
19th centuries that illustrate the
historical development of the
study of anatomy are also on dis
play, as are augmented reality in
stallations that allow the public to
view the anatomical structures
that would lie inside some of the
exhibited sculptures.
The exhibition emerged from
collaboration between the Cantor
Arts Center, Professor of Surgery
James Chang 'B7 and his stu
dents, the Division of Clinical
Anatomy and the Lane Medical
Library. It was inspired by what
started for Chang, a professor and
chief of plastic and reconstructive
surgery, as a hobby 15 years ago.
As a surgery resident at the
Stanford Hospital, Chang began
noticing that most of Rodin's hand
sculptures appeared to portray
conditions he was treating. For
example, "Large Left Hand"
seemed likely to have had frac
tured metacarpals the bones
connecting the wrist to the fin
gersâ€” while "Large Clenched
Left Hand" appeared to depict a
hand affected by Charcot-Marie-
Tooth disease, an inherited neuro
logical disease. The former has
even been virtually operated on
by Chang and his students; visi
tors can observe the result of the
virtual surgery through the aid of
the technology developed by As

sociate Professor of Anatomy Paul
Brown, exhibit production man
ager Matt Hasel and medical artist
Sarah Hegmann.
Chang's game of diagnosing
the sculptures became a teaching
tool that he has employed both
with surgical trainees and with
the undergraduates taking his in
troductory seminar, SURG 70Q:
Surgical Anatomy of the Hand:
From Rodin to Reconstruction.
The supposed diagnoses made by
Chang and his students accompa
ny the exhibits.
The origins of using art as a
teaching tool in the School of
Medicine can be traced back to
Professor Emeritus of Surgery
Robert Chase, the founder of the
Robert A. Chase Hand & Upper
Limb Center. Not only was Chase
the first to start giving regular
tours and lectures on art and
anatomy, which are still regularly
offered today, but according to
Brown, he was also a proponent
of making a three-dimensional vir
tual representation of Rodin's
sculptures.

Chase's idea led to a summer
project involving Stanford scien
tists and high school students
from the Bay Area, which resulted
in the augmented reality feature
of the exhibition. The hand sculp
tures were three-dimensionally
scanned using a zebra-like pattern
of light, and using previously ex
isting data, Hegmann mapped the
scanned sculpture to the anatomy
of patients presenting the
pathologies the sculptures had
been diagnosed with. Using iPads
mounted next to the sculptures,
visitors can "look inside" the
