## JAKE SHIMABUKURO PLAYS UKULELE A! BING CONCERT HALL 
### SOPHIA DAO 
With four simple strings and his
one-of-a-kind Kamaka tenor
ukulele, Jake Shimabukuro will
infuse Hawaiian soul into Bing
Concert Hall on Thursday, April
24. Sample a slice of
Shimabukuro's vast ability with these five
videos that showcase the versatility of the
ukulele in the hands of a masterful musician.
"While My Guitar Gently Weeps"
A recording of this famous song by
George Harrison propelled Shimabukuro to
Internet fame more than eight years ago. The
stimulating rhythms, vibrant strumming and
fingerpicking technique, combined with
Shimabukuro's full-bodied energy, struck a
chord with viewers across the globe.
"Bohemian Rhapsody"
In his rendition of Queen's "Bohemian
Rhapsody," the ukulele virtuoso allows the

sweet lyricism of his instrument to carry
Queen's legendary fantasy message. Through
the ukulele, the rock operetta takes on a re
freshing tropical feel, and Shimabukuro once
again inspires through his honest and open
tone.
"Sakura, Sakura"
Long ago in Japan, students studied the
13-stringed koto and played a piece called
"Sakura Sakura" to welcome the spring sea
son and its cherry blossoms. Shimabukuro
shows us the universal appeal of the ukulele
by imitating the piercing sound of the koto
with electrifying string plucking on his own
arrangement of the traditional folk song.
"143 (Kelly's Song)"
During the seemingly distant time of
cassettes and beepers, paging a dear one
"143" stood for a shorthanded "I love you."
Shimabukuro displays his pager-sawy lingo in
this original creation dedicated to then-fi
ancee Kelly, who Shimabukuro married in
May 2011. Listen to the sheer joy and won
der Shimabukuro imparts through warm har
monies and a brisk tempo fit for loving notes.

"Blue Roses Falling"
Through a dreamlike composition dedi
cated to his friend's ailing grandmother,
Shimabukuro gives us the essence of the
ukulele as a provider of peace and love in the
midst of uncertainty. Imagine as you listen a
ceiling abound with blue roses, their petals
gently falling and perhaps grazing the tip of
your nose. Shimabukuro shelters this deli
cate image with the voice of his physically
small yet expressively immense instrument.

Wherever Shimabukuro goes, his mes
sage of harmony resonates with audiences
through the charm and dynamism of the
ukulele. A humble instrument with unlimit
ed capacity, the amiable ukulele makes a re
markable reality from modest aspirations.
Whether through the hands of Shimabukuro
or through your own hands, consider kin
dling the ageless song and spirit of the
ukulele to inspire peace within yourself and
perhaps within your neighbor as well.
