## Students vote to divest Fossil Free Stanford moves discussion closer to Trustees 
### LUCY SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
In this year's ASSU elections,
voters approved a ballot initiative
to divest Stanford's endowment
from fossil fuels with 78 percent of
votes in favor, setting in motion a
process that could eventually lead
to the Board of Trustees.

In the run-up to the vote, Fos
sil Free Stanford the student
group that championed the ballot
initiative for divestment led a
large campaign called Divestment
Week.

Divestment Week featured a
number of rallies, culminating in
the largest one on April 11, the fi
nal day of the election. Nearly 60
students and alumni marched from
White Plaza to University President
John Hennessy's office and deliv
ered over 200 handwritten letters
from alumni in support of divest
ment. Professor of Biology Paul
Ehrlich spoke at the rally along
with several student supporters
and alumni.

Leading up to the vote, most
of Fossil Free Stanford's efforts
were concentrated on outreach.

"During the lead up to the
election our primary goal was to
talk to every single Stanford stu
dent we could get our hands on,"
said Michael Penuelas 'l5, a stu
dent organizer of the Fossil Free
movement. "Over the week we
talked to hundreds and hundreds
of different students, bringing the
total in this movement so far up to
thousands of Stanford undergradu
ates in particular."

While the divestment initiative
had overwhelming student sup
port, the divestment petition must
still make its way through several
advisory committees before the
Board of Trustees will vote on it.
Fossil Free Stanford has had mini
mal contact with the board mem
bers thus far, and according to Yari
Greaney 'l5, a student organizer of
the Fossil Free movement, the or
ganization is "waiting until we have
formally reached their plate before
we start dialogue with them."

Fossil Free Stanford has
worked, however, with the Adviso
ry Panel on Investment Responsi
bility and Licensing (APIRL) for
over a year. APIRL has researched
the request to divest Stanford
from fossil fuels and, according to
Greaney, is on target to make a rec
ommendation to the Board of
Trustees by the end of this aca
demic year.

"This is really, really powerful
for our movement and we are real
ly excited to see what the adminis
tration will do in response to the
overwhelming student support for
the ballot initiative," Greaney said.
"It is our hope that the board will
commit to divesting from the fossil
fuel industry come fall."

In his annual address to the
Academic Council on Thursday,
Hennessy addressed fossil fuel di
vestment during the question-and
answer period. He noted that the
divestment petition must make its
way through several advisory com
mittees before the Board of
Trustees will vote on it and that a

decision will likely be made at the
Trustees' June meeting or their
meeting next fall.
"We have a set of policies
around endowment and how we
think about investment responsi
bility and I think those policies
chart a set of goals with respect to
balancing the core goal of the en
dowment which is to draw rev
enue to run the University
against issues of social responsibil
ity that the University has," Hen
nessy said. "There are the core val
ues that we try to respect and or
ganize and how those will align
with long-term sustainability goals
is something I think we all have to
watch and be aware of."

Penuelas said that he hopes
that the recommendation from the
APIRL will help push the Board to
wards supporting divestment.
"While revenue generation is
the primary goal of the endow
ment, there is this formal mecha
nism that Stanford administration

respects enormously which is put
in place directly to make sure that
those investment decisions are still
congruent with Stanford's found
ing principles and values," Penue
las said. "But those definitely need
to go hand in hand and be consid
ered together, because where that
money goes is just as important."
Moving forward, Fossil Free
Stanford plans to continue its
alumni letter-writing campaign and
is also in the process of initiating a
Graduate Student Council resolu
tion that would express support
for divestment. The Undergradu
ate Senate passed a similar meas
ure last year. Additionally, Penuelas
noted that a letter that is currently
being circulated has garnered the
signatures of over 50 senior faculty
members.

"The idea is to engage all de
mographics of Stanford to prove
widespread support, which the un
dergraduate students proved re
soundingly this week," Penuelas
said. "We are hoping that more of
those other demographics manage
to do the same by the end of this
spring."

"It's important to remember
that divestment is a strategy and a
safe global climate is the goal. This
is just one strategy in a mix of
many strategies," Greaney said.
