# Hennessy: Sustainable Stanford
## President Hennessy addresses Academic Council 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
President John Hennessy focused on sustainability
in his annual address to the Academic Council, which
he delivered Thursday afternoon in CEMEX Auditori
um.

"Good sustainability practice begins with not wast
ing, whether it's not wasting food, not wasting energy,
not wasting water, and it's the action of all of us as in
dividuals that really contributes to that," Hennessy
said. "I think we want to be a model for the communi
ty we want to show that we can operate this univer

sity well."
Hennessy covered topics related to connections
across academic disciplines, faculty accomplishments,
admissions results and construction on campus before
turning to the main emphasis of his presentation: Stan
ford's previous and ongoing initiatives to improve sus
tainability on campus.
He was joined onstage by Pamela Matson, dean of
the School of Earth Sciences; Shirley Everett, senior as
sociate vice provost of Residential & Dining Enterprises
(R&DE); Joseph Stagner, executive director of

and energy management; and Fah
mida Ahmed, associate director of
sustainability and energy manage
ment.

The panel discussed major ini
tiatives such as the Y2E2 building,
the University's long-term water
and energy plans, and the "Love
Food, Hate Waste" campaign that is
part of R&DE's sustainability work.
According to Hennessy, the
construction of the Y2E2 building
which opened in 2008 and has
the highest possible LEED certifica
tionâ€” marked a watershed mo
ment for Stanford's commitment to
sustainability.

He noted that the new efficien
cy standards for Y2E2 set a prece
dent for other buildings on campus

particularly the new business
school campus and emphasized
that even though the buildings are
efficient, they are also attractive
and function well.

"This sends a message to the
whole community that you can be
sustainable and still have great-look
ing buildings that are terrific to
work in," Hennessy said. "I think
that's an important message to send
not only to campus but also send to
the broader community."
Stagner reported on the
progress of the Stanford Energy Sys
tem Innovations (SESI) project,
which is projected to be one of the
most energy-efficient university sys
tems in the world once fully imple
mented in April 2015.
"When this plan is complete,
we'll be moving off fossil fuel
natural gas, as it were directly
on campus, and we'll have an al
most all electric campus fueling our

energy with heat recovery," Stagner
explained.
Stagner also discussed an ef
fort to make water usage on cam
pus more sustainable by accessing
groundwater that flows approxi
mately 100 feet below campus.

"It's a sustainable resource that
is available and being underutilized
right now," Stagner said. "We con
ducted engineering studies... and
determined that we could probably
sustainably take water from the
Stanford lands without depleting
the reservoirs, and that amount of
water could be more than 50 per
cent of our current use."

However, Stagner noted that
shifting to groundwater from the
pristine mountain water could
change the chemistry of the water
and potentially affect lab work. He
said that over the next few months,
the water department will analyze
the effect on researchers and deter

mine how to mitigate these con
cerns.
On a more individualized level,
Everett described R&DE as working
to ensure that its operations
which serve over 6 million meals
annually are also sustainable.
"When we think of sustainabil
ity, we want to make sure that we
are sourcing locally, organically, hu
mane, fair-trade, family-owned and
from sustainable fisheries," Everett
said. "We want to make sure that
we offer food from any of those
venders that we work with that re
spect their land and their workers."
Everett also discussed the
ways in which R&DE tries to in
duce patrons to eat less food, such
as by eliminating trays, reducing
plate size and even forcing stu
dents to scrape their own trays in
order to make them aware of their
waste.
Other plans to improve cam

pus sustainability include a cam
pus-wide electric car charging net
work and collaboration across aca
demic departments to promote
food security, as well as the estab
lishment of on-campus gardens.
"[Sustainability] is the goal of
meeting the needs of people
our needs for food and energy and
water and shelter and education
and employment and everything
else while at the same time pro
tecting and sustaining the life sup
port systems of the planet," Mat
son said. "The focus here is inter
generational meeting our needs
as well as those of our children and
grandchildren. And really what bet
ter place to focus on that than at a
university like ours? Because it's
our business to be teaching and car
rying out research."
