## Why Hookup Culture Isn't Kinky Enough 
### Lily Zheng 
You know hookup culture ex
ists on this campus. Whether
or not you take part in it or
view it kindly, Stanford students in
particular seem to understand well
the formula of party drunk
flirting sex walk of shame (or
empowerment you own that
sex!).

It's a part of our campus cul
ture that seems to be just another
thing people get used to after a few
months here it could use a little
fixing, though.
When I say that hookup cul
ture isn't kinky enough, I don't
mean to say that the sex isn't kinky
enough. I've had my fair share of
sex with kinky people, but it's the
people that make the interactions
so different from a normal hookup.
Kinky people are communicative
people. At first glance, that seems
obvious you can't negotiate to
have yourself tied upside-down
from the rafters or put a ball gag in
your mouth without being commu

nicative, without talking about it
beforehand but the communica
tion applies to everything.

When I sit down at the San
Francisco Citadel and somebody si
dles up to me, a very different con
versation happens than what most
people would expect. No pickup
lines, no aggressive flirting, no
abrupt demands it's just
chitchat, until they ask me if I want
to play. I say no, they laugh and we
keep talking; I say yes, and we get
to negotiating.

"What do you want to do?" I
ask, and they tell me the things
they're interested in doing.
"How about you?" they ask,
and I respond with what I had in
mind which of course varies de
pending on my mood and how I'm
feeling that night.

"So it seems like we both want
to do this, sounds good!" Negotia
tion step one: check.
"Hard limits?" they ask, and I
think a bit before I tell them what

I'm not interested in doing. I can
tell them anything I want, from "no
sex" to "only sex" to "don't kiss
me" to "only use a particular toy."
And they'll grin and nod, grab their
bag of toys and tools they brought,
and head out to the play floor with
me. The standard safe words are
"yellow" for "keep going, but slow
down," and "red," for "stop now."
The whole conversation lasts maybe
10 minutes, maybe 15, tops.
And we have an amazing time
together.

That entire interaction seems
so foreign to people that it taking
place within a non-play party con
text seems impossible. "You can't

walk up to a party with the music
blaring and negotiate like that!"
Exactly because party mu
sic is made that loud on purpose.
There's no "rule of partying" that
states how loud the music should
be, but if you can't hear yourself
talking, you don't have to ask for
what you want. If you can't hear
yourself talking, the only way to
show what you want is to do it.
You don't ask someone if they
want to grind, you just do it and
hope that they're feeling it. If you
want to kiss someone, you play
the wordless game where you

"send them signals" and hope that
they make eye contact and hope
that they also want to kiss right
then and there and hope that
they're already too drunk to say no
when you want to do more. Are
we peacocks? Tipsy peacocks?
"Consent is sexy," right? But
if consent only means "a no is a
no," you can get all the way to the
bed, clothing off, without a word
spoken. The condom comes out,
the pants come off "no," they
say, and then things get awkward.
It's the equivalent of being already
tied up before realizing that you
had never agreed to it in the first
place.
"Sober, enthusiastic consent"
sounds a lot better but the very
nature of hookup culture discour
ages models like that one. When
we promote silence from the party
to the bedroom, and make that
"no" into something shameful, we
get that fuzzy line no one likes talk
ing about, that fuzzy line with the
words "consent violation" and
"rape" tattooed on it.
Those are the horror stories, at
least; sometimes hookups turn out
well. Sometimes the sex is good,
everyone wakes up happy, and we
all go about our lives. But that's not

a guarantee, and people know that.
There's riskiness involved every
step of the way avoiding roofies
at the parties, avoiding people who
come on to you too strongly on the
dance floor, avoiding rape in the
bedroom, trying to remember to
say "no."
Hookup culture is a guessing
game, flipping a coin with the sides
marked "rape" or "okay," and hop
ing it lands well. Some people
would say that the riskiness is part
of what makes it fun, what makes it
magical but gambling with con
sent isn't worth that.
"Negotiation is so awkward,
though!"
And you'd have a point cer
tainly, it breaks some norms to,
heaven forbid, talk about what you
want to do when you get intimate
with someone! Still, do it anyways.
You'd be surprised by how much
better intimacy gets when you talk
about it!
Hookup culture could be so
much safer, more intense, better...
with a little bit more communica
tion. Might be kinkier, too!

"send them signals" and hope that
they make eye contact and hope
that they also want to kiss right
then and there and hope that
they're already too drunk to say no
when you want to do more. Are
we peacocks? Tipsy peacocks?
"Consent is sexy," right? But
if consent only means "a no is a
no," you can get all the way to the
bed, clothing off, without a word
spoken. The condom comes out,
the pants come off "no," they
say, and then things get awkward.
It's the equivalent of being already
tied up before realizing that you
had never agreed to it in the first
place.
"Sober, enthusiastic consent"
sounds a lot better but the very
nature of hookup culture discour
ages models like that one. When
we promote silence from the party
to the bedroom, and make that
"no" into something shameful, we
get that fuzzy line no one likes talk
ing about, that fuzzy line with the
words "consent violation" and
"rape" tattooed on it.
Those are the horror stories, at
least; sometimes hookups turn out
well. Sometimes the sex is good,
everyone wakes up happy, and we
all go about our lives. But that's not

a guarantee, and people know that.
There's riskiness involved every
step of the way avoiding roofies
at the parties, avoiding people who
come on to you too strongly on the
dance floor, avoiding rape in the
bedroom, trying to remember to
say "no."
Hookup culture is a guessing
game, flipping a coin with the sides
marked "rape" or "okay," and hop
ing it lands well. Some people
would say that the riskiness is part
of what makes it fun, what makes it
magical but gambling with con
sent isn't worth that.
"Negotiation is so awkward,
though!"
And you'd have a point cer
tainly, it breaks some norms to,
heaven forbid, talk about what you
want to do when you get intimate
with someone! Still, do it anyways.
You'd be surprised by how much
better intimacy gets when you talk
about it!
Hookup culture could be so
much safer, more intense, better...
with a little bit more communica
tion. Might be kinkier, too!

You know hookup culture ex
ists on this campus. Whether
or not you take part in it or
view it kindly, Stanford students in
particular seem to understand well
the formula of party drunk
flirting sex walk of shame (or
empowerment you own that
sex!).

It's a part of our campus cul
ture that seems to be just another
thing people get used to after a few
months here it could use a little
fixing, though.
When I say that hookup cul
ture isn't kinky enough, I don't
mean to say that the sex isn't kinky
enough. I've had my fair share of
sex with kinky people, but it's the
people that make the interactions
so different from a normal hookup.
Kinky people are communicative
people. At first glance, that seems
obvious you can't negotiate to
have yourself tied upside-down
from the rafters or put a ball gag in
your mouth without being commu

nicative, without talking about it
beforehand but the communica
tion applies to everything.

When I sit down at the San
Francisco Citadel and somebody si
dles up to me, a very different con
versation happens than what most
people would expect. No pickup
lines, no aggressive flirting, no
abrupt demands it's just
chitchat, until they ask me if I want
to play. I say no, they laugh and we
keep talking; I say yes, and we get
to negotiating.

"What do you want to do?" I
ask, and they tell me the things
they're interested in doing.
"How about you?" they ask,
and I respond with what I had in
mind which of course varies de
pending on my mood and how I'm
feeling that night.

"So it seems like we both want
to do this, sounds good!" Negotia
tion step one: check.
"Hard limits?" they ask, and I
think a bit before I tell them what

I'm not interested in doing. I can
tell them anything I want, from "no
sex" to "only sex" to "don't kiss
me" to "only use a particular toy."
And they'll grin and nod, grab their
bag of toys and tools they brought,
and head out to the play floor with
me. The standard safe words are
"yellow" for "keep going, but slow
down," and "red," for "stop now."
The whole conversation lasts maybe
10 minutes, maybe 15, tops.
And we have an amazing time
together.

That entire interaction seems
so foreign to people that it taking
place within a non-play party con
text seems impossible. "You can't

walk up to a party with the music
blaring and negotiate like that!"
Exactly because party mu
sic is made that loud on purpose.
There's no "rule of partying" that
states how loud the music should
be, but if you can't hear yourself
talking, you don't have to ask for
what you want. If you can't hear
yourself talking, the only way to
show what you want is to do it.
You don't ask someone if they
want to grind, you just do it and
hope that they're feeling it. If you
want to kiss someone, you play
the wordless game where you

"send them signals" and hope that
they make eye contact and hope
that they also want to kiss right
then and there and hope that
