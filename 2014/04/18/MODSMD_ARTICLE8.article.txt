## M. VOLLEYBALL UC-Irvine marches on Maples 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 3 Stanford men's volleyball
team will head into Saturday with all of the
momentum in the world on its side, as it has
dominated as of late en route to its current
11-match winning streak. Next, the Cardinal
(20-7, 17-7 MPSF) will look to carry that mo
mentum through into the postseason as they
will host No. 6 UC-Irvine (18-10, 15-9) in an
MPSF Tournament quarterfinal match this
Saturday at Maples Pavilion. Stanford is seed
ed third in the eight-team tournament and
therefore has the home-court advantage over
the sixth-seeded Anteaters.

Despite having won both regular season
matches against UC-Irvine, including a
sweep at Maples back in February, Stanford
should expect and is indeed prepared for a
tough match. Last week's tilt between the
two teams hosted by Irvine was a very close
five-set thriller demonstrating how strong
and evenly matched both teams can be.
While the Card have home-court advantage
on their side and Maples normally pro
vides an edge for the Cardinal the
Anteaters are nonetheless an exceptionally
talented team. Furthermore, the stakes are
as high as they've been all season, as both
squads are playing for a spot in the semifinals
of the MPSF Tournament. The two teams
have met three times in the history of the
MPSF Tournament, with UCI having won
two matches and Stanford having claimed
the third.
Stanford currently holds the longest winning streak
in the country and has established itself as one of the
top teams in both the MPSF and NCAA. After struggling
on the road earlier this season, the Cardinal found their
rhythm and unity as a team. Their offense is one of the
most consistent and aggressive in the conference, lead
ing the league in both hitting percentage, with a .334 av
erage, and aces, with 1.44 per match. Stanford's seniors
have been critical to the team's success, especially out
side hitters Brian Cook and Steven Irvin. Both players av
erage well over 3 kills per set, with Cook averaging an
impressive 3.68 per set; they also boast an attack per
centage north of .300, with Cook at .346 and Irvin at
.313. Sophomore Conrad Kaminski has the highest at
tack percentage in the MPSF and is the only player to av
erage above a .500 percentage. Classmate and setter
James Shaw is also a valued asset to the team, with his
10.78 assists per set helping to keep the offense strong,
steady and dominant.

John Kosty's defense is another critical component
to the team's success. The team has limited opponents,
on average, to a hitting percentage of less than .250. As
a unit, Stanford averages 9.75 digs per set, with libero
Grant Delgado leading the way at 2.44 digs per set. Irvin
averages 1.85 digs per set outstanding for an outside
hitter contributing in a major way on both defense
and offense. The Cardinal are also a strong blocking team
and multiple times this season have been outhit by an op
ponent yet have still won because of superior blocking.
Stanford has totaled 233.5 blocks this season while op
ponents count only 197.5 in the same category.
Despite losing to Stanford last week, the Anteaters
still ended their regular season in dominating fashion.
UCI has won 11 of its last 14 matches and has worked
its way into a three-way tie for fifth-place in the MPSF,
alongside UCLA and Long Beach State. UCI also has ex
perience with success in the MPSF Tournament, having
won the conference championship two years ago. In that
tournament, they were the No. 4 seed and defeated
Stanford in a five-set match to win the title. The
Anteaters also beat Stanford to win the 2003 MPSF
Championship title. The squad averages over .300 in hit
ting percentage this season (.308) and rarely has an off
night on offense. Senior Scott Kevorken leads the unit
with a .445 attack percentage, the third highest in the
MPSF.

The other MPSF quarterfinal matches will also take
place this Saturday, with No. 1 BYU hosting No. 8 USC,
No. 2 Pepperdine playing No. 7 Long Beach State and
No. 4 UC-Santa Barbara taking on No. 5 UCLA. Tickets
to the Stanford match are currently on sale, with the
first 250 students receiving free admission to the 7 p.m.
match.

and multiple times this season have been outhit by an op
ponent yet have still won because of superior blocking.

its way into a three-way tie for fifth-place in the MPSF,
alongside UCLA and Long Beach State. UCI also has ex
perience with success in the MPSF Tournament, having

tournament, they were the No. 4 seed and defeated
Stanford in a five-set match to win the title. The
Anteaters also beat Stanford to win the 2003 MPSF
Championship title. The squad averages over .300 in hit
ting percentage this season (.308) and rarely has an off

The No. 3 Stanford men's volleyball
team will head into Saturday with all of the
momentum in the world on its side, as it has
dominated as of late en route to its current
11-match winning streak. Next, the Cardinal
(20-7, 17-7 MPSF) will look to carry that mo
mentum through into the postseason as they
will host No. 6 UC-Irvine (18-10, 15-9) in an
MPSF Tournament quarterfinal match this
Saturday at Maples Pavilion. Stanford is seed
ed third in the eight-team tournament and
therefore has the home-court advantage over
the sixth-seeded Anteaters.

Despite having won both regular season
matches against UC-Irvine, including a
sweep at Maples back in February, Stanford
should expect and is indeed prepared for a
tough match. Last week's tilt between the
two teams hosted by Irvine was a very close
five-set thriller demonstrating how strong
and evenly matched both teams can be.
While the Card have home-court advantage
on their side and Maples normally pro
vides an edge for the Cardinal the
Anteaters are nonetheless an exceptionally
talented team. Furthermore, the stakes are
as high as they've been all season, as both
squads are playing for a spot in the semifinals
of the MPSF Tournament. The two teams
have met three times in the history of the
MPSF Tournament, with UCI having won
two matches and Stanford having claimed
the third.
Stanford currently holds the longest winning streak
in the country and has established itself as one of the
top teams in both the MPSF and NCAA. After struggling
on the road earlier this season, the Cardinal found their
rhythm and unity as a team. Their offense is one of the
most consistent and aggressive in the conference, lead
ing the league in both hitting percentage, with a .334 av
erage, and aces, with 1.44 per match. Stanford's seniors
have been critical to the team's success, especially out
side hitters Brian Cook and Steven Irvin. Both players av
erage well over 3 kills per set, with Cook averaging an
impressive 3.68 per set; they also boast an attack per
centage north of .300, with Cook at .346 and Irvin at
.313. Sophomore Conrad Kaminski has the highest at
tack percentage in the MPSF and is the only player to av
erage above a .500 percentage. Classmate and setter
James Shaw is also a valued asset to the team, with his
10.78 assists per set helping to keep the offense strong,
steady and dominant.

John Kosty's defense is another critical component
to the team's success. The team has limited opponents,
on average, to a hitting percentage of less than .250. As
a unit, Stanford averages 9.75 digs per set, with libero
Grant Delgado leading the way at 2.44 digs per set. Irvin
averages 1.85 digs per set outstanding for an outside
hitter contributing in a major way on both defense
and offense. The Cardinal are also a strong blocking team
and multiple times this season have been outhit by an op
ponent yet have still won because of superior blocking.
