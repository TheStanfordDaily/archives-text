## M. VOLLEYBALL UC-Irvine marches on Maples 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 3 Stanford men's volleyball
team will head into Saturday with all of the
momentum in the world on its side, as it has
dominated as of late en route to its current
11-match winning streak. Next, the Cardinal
(20-7, 17-7 MPSF) will look to carry that mo
mentum through into the postseason as they
will host No. 6 UC-Irvine (18-10, 15-9) in an
MPSF Tournament quarterfinal match this
Saturday at Maples Pavilion. Stanford is seed
ed third in the eight-team tournament and
therefore has the home-court advantage over
the sixth-seeded Anteaters.

Despite having won both regular season
matches against UC-Irvine, including a
sweep at Maples back in February, Stanford
should expect and is indeed prepared for a
tough match. Last week's tilt between the
two teams hosted by Irvine was a very close
five-set thriller demonstrating how strong
and evenly matched both teams can be.
While the Card have home-court advantage
on their side and Maples normally pro
vides an edge for the Cardinal the
Anteaters are nonetheless an exceptionally
talented team. Furthermore, the stakes are
as high as they've been all season, as both
squads are playing for a spot in the semifinals
of the MPSF Tournament. The two teams
have met three times in the history of the
MPSF Tournament, with UCI having won
two matches and Stanford having claimed
the third.
