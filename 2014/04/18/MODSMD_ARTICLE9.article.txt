## PITCHING COACH HAS PROVEN HE CAN DEVELOP TALENT 
### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
He developed two pitchers to No. 1
selections in the MLB Draft over the last
five years and has had 65 of his pitchers
drafted over his last 20 seasons of coach
ing. He has mentored a pitching staff this
season that has more than held its own

and has been dominant at times, despite
having 60.8 percent of innings pitched by
the freshman pitchers through Tuesday.
Stanford pitching coach Rusty Filter is
no stranger to talent. But when you watch
his former players excel as upperclassmen
and in the big leagues, it's easy to overlook
the key role that he played in their ascent.
Filter is in his fifth season on the

Farm after spending 21 combined years at
San Diego State as a student-athlete and
assistant coach. His San Diego State pitch
ing staffs led the Mountain West Confer
ence in ERA in six of the league's first 10
seasons, and he has since built Stanford's
staff from both the recruiting and coach
ing standpoints. Still, his accolades that
stand out the most are the two No. 1 over
all draft picks.

Both SDSU pitcher Stephen Stras
burg and Mark Appel 'l3 faced challenges
and were doubted early on in their colle
giate careers. Strasburg faced an uphill
battle getting into strong physical shape
during his freshman season and Appel had
to overcome a taxing first year and develop
new pitches in order to do so.
For Filter, the mental side of the game
building up the confidence and mental
toughness of his student-athletes was a
large part of coaching strategy for those
two players and continues to be important
with his young staff this season.
"Coach Filter is interesting. He works
more on the mental side of the game than
any other coach I've worked with. He real
ly challenges you as a person," said senior
reliever A.J. Vanegas, who first spoke with
Filter over the phone on a recruiting call
while Filter was still coaching at SDSU.
"He realizes we got here for a reason with
our mechanics and doesn't really touch
that unless it's a glaring problem. But he
challenges you mentally to become the
best player you can be."

"One of the things that people don't
understand about him is that he's very
mentally strong," Vanegas added. "Our
whole pitching staff feeds off of his men
tality and intensity."

Some of that strength, and perhaps
even a chip on his shoulder, shaped Fil
ter's childhood.

"Coach [Filter] would always give us
stories of when he was a kid. He was the
youngest of a number of brothers and he
hung out with the older kids, wanting to
fit in," Appel said. "But his older brothers
and all their friends kind of picked on him.
He always sees that as an example of
