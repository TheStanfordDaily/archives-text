## PITCHING COACH HAS PROVEN HE CAN DEVELOP TALENT 
### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
He developed two pitchers to No. 1
selections in the MLB Draft over the last
five years and has had 65 of his pitchers
drafted over his last 20 seasons of coach
ing. He has mentored a pitching staff this
season that has more than held its own

and has been dominant at times, despite
having 60.8 percent of innings pitched by
the freshman pitchers through Tuesday.
Stanford pitching coach Rusty Filter is
no stranger to talent. But when you watch
his former players excel as upperclassmen
and in the big leagues, it's easy to overlook
the key role that he played in their ascent.
Filter is in his fifth season on the

Farm after spending 21 combined years at
San Diego State as a student-athlete and
assistant coach. His San Diego State pitch
ing staffs led the Mountain West Confer
ence in ERA in six of the league's first 10
seasons, and he has since built Stanford's
staff from both the recruiting and coach
ing standpoints. Still, his accolades that
stand out the most are the two No. 1 over
all draft picks.

Both SDSU pitcher Stephen Stras
burg and Mark Appel 'l3 faced challenges
and were doubted early on in their colle
giate careers. Strasburg faced an uphill
battle getting into strong physical shape
during his freshman season and Appel had
to overcome a taxing first year and develop
new pitches in order to do so.
For Filter, the mental side of the game
building up the confidence and mental
toughness of his student-athletes was a
large part of coaching strategy for those
two players and continues to be important
with his young staff this season.
"Coach Filter is interesting. He works
more on the mental side of the game than
any other coach I've worked with. He real
ly challenges you as a person," said senior
reliever A.J. Vanegas, who first spoke with
Filter over the phone on a recruiting call
while Filter was still coaching at SDSU.
"He realizes we got here for a reason with
our mechanics and doesn't really touch
that unless it's a glaring problem. But he
challenges you mentally to become the
best player you can be."

"One of the things that people don't
understand about him is that he's very
mentally strong," Vanegas added. "Our
whole pitching staff feeds off of his men
tality and intensity."

Some of that strength, and perhaps
even a chip on his shoulder, shaped Fil
ter's childhood.

"Coach [Filter] would always give us
stories of when he was a kid. He was the
youngest of a number of brothers and he
hung out with the older kids, wanting to
fit in," Appel said. "But his older brothers
and all their friends kind of picked on him.
He always sees that as an example of

Appel '13, one of two No. 1 overall MLB draft picks Filter has developed.
telling us where he came from and telling us
the mentality that he had and how he's kind
of had to overcome being the little guy."
Filter also challenges his student-ath
letes with his pitching strategy: getting ahead
in counts and staying aggressive on the
mound.

"Philosophy-wise, we're aggressive by
nature between the lines. We're really going
to push the envelope in everything that we
do. And the strength side of it is really impor
tant to me being fit to pitch," Filter said.
"The first thing is testing them a little bit
physically and then understanding that we're
going to be a fastball-first program."
Though the Cardinal do pride them
selves in being able to command that funda
mental pitch, Appel's struggles in his fresh
man season a 5.92 ERA in 38 innings out
of the bullpen mostly originated from
having just one pitch: his fastball.
"People assume that he was a star com
ing in, but Mark didn't pitch very well his
freshman year," said head coach Mark Mar
quess. "Then Coach Filter got to work with
him and he really developed. [Appel] really
grew under Coach Filter's tutelage and
coaching."
In his senior season at Monte Vista High
School in San Ramon, Calif., Appel was even
removed from his team's starting rotation
and relegated to the bullpen in favor of other
pitchers who were thought to be more tal
ented. (Christian Jones, who went on to play
for Oregon after high school, was one of
those starters; he was selected just 551 picks
after Appel in the 2013 MLB Draft.)

"He threw a lot of fastballs as a freshman
because he couldn't throw anything else for
a strike," Filter recalls. "But I had the data; I
told him, 'Mark, you have a great slider but
you throw it for a strike 20 percent of the
time. When the count goes 2-2, a number
one is going down.' He was frustrated with
that and so he went out that summer and his
goal was to come back with a changeup and
have command with his slider."

As they say, the rest was history, as Ap
pel came back to the Farm after playing in
the New England Collegiate Baseball League
over the summer with a revamped collection
of pitches in his repertoire. He won the Fri
day night starting job in the preseason and
essentially held the job until his graduation.
The two-time First Team All-American

etched his name into the top-10 of nearly
every statistical category in Stanford's record
book after a transformation that began in his
freshman year and continued throughout his
collegiate career.
"It was really all mental the key stuff
what I learned from [Coach Filter]," Appel
said. "He's a guy who's seen a lot of really
good players, he's not impressed by talent
and he's a guy that respects hard work. He
wants guys who don't get too high on them
selves when they pitch well, and also don't
get too down on themselves when they
aren't pitching well. He wants a guy that'll go
out and be a bulldog who will go out and
give seven, eight, or nine innings every time
out."

"I wasn't that guy freshman year. I wanted
to be that guy, but I wasn't," Appel added.
"But through our conversations, what we
worked on on the field, through understand
ing the game, understanding situations and
understanding how to be a starting pitcher, I
was able to work on those things both at
school and at summer ball, knowing that the
stuff I learned under Coach Filter helped me
become a better pitcher."
The Cardinal pitching staff this season
has been made up predominantly by under
classmen, to such an extent that they sent
out an unprecedented 27 consecutive first
year starters to begin the season. It goes
without saying that the team misses Appel's
consistency and dominance in the rotation,
especially having some of the toughest com
petition in the country in already having
played six ranked teams.

"The schedule was a killer schedule
the people that we played this year. So the
challenge was that they're very young, and
the concern that you have is that you throw
them in the deep end and they can't swim,"
Marquess said. "They struggled earlier but

they came through it and that's a credit to
him. Not only the mechanics, but the mental
aspect too and that's critical with young
pitchers."
Cal Quantrill, Stanford's first freshman
Opening Day starter since Mike Mussina got
the nod in 1988, has strongly improved after
a tough couple of outings to begin the sea
son. Over his last seven starts, Quantrill is 3-
1 with a 1.64 ERA after going 0-2 with a
14.52 ERA in his first two starts.
Freshman Brett ffanewich has also been
steady throughout the year, and boasts a
3.48 ERA over eight starts entering his
Thursday appearance against Arizona State.
Classmate Chris Viall, who began the season
as the team's Sunday starter, was roughed-up
in his last two starts but had previously held
the Cardinal close in games against strong
competition. But still, there's room for devel
opment, which could be a scary thought for
Stanford's future opponents.
"They all pitched very well in the fall.
The one thing is if you're young or you're
fighting for a spot, you'll have a tendency to
try to throw the perfect pitch every time.
And we're kind of in that situation. We'll get

in trouble because we're behind in counts or
we give up free passes and things like that,"
Filter said. "But the young guys have the abil
ity. They have big arms, but they have the
ability to throw secondary stuff for strikes.
The future is bright any time you get a
chance to return that number of quality guys
on the mound."

Regardless of how this season ends, the
young Stanford pitching staff should be con
fident about its future, given Filter's proven
ability to personally connect with his players
and develop their mental approaches.
"He's someone who really cares about
every pitcher â€”he really wants the best.
He's not going to beat around the bush, he's
going to give it to you straightforward let
ting you know what you need to do to get
better and get more playing time," Appel
said. "He's somebody that really cares about
each and every player that's there and really
wants the best for them and really wants to
maximize their potential."

telling us where he came from and telling us
the mentality that he had and how he's kind
of had to overcome being the little guy."
Filter also challenges his student-ath
letes with his pitching strategy: getting ahead
in counts and staying aggressive on the
mound.

"Philosophy-wise, we're aggressive by
nature between the lines. We're really going
to push the envelope in everything that we
do. And the strength side of it is really impor
tant to me being fit to pitch," Filter said.
"The first thing is testing them a little bit
physically and then understanding that we're
going to be a fastball-first program."
Though the Cardinal do pride them
selves in being able to command that funda
mental pitch, Appel's struggles in his fresh
man season a 5.92 ERA in 38 innings out
of the bullpen mostly originated from
having just one pitch: his fastball.
"People assume that he was a star com
ing in, but Mark didn't pitch very well his
freshman year," said head coach Mark Mar
quess. "Then Coach Filter got to work with
him and he really developed. [Appel] really
grew under Coach Filter's tutelage and
coaching."
In his senior season at Monte Vista High
School in San Ramon, Calif., Appel was even
removed from his team's starting rotation
and relegated to the bullpen in favor of other
pitchers who were thought to be more tal
ented. (Christian Jones, who went on to play
for Oregon after high school, was one of
those starters; he was selected just 551 picks
after Appel in the 2013 MLB Draft.)

"He threw a lot of fastballs as a freshman
because he couldn't throw anything else for
a strike," Filter recalls. "But I had the data; I
told him, 'Mark, you have a great slider but
you throw it for a strike 20 percent of the
time. When the count goes 2-2, a number
one is going down.' He was frustrated with
that and so he went out that summer and his
goal was to come back with a changeup and
have command with his slider."

As they say, the rest was history, as Ap
pel came back to the Farm after playing in
the New England Collegiate Baseball League
over the summer with a revamped collection
of pitches in his repertoire. He won the Fri
day night starting job in the preseason and
essentially held the job until his graduation.
The two-time First Team All-American

etched his name into the top-10 of nearly
every statistical category in Stanford's record
book after a transformation that began in his
freshman year and continued throughout his
collegiate career.
"It was really all mental the key stuff
what I learned from [Coach Filter]," Appel
said. "He's a guy who's seen a lot of really
good players, he's not impressed by talent
and he's a guy that respects hard work. He
wants guys who don't get too high on them
selves when they pitch well, and also don't
get too down on themselves when they
aren't pitching well. He wants a guy that'll go
out and be a bulldog who will go out and
give seven, eight, or nine innings every time
out."

"I wasn't that guy freshman year. I wanted
to be that guy, but I wasn't," Appel added.
"But through our conversations, what we
worked on on the field, through understand
ing the game, understanding situations and
understanding how to be a starting pitcher, I
was able to work on those things both at
school and at summer ball, knowing that the
stuff I learned under Coach Filter helped me
become a better pitcher."
The Cardinal pitching staff this season
has been made up predominantly by under
classmen, to such an extent that they sent
out an unprecedented 27 consecutive first
year starters to begin the season. It goes
without saying that the team misses Appel's
consistency and dominance in the rotation,
especially having some of the toughest com
petition in the country in already having
played six ranked teams.

"The schedule was a killer schedule
the people that we played this year. So the
challenge was that they're very young, and
the concern that you have is that you throw
them in the deep end and they can't swim,"
Marquess said. "They struggled earlier but

they came through it and that's a credit to
him. Not only the mechanics, but the mental
aspect too and that's critical with young
pitchers."
Cal Quantrill, Stanford's first freshman
Opening Day starter since Mike Mussina got
the nod in 1988, has strongly improved after
a tough couple of outings to begin the sea
son. Over his last seven starts, Quantrill is 3-
1 with a 1.64 ERA after going 0-2 with a
14.52 ERA in his first two starts.
Freshman Brett ffanewich has also been
steady throughout the year, and boasts a
3.48 ERA over eight starts entering his
Thursday appearance against Arizona State.
Classmate Chris Viall, who began the season
as the team's Sunday starter, was roughed-up
in his last two starts but had previously held
the Cardinal close in games against strong
competition. But still, there's room for devel
opment, which could be a scary thought for
Stanford's future opponents.
"They all pitched very well in the fall.
The one thing is if you're young or you're
fighting for a spot, you'll have a tendency to
try to throw the perfect pitch every time.
And we're kind of in that situation. We'll get

in trouble because we're behind in counts or
we give up free passes and things like that,"
Filter said. "But the young guys have the abil
ity. They have big arms, but they have the
ability to throw secondary stuff for strikes.
The future is bright any time you get a
chance to return that number of quality guys
on the mound."

Regardless of how this season ends, the
young Stanford pitching staff should be con
fident about its future, given Filter's proven
ability to personally connect with his players
and develop their mental approaches.
"He's someone who really cares about
every pitcher â€”he really wants the best.
He's not going to beat around the bush, he's
going to give it to you straightforward let
ting you know what you need to do to get
better and get more playing time," Appel
said. "He's somebody that really cares about
each and every player that's there and really
wants the best for them and really wants to
maximize their potential."

MARK APPEL 'l3
He developed two pitchers to No. 1
selections in the MLB Draft over the last
five years and has had 65 of his pitchers
drafted over his last 20 seasons of coach
ing. He has mentored a pitching staff this
season that has more than held its own

and has been dominant at times, despite
having 60.8 percent of innings pitched by
the freshman pitchers through Tuesday.
Stanford pitching coach Rusty Filter is
no stranger to talent. But when you watch
his former players excel as upperclassmen
and in the big leagues, it's easy to overlook
the key role that he played in their ascent.
Filter is in his fifth season on the

Farm after spending 21 combined years at
San Diego State as a student-athlete and
assistant coach. His San Diego State pitch
ing staffs led the Mountain West Confer
ence in ERA in six of the league's first 10
seasons, and he has since built Stanford's
staff from both the recruiting and coach
ing standpoints. Still, his accolades that
stand out the most are the two No. 1 over
all draft picks.

Both SDSU pitcher Stephen Stras
burg and Mark Appel 'l3 faced challenges
and were doubted early on in their colle
giate careers. Strasburg faced an uphill
battle getting into strong physical shape
during his freshman season and Appel had
to overcome a taxing first year and develop
new pitches in order to do so.
For Filter, the mental side of the game
building up the confidence and mental
toughness of his student-athletes was a
large part of coaching strategy for those
two players and continues to be important
with his young staff this season.
"Coach Filter is interesting. He works
more on the mental side of the game than
any other coach I've worked with. He real
ly challenges you as a person," said senior
reliever A.J. Vanegas, who first spoke with
Filter over the phone on a recruiting call
while Filter was still coaching at SDSU.
"He realizes we got here for a reason with
our mechanics and doesn't really touch
that unless it's a glaring problem. But he
challenges you mentally to become the
best player you can be."

"One of the things that people don't
understand about him is that he's very
mentally strong," Vanegas added. "Our
whole pitching staff feeds off of his men
tality and intensity."

Some of that strength, and perhaps
even a chip on his shoulder, shaped Fil
ter's childhood.

"Coach [Filter] would always give us
stories of when he was a kid. He was the
youngest of a number of brothers and he
hung out with the older kids, wanting to
fit in," Appel said. "But his older brothers
and all their friends kind of picked on him.
He always sees that as an example of

wants guys who don't get too high on them
selves when they pitch well, and also don't
get too down on themselves when they
aren't pitching well. He wants a guy that'll go
out and be a bulldog who will go out and
give seven, eight, or nine innings every time
out."

"I wasn't that guy freshman year. I wanted
to be that guy, but I wasn't," Appel added.
"But through our conversations, what we
worked on on the field, through understand
ing the game, understanding situations and
understanding how to be a starting pitcher, I
was able to work on those things both at
school and at summer ball, knowing that the
stuff I learned under Coach Filter helped me
become a better pitcher."
The Cardinal pitching staff this season
has been made up predominantly by under
classmen, to such an extent that they sent
out an unprecedented 27 consecutive first
year starters to begin the season. It goes
without saying that the team misses Appel's
consistency and dominance in the rotation,
especially having some of the toughest com
petition in the country in already having
played six ranked teams.

"The schedule was a killer schedule
the people that we played this year. So the
challenge was that they're very young, and
the concern that you have is that you throw
them in the deep end and they can't swim,"
Marquess said. "They struggled earlier but

they came through it and that's a credit to
him. Not only the mechanics, but the mental
aspect too and that's critical with young
pitchers."
Cal Quantrill, Stanford's first freshman
Opening Day starter since Mike Mussina got
the nod in 1988, has strongly improved after
a tough couple of outings to begin the sea
son. Over his last seven starts, Quantrill is 3-
1 with a 1.64 ERA after going 0-2 with a
14.52 ERA in his first two starts.
Freshman Brett ffanewich has also been
steady throughout the year, and boasts a
3.48 ERA over eight starts entering his
Thursday appearance against Arizona State.
Classmate Chris Viall, who began the season
as the team's Sunday starter, was roughed-up
in his last two starts but had previously held
the Cardinal close in games against strong
competition. But still, there's room for devel
opment, which could be a scary thought for
Stanford's future opponents.
"They all pitched very well in the fall.
The one thing is if you're young or you're
fighting for a spot, you'll have a tendency to
try to throw the perfect pitch every time.
And we're kind of in that situation. We'll get

in trouble because we're behind in counts or
we give up free passes and things like that,"
Filter said. "But the young guys have the abil
ity. They have big arms, but they have the
ability to throw secondary stuff for strikes.
The future is bright any time you get a
chance to return that number of quality guys
on the mound."

Regardless of how this season ends, the
young Stanford pitching staff should be con
fident about its future, given Filter's proven
ability to personally connect with his players
and develop their mental approaches.
"He's someone who really cares about
every pitcher â€”he really wants the best.
He's not going to beat around the bush, he's
going to give it to you straightforward let
ting you know what you need to do to get
better and get more playing time," Appel
said. "He's somebody that really cares about
each and every player that's there and really
wants the best for them and really wants to
maximize their potential."

MARK APPEL 'l3
He developed two pitchers to No. 1
selections in the MLB Draft over the last
five years and has had 65 of his pitchers
drafted over his last 20 seasons of coach
ing. He has mentored a pitching staff this
season that has more than held its own

and has been dominant at times, despite
having 60.8 percent of innings pitched by
the freshman pitchers through Tuesday.
Stanford pitching coach Rusty Filter is
no stranger to talent. But when you watch
his former players excel as upperclassmen
and in the big leagues, it's easy to overlook
the key role that he played in their ascent.
Filter is in his fifth season on the

Farm after spending 21 combined years at
San Diego State as a student-athlete and
assistant coach. His San Diego State pitch
ing staffs led the Mountain West Confer
ence in ERA in six of the league's first 10
seasons, and he has since built Stanford's
staff from both the recruiting and coach
ing standpoints. Still, his accolades that
stand out the most are the two No. 1 over
all draft picks.

Both SDSU pitcher Stephen Stras
burg and Mark Appel 'l3 faced challenges
and were doubted early on in their colle
giate careers. Strasburg faced an uphill
battle getting into strong physical shape
during his freshman season and Appel had
to overcome a taxing first year and develop
new pitches in order to do so.
For Filter, the mental side of the game
building up the confidence and mental
toughness of his student-athletes was a
large part of coaching strategy for those
two players and continues to be important
with his young staff this season.
"Coach Filter is interesting. He works
more on the mental side of the game than
any other coach I've worked with. He real
ly challenges you as a person," said senior
reliever A.J. Vanegas, who first spoke with
Filter over the phone on a recruiting call
while Filter was still coaching at SDSU.
"He realizes we got here for a reason with
our mechanics and doesn't really touch
that unless it's a glaring problem. But he
challenges you mentally to become the
best player you can be."

"One of the things that people don't
understand about him is that he's very
mentally strong," Vanegas added. "Our
whole pitching staff feeds off of his men
tality and intensity."

Some of that strength, and perhaps
even a chip on his shoulder, shaped Fil
ter's childhood.

"Coach [Filter] would always give us
stories of when he was a kid. He was the
youngest of a number of brothers and he
hung out with the older kids, wanting to
fit in," Appel said. "But his older brothers
and all their friends kind of picked on him.
He always sees that as an example of

telling us where he came from and telling us
the mentality that he had and how he's kind
of had to overcome being the little guy."
Filter also challenges his student-ath
letes with his pitching strategy: getting ahead
in counts and staying aggressive on the
mound.

"Philosophy-wise, we're aggressive by
nature between the lines. We're really going
to push the envelope in everything that we
do. And the strength side of it is really impor
tant to me being fit to pitch," Filter said.
"The first thing is testing them a little bit
physically and then understanding that we're
going to be a fastball-first program."
Though the Cardinal do pride them
selves in being able to command that funda
mental pitch, Appel's struggles in his fresh
man season a 5.92 ERA in 38 innings out
of the bullpen mostly originated from
having just one pitch: his fastball.
"People assume that he was a star com
ing in, but Mark didn't pitch very well his
freshman year," said head coach Mark Mar
quess. "Then Coach Filter got to work with
him and he really developed. [Appel] really
grew under Coach Filter's tutelage and
coaching."
In his senior season at Monte Vista High
School in San Ramon, Calif., Appel was even
removed from his team's starting rotation
and relegated to the bullpen in favor of other
pitchers who were thought to be more tal
ented. (Christian Jones, who went on to play
for Oregon after high school, was one of
those starters; he was selected just 551 picks
after Appel in the 2013 MLB Draft.)

"He threw a lot of fastballs as a freshman
because he couldn't throw anything else for
a strike," Filter recalls. "But I had the data; I
told him, 'Mark, you have a great slider but
you throw it for a strike 20 percent of the
time. When the count goes 2-2, a number
one is going down.' He was frustrated with
that and so he went out that summer and his
goal was to come back with a changeup and
have command with his slider."

As they say, the rest was history, as Ap
pel came back to the Farm after playing in
the New England Collegiate Baseball League
over the summer with a revamped collection
of pitches in his repertoire. He won the Fri
day night starting job in the preseason and
essentially held the job until his graduation.
The two-time First Team All-American

etched his name into the top-10 of nearly
every statistical category in Stanford's record
book after a transformation that began in his
freshman year and continued throughout his
collegiate career.
"It was really all mental the key stuff
what I learned from [Coach Filter]," Appel
said. "He's a guy who's seen a lot of really
good players, he's not impressed by talent
and he's a guy that respects hard work. He
wants guys who don't get too high on them
selves when they pitch well, and also don't
get too down on themselves when they
aren't pitching well. He wants a guy that'll go
out and be a bulldog who will go out and
give seven, eight, or nine innings every time
out."

"I wasn't that guy freshman year. I wanted
to be that guy, but I wasn't," Appel added.
