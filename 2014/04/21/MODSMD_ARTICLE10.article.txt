## Stanford squeaks out narrow wins 
### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
In a tight series in which all
three games were decided by just
one run, Stanford's baseball team
(15-17, 6-9 Pac-12) took its first
steps to get back into the confer
ence race, taking two of three from
Arizona State (21-16, 10-8) â€”win-
ning Thursday's and Saturday's
games 4-3 and 1-0, respectively,

while dropping Friday night's con
test 3-2.

"[The series win] is important,"
said senior reliever A.J. Vanegas.
"We were kind of behind the eight
ball, and Danny [Diekroeger] be

fore the game, talked about how
these are like playoff games.
Every game from here on out is
going to be a must win to get to the
playoffs."
Senior first baseman Danny
Diekroeger capped off a monster
week as he provided the game-win
ning hits in both of Stanford's wins
in the series after he also had a
walk-off single in Tuesday's win
over St. Mary's. On Thursday

night, after a comeback effort in
the eighth inning to tie the game at
three, Diekroeger stepped up with
two outs and a runner on second to
deliver his second walk-off single
in as many games. On Sunday, his
fourth-inning solo homer provided
the sole run of the game en route
to a Stanford win.
Over his last four games,

Diekroeger has hit .412 (7-for-17)
with 3 RBIs, improving vastly on
his performance over his previous
nine games, in which he hit just
.143 (5-for-35) with 3 RBIs.
"I just happen to get up in those
situations, so I was looking forward
to helping the team win some
games like that," Diekroeger said.
"I was a little down with the bat the
past two weeks before this so I was
trying to come back and have a
good week."
"For the most part, he was a lit
tle anxious [over the slump]. He's
calmed down a little bit and let the
ball come to him a bit more," said
head coach Mark Marquess. "He's
smart. He knows himself and he's
worked hard on it. He's very con
sistent and knows what he needs to
do to hit. And this was his best
weekend."
In Thursday's game, Arizona
State jumped out to a quick lead
and knocked freshman Brett
Hanewich out of the game early,
scoring two runs in the first and one
in the fourth. The Cardinal were
shut out until the eighth inning,
when they managed to tie the game
up at three.
With two outs in the eighth, jun
ior Dominic Jose stepped up in a
pinch-hit opportunity with a two
run double down the right-field line
to narrow the Sun Devil lead to 3-2.
The next hitter, freshman Tommy
Edman, who was pinch-hitting for
sophomore Drew Jackson, deliv
ered an RBI single to score Jose
and even the score.
In the ninth, Arizona State got
two quick outs before the Cardinal
began to rally. Junior Austin Slater
and sophomore Zach Hoffpauir
drew consecutive walks to put the
game-winning run in scoring posi
tion with Diekroeger due up. The
first baseman lined a 2-0 single into
right field to easily score Slater and
secure the comeback win.
Despite Diekroeger's heroics,
the Cardinal offense continued its
slumber, scoring just seven runs as
a team over the three-game set. But
their pitching staff held the Sun
Devils who entered the series
ranked third in the conference with
a .294 batting average against Pac
-12 opponents to just six runs and
a .179 average in the series. Stan
ford's bullpen in particular has been
lights-out as of late, as it is current
ly riding a 12-inning scoreless
streak.
On Friday, in front of a crowd of
1,771, the largest crowd at Sunken
Diamond on a Friday so far this
season, freshman Cal Quantrill
started off strong, striking out
three of the first five hitters he
faced, effectively working in his off
speed pitches to keep the Sun Dev
il hitters off balanced.
Yet later in the game, mistakes
proved costly for the Cardinal, as a
dropped pop-up by senior Alex
Blandino and two wild pitches all
in the third inning allowed Ari
zona State to jump out to a 3-0 lead
once again.
Stanford would rally in the bot
tom of the sixth, taking advantage
of an error by the ASU shortstop
with two outs. Freshman Alex Dun
lap had an RBI single, which scored
two runs after a misplay by the left
fielder that allowed the ball to roll
all the way to the wall.
Quantrill, who leads the team
with 49 strikeouts this season
more than twice the amount of his
runner-up, Hanewich finished
the day with six innings pitched and
three runs allowed, with one
earned.
The Cardinal had a chance to tie

the game in the bottom of the ninth
in yet another comeback effort, as
Edman had a pinch-hit double to
lead off the inning. But Jackson
popped up a bunt and the next two
hitters were retired as Arizona
State squeaked out its only win of
the series.
Junior John Hochstatter had
the team's strongest start of the
weekend, as he continued to cement
his position as the Cardinal's third
starter after taking over the role
from freshman Chris Viall last Sun
day in Washington. The Danville,
Calif., native pitched 7.2 shutout in
nings, allowing just three total hits
against Arizona State in Saturday's
win, lowering his season's ERA to a
team-best 2.18. Hochstatter had a
no-hitter going through 5.1 innings
before allowing a single to Sun
Devils junior Nate Causey.
Hochstatter's start was the sto
ry of Saturday's game, as the Sun
Devil hitters were being aggressive
at the plate and making a lot of con
tact. Although Hochstatter had
just one strikeout in the game, the
Sun Devils were unable to get solid
contact. Diekroeger's homer pro
vided all the run support Hochstat
ter needed before Vanegas, who
has been dominant since retuning
from a back injury mid-season,

came in for the 1.2-inning save.
Over 18.1 innings pitched, Vane
gas has yet to allow an earned run
and has pitched to a 0.82 WHIR
And each of his four saves this sea
son the most recent one coming
on Saturday afternoon in a 1-0
game have all come in outings
lasting longer than one inning.
"The slider and fastball have
been really good. But the biggest
change for me has been mentality"
Vanegas said. "Before, I used to
think a lot about my pitches and try
to correct it. Now, it's just about go
ing out there and attacking the hit
ters. If you throw a ball, so be it. 'So
what' is what we say in the dugout.
That's the mindset you have to take
out there, especially when you're
pitching in the ninth when every
body is going crazy when you
throw one ball."
The Cardinal will look to take
advantage of some weaker compe
tition ahead, but they have a busy
week. The team travels to Santa
Clara on Tuesday and St. Mary's
on Wednesday before welcoming
Cal to Sunken Diamond in a three
game series that starts on Satur
day afternoon.
