## Stanford squeaks out narrow wins 
### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
In a tight series in which all
three games were decided by just
one run, Stanford's baseball team
(15-17, 6-9 Pac-12) took its first
steps to get back into the confer
ence race, taking two of three from
Arizona State (21-16, 10-8) â€”win-
ning Thursday's and Saturday's
games 4-3 and 1-0, respectively,

while dropping Friday night's con
test 3-2.

"[The series win] is important,"
said senior reliever A.J. Vanegas.
"We were kind of behind the eight
ball, and Danny [Diekroeger] be

fore the game, talked about how
these are like playoff games.
Every game from here on out is
going to be a must win to get to the
playoffs."
Senior first baseman Danny
Diekroeger capped off a monster
week as he provided the game-win
ning hits in both of Stanford's wins
in the series after he also had a
walk-off single in Tuesday's win
over St. Mary's. On Thursday

night, after a comeback effort in
the eighth inning to tie the game at
three, Diekroeger stepped up with
two outs and a runner on second to
deliver his second walk-off single
in as many games. On Sunday, his
fourth-inning solo homer provided
the sole run of the game en route
to a Stanford win.
Over his last four games,
