## Disaster barely averted 
### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Faced with the possibility of
getting swept by Utah and likely
seeing any postseason aspirations
disappear into the thin Rocky
Mountain air, Stanford softball
(26-18,3-12 Pac-12) staged its sec
ond remarkable comeback in Pac
-12 play this year to knock off the
Utes (20-20,5-12 Pac-12) in Satur
day's series finale. After the
tough series loss, though, the
Card will certainly have a lot of
work to do over the final 11 games
of this regular season, starting
when they welcome the No. 1
Oregon Ducks (40-5,14-1 Pac-12)
to the Farm this coming weekend.

For the first two games of the
Utah series, a series crucial for
both teams' postseason hopes,
the Cardinal did not pitch well
enough to win, as Utah claimed
victories on Thursday and Fri
day afternoon. On Thursday, the
Card could not hold onto an ear
ly 7-0 lead, with the Utes scor
ing 12 unanswered runs to stun
