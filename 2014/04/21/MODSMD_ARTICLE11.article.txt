## Disaster barely averted 
### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Faced with the possibility of
getting swept by Utah and likely
seeing any postseason aspirations
disappear into the thin Rocky
Mountain air, Stanford softball
(26-18,3-12 Pac-12) staged its sec
ond remarkable comeback in Pac
-12 play this year to knock off the
Utes (20-20,5-12 Pac-12) in Satur
day's series finale. After the
tough series loss, though, the
Card will certainly have a lot of
work to do over the final 11 games
of this regular season, starting
when they welcome the No. 1
Oregon Ducks (40-5,14-1 Pac-12)
to the Farm this coming weekend.

For the first two games of the
Utah series, a series crucial for
both teams' postseason hopes,
the Cardinal did not pitch well
enough to win, as Utah claimed
victories on Thursday and Fri
day afternoon. On Thursday, the
Card could not hold onto an ear
ly 7-0 lead, with the Utes scor
ing 12 unanswered runs to stun

Stanford 12-7.
Utah's fine form at the plate
continued early in Friday after
noon's matchup, as the Cardinal's
pitching could not keep up in the
first inning with the explosive Utes
offense. Utah scored seven runs in
the bottom of the first before hold
ing off Stanford's bats long enough
to pick up the 8-3 win. The Utes
spoiled junior Tyiyn Wells's strong
day in the circle, as the junior from
Concord, Calif., nearly went the
distance in relief of freshman
starter Madi Schreyer. Wells gave
up only three earned runs in 5.2 in
nings of work in the losing effort.
On Saturday morning, it ap
peared initially that the narrative
from Thursday and Friday would
repeat itself. Utah held a seeming
ly insurmountable lead of 10-3 en
tering the top of the sixth inning, as
poor pitching and three costly er
rors that translated into eight un
earned runs appeared to have
doomed Stanford. However, the
cardiac Cardinal had another
comeback in store for their fans.
After junior Cassandra
Roulund notched an infield single
to lead off the sixth inning, fresh
man Bessie Noll began the rally in
earnest with a double to right field.
After junior Hanna Winter reached
on an error by Utes second base
man Hannah Flippen to load the
bases, sophomore Jessica Plaza
drove home the first run of the in
ning on a fielder's choice to cut the
deficit to 10-4.
Prior to reaching the top of
Stanford's lineup, Wells provided
yet another clutch hit for the Car

dinal, tripling into the right-center
field gap to score Winter and Plaza.
With the Utes' lead cut to four, jun
ior Leah White notched her sec
ond RBI on the day with a single
up the middle into center field. Fi
nally, after sophomore Kayla Bon
strom hit a single down the left
field line, freshman Kylie Soren
son completed the comeback with
a blast over the left field fence to
tie the game at 10.
However, while the Card had
tied the game in the sixth, the busi
ness of winning Saturday's finale
would have to be sealed in the top
of the seventh inning. With runners
on second and third, White would
become the hero with a drive to left
field, with the single scoring both
Plaza from second and Winter from
third.
Although the Utes would score
a run in the bottom of the seventh,
the margin would ultimately hold,
and Stanford finally outlasted Utah
12-11 in a two hour and 52 minute
marathon.
White's game-winning single

was not the only clutch piece of hit
ting for the Phoenix native, as the
junior led the team this weekend
with six RBIs. She also hit .500
with nine total bases and three
runs scored. White even un
leashed the long ball in her
standout performance this week
end, with a leadoff solo shot in
the top of the first inning on
Thursday. In a sense, White's play
would provide both the opening
and closing statements for the Car
dinal in Salt Lake City.
Junior Erin Ashby once again
had another outstanding series for
Stanford, as the junior from La
Crescenta, Calif., slugged .900 with
a home run, a double and five RBIs
in the three games this weekend.
Ashby also managed to tie White
for the team lead in total bases with
nine, while matching White's bat
ting average with a .500 mark on
five hits.
Ashby's best showing in Salt
Lake City came in the opener on
Thursday, as she reached base
safely in all four plate appearances
with four RBIs, two walks and two
extra base-hits. In her first time at
the plate, Ashby followed up
White's homer in the top of the first
with a blast of her own, as she ab
solutely unloaded on the 1-2 deliv
ery from Utes starter Sammy Cor
dova. Subsequently, Ashby would
lace a double in the top of the sec
ond inning to plate two more runs
and set a new career high for RBIs
in a single game.
Stanford returns to action on
Tuesday evening against the Santa
Clara Broncos (7-26, 2-4 WCC) be
fore squaring off against No.l Ore
gon on Friday, Saturday and Sun
day at Smith Family Stadium.
