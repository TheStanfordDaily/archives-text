# CARDINAL DOMINANCE
## Stanford extends win streak over rival Cal to 37 straight matches 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
It doesn't look like there's any
team in this country that can
stop Stanford women's water polo
right now.
With the Pac-12 Networks in
the house for the annual install
ment of the Big Splash, No. 1 Stan
ford (20-1, 6-0 MPSF) claimed its
37th consecutive victory over rival
No. 4 California (17-7, 2-4) by a

score of 9-6 on Senior Day at Av
ery Aquatic Center. In doing so,
the Cardinal defeated their
fourth top-five opponent in their
last five matches to end their reg
ular season on perhaps the most
dominant streak in the nation.

Although Stanford had already
clinched the top seed in the up
coming MPSF Tournament with
its blowout victory over Cal State-
Bakersfield a week ago, Saturday
offered the five departing seniors

on the team Kaley Dodson, An
nika Dries, Kaitlyn Lo, Lexie
Ross and Kelsey Suggs the op
portunity to extend Stanford's
winning streak over its cross-Bay
rival in their final regular-season
home match and keep the ball
rolling heading into the tourna
ment.
The match itself was a tale of
two halves for the teams, with
both offenses getting off to good
starts in the first half before the
defenses dominated the second
half. Although Stanford took a
quick 4-1 lead after the first
quarter on the back of goals from

Sophomore driver Maggie Steffens (right) scored a goal in the Big Splash against Cal on Saturday to
stretch her season total to 38 and is one of five Cardinal players to have more than 30 goals this year.
the Neushul sisters, sophomore
driver Maggie Steffens and soph
omore driver Anna Yelizarova, the
Bears pushed back and made it a
close match late in the first half.
Senior Ashley Young scored a
goal for the Bears and freshman
Dora Antal punched in another to
add to her conference-leading 64
goals on the season as Cal refused
to lie down, trimming the deficit
to 4-3. With Stanford and Cal al
ternating two goals each in the re
mainder of the first half, the 6-5
halftime score looked to give the
Bears a fighting chance at the up
set heading into the second half.
But Stanford's defense, led by
sophomore goalkeeper Gabby
Stone, put those chances to rest
after the break.
After a monumental perform
ance in which she netted 17 saves
in Stanford's victory over then-
No. 1 USC almost a month ago,
Stone has been fantastic between
the bars down the stretch against
some of the most explosive offens
es in the nation, and that certainly
showed on Saturday.
Stone added nine more saves
against Cal and limited the Bears
to just one goal in the second half,
which the Cardinal needed as Caf
freshman goalie Madeline Trabuc
co also buckled down and made
some fantastic saves in the second

half to limit the Cardinal offense
in a third period in which both of
fenses combined for just one goal.
That goal, which came on a fast
break after a Cardinal steal by
Dries, gave junior Ashley Gross
man her second goal of the game to
give Stanford a 7-5 lead and some
breathing room.
Cal's Young almost got the
Bears back in the match midway
through the fourth period when
she was able to get off a skip shot
that skidded off the crossbar. Af
ter that, the remainder of the
fourth period went much more
smoothly for the Cardinal offense,
with Yelizarova and Dries both
netting power-play goals over a
two-minute period late in the
match to give Stanford a four
point lead that Cal was unable to
surmount.
The fact that seven different
players scored on the evening for

the Cardinal was again indicative
of a strong offense characterized
by a diversity of scoring, with two
40-goal scorers in Grossman and
Kiley Neushul and three more
knocking on the door with over 30
goals apiece in Dries, Steffens and
Yelizarova.
With the win, Stanford's de
fense extended its impressive
streak of limiting opponents to
single digits in goals to 12 match
es, while the Cardinal as a team
extended their winning streak to a
season-high of 11 matches.
And as icing on the cake after a
hard-fought rivalry match, Stan
ford found out afterwards that
No. 2 USC which many had ex
pected to be Stanford's toughest
opposition for the national title
had been toppled by No. 3 UCLA,
which Stanford had already de
feated a week earlier.
Thus, going into next week
end's MPSF Tournament, Stan
ford should not only be a heavy fa
vorite to claim its first conference
championship since 2006, but also
should be the top-ranked team in
the nation by a wider margin and
the team to beat moving forward
into the postseason.
As the top seed, Stanford will
receive a first-round bye in this
weekend's MPSF Tournament
and will play in the semifinals at
2:30 p.m. on Saturday against the
winner of the match between No. 4
Cal and No. 5 San Jose State.
