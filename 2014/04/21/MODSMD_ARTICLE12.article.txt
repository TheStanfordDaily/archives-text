# CARDINAL DOMINANCE
## Stanford extends win streak over rival Cal to 37 straight matches 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
It doesn't look like there's any
team in this country that can
stop Stanford women's water polo
right now.
With the Pac-12 Networks in
the house for the annual install
ment of the Big Splash, No. 1 Stan
ford (20-1, 6-0 MPSF) claimed its
37th consecutive victory over rival
No. 4 California (17-7, 2-4) by a

score of 9-6 on Senior Day at Av
ery Aquatic Center. In doing so,
the Cardinal defeated their
fourth top-five opponent in their
last five matches to end their reg
ular season on perhaps the most
dominant streak in the nation.

Although Stanford had already
clinched the top seed in the up
coming MPSF Tournament with
its blowout victory over Cal State-
Bakersfield a week ago, Saturday
offered the five departing seniors

on the team Kaley Dodson, An
nika Dries, Kaitlyn Lo, Lexie
Ross and Kelsey Suggs the op
portunity to extend Stanford's
winning streak over its cross-Bay
rival in their final regular-season
home match and keep the ball
rolling heading into the tourna
ment.
The match itself was a tale of
two halves for the teams, with
both offenses getting off to good
starts in the first half before the
defenses dominated the second
half. Although Stanford took a
quick 4-1 lead after the first
quarter on the back of goals from
