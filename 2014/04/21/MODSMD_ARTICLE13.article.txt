## Things are pretty okay: Acceptance versus indifference 
### FROM THE OPINIONS DESK Winston Shi 
Stanford is a defining example of
how the issues most important
to us nobody really under
stands. Take the most famous exam
ple, the so-called Stanford bubble, a
term so übiquitous that the Admis
sions Office is now using it in its re
cruiting strategies. What is the Stan
ford bubble? Like the term syn
drome in medical parlance, the term
"Stanford bubble," along with "duck
syndrome" and "techie-fuzzy" is
something that we say to describe
phenomena that nobody really un
derstands. Put together, these three
concepts can be used to describe any
kind of dissatisfaction we might have
with a campus that ultimately makes
it distasteful to have distaste for any
aspect of it.
Why can't we be unhappy about
Stanford? There are two ways to ap
proach it, one fundamentally repres
sive and the other fundamentally ac
cepting. I said earlier that plenty of
Stanford applicants deserve to enter
the University, while only a few of
them actually will. That is true. But
the full truth is that while plenty of
applicants deserve to enter Stanford
University as it actually is, nobody
deserves to be here as we imagine it.
If you're taking that as a negative
towards Stanford, you'd be wrong.
Stanford is a great place. Yet I ask
everyone here —what did you envi
sion Stanford as being when you first
stepped on this campus? I assume
that your view is different now.
To generalize, the popular con
ception of Stanford seems to be the
place where everything is perfect.
The great universities of the East
Coast are generally cast as institu
tions that are imperfect but that nev
ertheless have a certain weighty dig
nity to them. Stanford markets itself
as a place that has no drawbacks
one that can actually be all things to
all people.
What's the point of selling Stan
ford's resources? It allows Stanford
to sell ourselves to ourselves. Natu
rally, people dream of Stanford in the
ways that suits them most the
way that allows them to imagine
their own dreams being realized, the
way that ultimately allows them to
feel best about themselves. Before
we become students here the Uni
versity is a blank slate, and we al
most always see fit to make it our
blank slate. Stanford, we imagine,
will give us the tools to accomplish all
our dreams, to do everything we
could have ever imagined and then
some. In doing so, it will, in short,
make us perfect, and confirm our
own hidden hopes of perfection. I ad
mit that I was one of these people. It
happens. It's quite unavoidable.
But I can't help but feel a little
squeamish when the University tries
to confirm these dreams after we ar
rive, even though they cannot all be
true. It wasn't long ago that I was
sitting in Memorial Auditorium for
New Student Orientation and the
keynote speaker confidently de
clared, "Stanford validates who you
already are."
If there's anything that the Uni
versity should do, it should be to di
rectly deny that thesis. We aren't
perfect, and our perfection then
can't confirm the University's per
fection. We can become better be
cause of the resources that Stanford
provides us, for sure. There are
plenty of foibles we ourselves
would acknowledge that we hope
that college will eradicate. But
what often goes unnoticed is that
there are also always things funda
mental to ourselves and our own
aspirations that are flawed and
that must change. It is inherently
selfish to think that Stanford can
only be wonderful if it conforms to
your own sense of who you are and
what Stanford should be.

What, then? We blame the limita
tions of Stanford. We place our prob
lems on the Stanford bubble. The
thesis of our notorious bubble is that
our opportunities are not limitless,
as we had dreamed, but that they
are ultimately circumscribed by our
isolation. Similarly, the so-called
techie-fuzzy divide supposedly de
scribes our own internal circles of
distrust, where the culture of the
University forces us to be either one
or the other thus blaming our is
sues on society limiting our options
and desires, when in reality we are
mostly free to study as we choose.
The infamous duck syndrome,
then, is a quintessentially passive
aggressive mode of complaining
about these two fundamental com
plaints, and it's not healthy. It's
not healthy because it allows the
wounds caused by the fall of our as
pirations to fester. But because it al
so involves that stiff-lipped silence
on the outside, it also allows us to
dodge the fact that our aspirations
say everything about ourselves. If
our aspirations fail when every op
portunity is available to us, as we
know is false and yet still fear might
be true, then something is wrong
with us. And everybody is scared
about being wrong.
We are in denial and in full blame
society mode at the same time.

People say that in paradoxes such
as this, you should take a stance. Not
all stances are good, however, and in
particular, being okay with being
wrong is not the answer.
It is okay to be disappointed. It is
okay to realize that the University is
not and could never have been the
sum total of our wildest hopes and
dreams. Stanford is a great place
even if it isn't perfect, and there are
plenty of wonderful people here who
are wonderful even if they aren't per
fect themselves. I think Stanford is
awesome. Most people here would
agree, and I suppose that's why al
though the student body is pretty lib
eral, the mood of the campus is funda
mentally conservative. Regardless if
a student has disavowed duck syn
drome or is fully invested in it, his/her
motto is probably that of the xkcd
cartoon pictured here: "Things are
pretty okay." We're cool with what we
have. With a few exceptions, such as
(possibly I haven't asked him) the
columnist who shares the Monday
opinions page with me today, Stan
ford students are pretty happy with
the way things are.
We can be happy here even if we
aren't perfect. But though we have to
recognize this truth in order to un
derstand the University for what it
is, such a truth cannot be our final
goal. That sentiment veers towards
the complacency of indifference.
And indifference is a far more insid
ious redefinition of who we are and
what we seek to be. It is not a cause
for celebration when D. J.R. Bruckn
er writes of a "new cynicism" in the
Los Angeles Times. "What you hear
and see is not rage, but injury, a
withering of expectations," Bruckn
er pointed out. He wasn't happy. Nor
should we be.

#470 - "The End is Not For a While"

Our degrees are nice to have, and
the University's imprimatur opens
doors. We can't disagree on that
point. But if we are indifferent, it
would be far better for the Universi
ty to give a spot to somebody who ac
tually wants to do something mean
ingful with the opportunities we have
been given. Stanford's imperfections
are only acceptable because they
teach us that we have to redefine our
aspirations that we now have to
seek out the new new horizon. It is
only okay to realize that we are not
perfect ourselves as long as we ac
knowledge that perfection is still a
goal worthy of our efforts, hopes and
dreams.

One last musing on indifference.
I write this on Easter Sunday, a
day when Christians believe that Je

sus Christ was resurrected from the
dead. Christianity teaches that Je
sus chooses people to join Him in
that resurrection if they only place
their faith in Him and His calling.
Protestants believe in salvation by
faith alone; Catholics delay the
process a bit with the doctrine of
purgatory, but at least to my theo
logically untrained eyes, it seems
like both paths eventually arrive at
the same point.
Salvation through faith is a beau
tiful belief. It preaches not just re
demption but universal redemption,
and indeed the pastor who is raised in
the faith from birth is every bit the
same as the thief who embraces the
faith in his last moments, dying in
agony, impaled on the cross in one life
and saved in the next.
Yet the fundamental lesson of
Christianity is that surety in salva
tion is not enough. Even if we believe
that resurrection is certain, we can
not simply settle for that. To believe
that God loves us despite our short
comings is faith; to believe that God's

love makes our shortcomings okay
does a great injustice to that love. For
if we loved Christ we would want to
become better, if only for Christ's
sake.
What Christianity teaches us is
that despite having every reason to be
complacent, we absolutely shouldn't.
Happy Easter.
