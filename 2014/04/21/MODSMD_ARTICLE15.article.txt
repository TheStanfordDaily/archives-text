# Do you actually want to help me?: On Palestinian, Black and Queer Liberation

uri olonialism is not about
I bad people being mean to
V_y others ("bad" Israelis
don't steal queer Palestinians' lunch
money)," queer Palestinian activist
Ghaith Hilal writes. "Being super
'good' doesn't magically dissolve
systems of oppression." Ghaith's
words, which come from the must
read article "Eight Things Palestin
ian Queers Are Tired of Hearing,"
articulate my own view as I come to
reflect on student organizing
around Palestine and broader is
sues of justice and liberation.
Two weeks ago, Stanford Israel
Alliance co-hosted a screening of
"Out in the Dark" with the Queer
Straight Alliance. Having watched
the film and its portrayal of a star
crossed relationship between a gay
Palestinian resident of the West
Bank and a gay Jewish Israeli and
having spent a month in the West
Bank primarily with queer Pales
tinians, the film felt both compelling
(I'm a sucker for most love stories)
and violent. What was compelling
was the simple human desire to love
and be loved, and watching a couple
attempt to fight the structural bar
riers conspiring against them
the violence, moreover, laid in the
overlying and underlying messages

that come across during these mo
ments of vulnerability and emotion
al attachment to the film.
"Out in the Dark" portrays Roy,
a well-off, Jewish Israeli lawyer as a
savior to Nimr, a queer Palestinian
student who apparently must flee
from his repressive, homophobic so
ciety across the apartheid wall in Ra
mallah. While the film does show
parts of the oppressive nature of the
Israeli Occupation Force, it casts
every Arab male character besides
Nimr as homophobic and violent or
effeminate and non-threatening,
playing into stereotypes about
Palestinian/Arab men and gay men
without delving into the complexity
of resisting colonization and occupa
tion or of finding balance around be
ing Palestinian, religious and gay.
Glimmers of statements against the
occupation highlight a corrupt Is
raeli security apparatus without
challenging the underlying problem
(settler colonialism and its effects on
the indigenous population). Roy's
parents' aversion to his sexual orien
tation and his Palestinian boyfriend
do not cast Israeli society as homo
phobic or racist, but as relatively
reasonable responses within a com
plex society.
So Palestinian society is one-di
mensional and bad; Israeli society is
complicated, nuanced, has its prob
lems, but ultimately better. It is a
hop-skip-and-a-jump from here to
the association that Palestinian soci
ety is backwards, uncivilized and
therefore deserving of its occupied
status or that Israeli society is
relatively progressive and therefore
justified in its ongoing colonization
and occupation of "backwards
Arabs."
For people coming to this film
with only vague context to the issue
of Israel and Palestine, these may be
non-issues or not obvious issues.
But the Israeli government admit
tedly spends millions of dollars on its
Brand Israel campaign to portray
the state as progressive, including
"pinkwashing" or marketing Israel
as a haven to gays all around the
world while ignoring its 47-year oc
cupation of Palestine and the oppres
sion it brings to Palestinians regard
less of their sexual orientation. "Out
in the Dark" might be seen as a soft
er form of pinkwashing not one

that extols Israeli society, but one
that portrays Palestinian society as
qualitatively worse and ignores the
amplifying effect of military occupa
tion on oppression that exists in
every society. This type of campaign
is not original by any means.
During Jim Crow and the Cold
War, the CIA sent black performers
like Louis Armstrong and other
artists to perform abroad to weaken
foreign judgment of America's racist
policies. The South African govern
ment sponsored an eerily similar
Brand South Africa propaganda
campaign during apartheid. In the
cases of the U.S., South Africa and
Israel, artists critical of the coun
try's policies have either had their
passports revoked or did not receive
state funding to travel. The colonizer,
the former master, the ruling party
has the privilege of defining his own
narrative and the resources to limit
the narratives of the colonized, the
former slave, the ruled over.
Until the occupation is over and
Palestinians have the resources and
access to shape and share their own
narratives, films like "Out in the
Dark" remain at best naive and at
worst a cynical exploitation of the
marginalized parties they seek to
bring attention to.
I hope that viewers of the film
could take the sympathy that the
film's protagonist very much de
serves and extend it to its proper
end: If we care about the wellbeing
of Nimr, a queer Palestinian, we
presumably care about the wellbe
ing of queer Palestinians generally,
no? For the majority of us that do,
what does caring for this group
mean? Maybe we should ask them!
"Palestinians are living under a
decades-long military occupation,"
writes Ghaith Hilal, a founding
member of A1 Qaws for Sexual &
Gender Diversity in Palestinian So
ciety. "The occupation amplifies the
diverse forms of oppression that are
experienced in every society."
"These films strip the voice and
agency of Palestinian queers, por
traying them as victims that need
saving from their own society,"
Ghaith continues. "If you want to
learn about the reality of our com
munity and our struggle, try listen
ing to what queer Palestinians have
to say, at the Al-Qaws or Palestinian
Queers for BDS websites ... You
cannot have queer liberation while
apartheid, patriarchy, capitalism
and other oppressions exist. It's im
portant to target the connections of
these oppressive forces."
As someone who also exists at
the intersection of two marginal
ized identities being black and
queer I can resonate pretty well
with a lot of the sentiments activists
in al-Qaws raise. While many
Americans have the perception of
the black community as being ho
mophobic, I do not identify my pri
mary struggle as fighting heteropa
triarchal tendencies that some
times arise in our community.
(These tendencies exist in the larg
er American society as well, yet we
fixate on the black community be
cause it is an easy 'Other' to identi
fy.) I identify my primary struggle

as fighting the structural racism
that continues to oppress our com
munity as a whole.
While the stresses of systemic
injustice may amplify these tenden
cies within the black community, of
ten we attribute them to the inferi
ority or less civilized nature of
black culture, implicitly justifying
the community's continued margin
alized and exploited social position.
If you really want to be an ally to
me, join anti-racist work the
fight to end mass incarceration and
police brutality, the struggle for
economic justice, insist that black
people are people. Let me and oth
er black queers handle our internal
struggle in the way that we see fit.
If we need help, we will ask for it.
Chances are, though, that what we
ask for might not fit so well with the
larger society.
In the same way, we should re
sist attempts of the Israeli propa
ganda machine to provide the nar
rative for any Palestinians queer
or otherwise.

as a haven to gays all around the
world while ignoring its 47-year oc
cupation of Palestine and the oppres
sion it brings to Palestinians regard
less of their sexual orientation. "Out
in the Dark" might be seen as a soft
er form of pinkwashing not one

that extols Israeli society, but one
that portrays Palestinian society as
qualitatively worse and ignores the
amplifying effect of military occupa
tion on oppression that exists in
every society. This type of campaign
is not original by any means.
During Jim Crow and the Cold
War, the CIA sent black performers
like Louis Armstrong and other
artists to perform abroad to weaken
foreign judgment of America's racist
policies. The South African govern
ment sponsored an eerily similar
Brand South Africa propaganda
campaign during apartheid. In the
cases of the U.S., South Africa and
Israel, artists critical of the coun
try's policies have either had their
passports revoked or did not receive
state funding to travel. The colonizer,
the former master, the ruling party
has the privilege of defining his own
narrative and the resources to limit
the narratives of the colonized, the
former slave, the ruled over.
Until the occupation is over and
Palestinians have the resources and
access to shape and share their own
narratives, films like "Out in the
Dark" remain at best naive and at
worst a cynical exploitation of the
marginalized parties they seek to
bring attention to.
I hope that viewers of the film
could take the sympathy that the
film's protagonist very much de
serves and extend it to its proper
end: If we care about the wellbeing
of Nimr, a queer Palestinian, we
presumably care about the wellbe
ing of queer Palestinians generally,
no? For the majority of us that do,
what does caring for this group
mean? Maybe we should ask them!
"Palestinians are living under a
decades-long military occupation,"
writes Ghaith Hilal, a founding
member of A1 Qaws for Sexual &
Gender Diversity in Palestinian So
ciety. "The occupation amplifies the
diverse forms of oppression that are
experienced in every society."
"These films strip the voice and
agency of Palestinian queers, por
traying them as victims that need
saving from their own society,"
Ghaith continues. "If you want to
learn about the reality of our com
munity and our struggle, try listen
ing to what queer Palestinians have
to say, at the Al-Qaws or Palestinian
Queers for BDS websites ... You
cannot have queer liberation while
apartheid, patriarchy, capitalism
and other oppressions exist. It's im
portant to target the connections of
these oppressive forces."
As someone who also exists at
the intersection of two marginal
ized identities being black and
queer I can resonate pretty well
with a lot of the sentiments activists
in al-Qaws raise. While many
Americans have the perception of
the black community as being ho
mophobic, I do not identify my pri
mary struggle as fighting heteropa
triarchal tendencies that some
times arise in our community.
(These tendencies exist in the larg
er American society as well, yet we
fixate on the black community be
cause it is an easy 'Other' to identi
fy.) I identify my primary struggle

as fighting the structural racism
that continues to oppress our com
munity as a whole.
While the stresses of systemic
injustice may amplify these tenden
cies within the black community, of
ten we attribute them to the inferi
ority or less civilized nature of
black culture, implicitly justifying
the community's continued margin
alized and exploited social position.
If you really want to be an ally to
me, join anti-racist work the
fight to end mass incarceration and
police brutality, the struggle for
economic justice, insist that black
people are people. Let me and oth
er black queers handle our internal
struggle in the way that we see fit.
If we need help, we will ask for it.
Chances are, though, that what we
ask for might not fit so well with the
larger society.
In the same way, we should re
sist attempts of the Israeli propa
ganda machine to provide the nar
rative for any Palestinians queer
or otherwise.

Two weeks ago, Stanford Israel
Alliance co-hosted a screening of
"Out in the Dark" with the Queer
Straight Alliance. Having watched
the film and its portrayal of a star
crossed relationship between a gay
Palestinian resident of the West
Bank and a gay Jewish Israeli and
having spent a month in the West
Bank primarily with queer Pales
tinians, the film felt both compelling
(I'm a sucker for most love stories)
and violent. What was compelling
was the simple human desire to love
and be loved, and watching a couple
attempt to fight the structural bar
riers conspiring against them
the violence, moreover, laid in the
overlying and underlying messages

that come across during these mo
ments of vulnerability and emotion
al attachment to the film.
"Out in the Dark" portrays Roy,
a well-off, Jewish Israeli lawyer as a
savior to Nimr, a queer Palestinian
student who apparently must flee
from his repressive, homophobic so
ciety across the apartheid wall in Ra
mallah. While the film does show
parts of the oppressive nature of the
Israeli Occupation Force, it casts
every Arab male character besides
Nimr as homophobic and violent or
effeminate and non-threatening,
playing into stereotypes about
Palestinian/Arab men and gay men
without delving into the complexity
of resisting colonization and occupa
tion or of finding balance around be
ing Palestinian, religious and gay.
Glimmers of statements against the
occupation highlight a corrupt Is
raeli security apparatus without
challenging the underlying problem
(settler colonialism and its effects on
the indigenous population). Roy's
parents' aversion to his sexual orien
tation and his Palestinian boyfriend
do not cast Israeli society as homo
phobic or racist, but as relatively
reasonable responses within a com
plex society.
So Palestinian society is one-di
mensional and bad; Israeli society is
complicated, nuanced, has its prob
lems, but ultimately better. It is a
hop-skip-and-a-jump from here to
the association that Palestinian soci
ety is backwards, uncivilized and
therefore deserving of its occupied
status or that Israeli society is
relatively progressive and therefore
justified in its ongoing colonization
and occupation of "backwards
Arabs."
For people coming to this film
with only vague context to the issue
of Israel and Palestine, these may be
non-issues or not obvious issues.
But the Israeli government admit
tedly spends millions of dollars on its
Brand Israel campaign to portray
the state as progressive, including
"pinkwashing" or marketing Israel
as a haven to gays all around the
world while ignoring its 47-year oc
cupation of Palestine and the oppres
sion it brings to Palestinians regard
less of their sexual orientation. "Out
