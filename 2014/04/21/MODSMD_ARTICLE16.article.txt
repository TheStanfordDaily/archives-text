# Weekend marked by Big Slam upsets
## Women fall to Cal, men prevail 
### FIONA NOONAN STAFF WRITER 
For the Cal men's tennis team
and the Stanford women's tennis
team, Senior Day did not go as ex
pected, according to rankings at
least. In a day of Big Slam upsets,
the No. 37 Stanford men's team
(14-4, 5-2 Pac-12) took down No. 19
Cal (14-6, 4-3 Pac-12) in Berkeley,
and the No. 5 Stanford women (16-
2, 8-2 Pac-12) fell 6-1 to the No. 10
Bears (18-4, 10-0 Pac-12) in a stun
ning loss at home.

The burgeoning men's squad
rode a four-match winning streak
into Saturday, where they defeated
the Bears 4-2 as Cal celebrated its
two senior players, Ben McLachlan
and Campbell Johnson.
When the two teams last met in
February, Cal smashed the Cardinal
7-0 at Stanford, but past results did
not help the Bears this weekend.
After dropping the doubles point
with losses on courts one and three,
the Cardinal came raging back be
hind sophomore Nolan Paige on
court four. Paige, who suffered
from illness throughout winter
quarter, has only been back in the
lineup since the April 5 match
against UCLA, and has steadily im
proved his singles game since his
return.
Cal's Flip Bergevi briefly re
gained the lead for the Bears after
beating Stanford sophomore Trey
Strobel in three sets, but the mo
mentum did not last long.
Stanford's own senior Daniel Ho
delivered the first heavy blow to a
perfect Senior Day by taking down
Johnson 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 on court two
before Stanford sophomore Robert
Stineman won on court six in three
sets.
To cap it off, junior John Morris
sey, who has been hot all season,
clinched the match on the first
court. In a rematch from February,
he faced Cal's only ranked singles
player, No. 56 McLachlan, but this
time Morrissey came out on top
with a 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory to spoil
McLachlan's final regular-season
home match of his career.
The win puts the Cardinal at
No. 3 in the Pac-12 going into the
postseason and will certainly cata
pult them up the national rankings
once again. Stanford has defied ex
pectations all season, with their on
ly losses coming at the hands of
top-10 teams.
For the Stanford women, Satur
day did not go nearly as well. Cal
came to Taube Family Tennis Cen
ter, where seniors Kristie Ahn and
Amelia Herring were honored in a
ceremony before the match in front
of an unusually large crowd. In
their four years on the Farm, Stan
ford women's tennis has an 87-9
overall record and has won two

Pac-12 titles and one national
championship.
Of the team's nine losses experi
enced by the seniors, none had ever
been at home to Cal until Saturday.
Earlier this season, the Cardinal
defeated the Bears 5-2 in a non
conference match, but the tables
were turned as Stanford suffered
its worst loss of the season and Cal
became the Pac-12 champions with
a perfect 10-0 record.
The day started with three in
credibly competitive doubles
matches; after the duo of sopho
more Krista Hardebeck and fresh
man Caroline Doyle dropped their
match 8-3, it looked like the doubles
point was still within reach for the
Cardinal. The No. 9-ranked duo of
freshman Carol Zhao and Ahn got
to set point at 6-7 to tie it up, but
Cal came back to take the match,
forcing freshman Taylor Davidson
and junior Ellen Tsay to abandon
their match just as they reached
match point at 7-4.
No. 4 Ahn, playing with a taped
right forearm and right ankle,
bounced back immediately for a 6-
3, 6-2 win against Cal's No. 32
Denise Starr on court one, but it
turned out to be Stanford's lone
point of the day.
Ultimately, the dual came down
to finishing out matches, and Stan
ford struggled. Even the usually
perfect Zhao, who had not lost in 17
matches, had a tough day and was
visibly shaken by the rare doubles
loss.
"We had four first-set wins, and
we had our chances," said women's
head coach Lele Forood. "I think
especially we couldn't just put our
foot down in those second sets
enough, and they made nice come
backs and really played well."
Once Cal's No. 67 Maegan
Manesse clinched the match
against No. 39 Doyle on court six,
Stanford's hopes for a piece of the
Pac-12 title (which they would have
shared with No. 2 UCLA) were
dashed. By the time No. 44 Krista
Hardebeck fell in the final match on
court six, the Bears could be heard
chanting and celebrating on the
court.
Despite the disappointment of
losing the final match of the season,
the day still held many positives,
especially for Ahn, who now has a
career record of 94-15.
"[Playing Cal today] was awe
some," Ahn said after the match. "I
love playing for the big moments,
and I don't think we really could
have set a bigger stage than this."
For now, the Cardinal must fo
cus on the Pac-12 Tournament, in
Ojai, Calif., and beyond to the na
tional tournament, where they
could very well face UCLA or Cal
again.
"They [Cal] were very good to
day," Forood said. "They deserved
to win, they deserve the conference
title with their wins over the LA
schools a couple weekends ago, and
they're a good team. Going to be
right there in the postseason, too."
The men's Pac-12 Tournament
begins on April 23 and the women's
starts on April 24 in Ojai, Calif.
