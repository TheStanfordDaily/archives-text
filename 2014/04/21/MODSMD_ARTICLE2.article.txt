# Hope House engages recovering addicts

### IRENE HSU DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Ursula K. Le Guin's short story,
"The Ones Who Walk Away From
Omelas," is about a Utopian commu
nity whose happiness depends on
the suffering of one child. Every
year, the community is informed of
the child and every year, while

the rest of the community is able to
come to terms with the atrocity,
some members leave the utopia.
When the story is taught at
Stanford, undergraduate students
often discuss the community's per
spectives and what it means to walk
away from the community. When
the story is taught 15 minutes away
at Hope House, a residential sub

stance abuse treatment program
for women, the women consistently
discuss the opposite perspective
what it is like to suffer for the sake
of others. It is a twist in conversa
tion and interpretation that the co
founder of Hope House Scholars
Program, Professor of Philosophy
Debra Satz, never anticipated be
fore teaching the program.

Hope House was founded in
1990 by Executive Director Karen
Francone. In 2001, Francone
worked with Satz, also a director of
the Center for Ethics in Society
and Rob Reich M.A.'9B Ph.D. '9B,
Hope House Scholars Program co
founder and faculty director of the
Program on Ethics in Society.
Three years ago, Satz and Reich

received the 2010 Miriam Aaron
Roland Volunteer Service Prize
from the Haas Center for Public
Service for the program.
