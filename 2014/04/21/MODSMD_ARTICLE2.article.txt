# Hope House engages recovering addicts
## 
### IRENE HSU DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Ursula K. Le Guin's short story,
"The Ones Who Walk Away From
Omelas," is about a Utopian commu
nity whose happiness depends on
the suffering of one child. Every
year, the community is informed of
the child and every year, while

the rest of the community is able to
come to terms with the atrocity,
some members leave the utopia.
When the story is taught at
Stanford, undergraduate students
often discuss the community's per
spectives and what it means to walk
away from the community. When
the story is taught 15 minutes away
at Hope House, a residential sub

stance abuse treatment program
for women, the women consistently
discuss the opposite perspective
what it is like to suffer for the sake
of others. It is a twist in conversa
tion and interpretation that the co
founder of Hope House Scholars
Program, Professor of Philosophy
Debra Satz, never anticipated be
fore teaching the program.

Hope House was founded in
1990 by Executive Director Karen
Francone. In 2001, Francone
worked with Satz, also a director of
the Center for Ethics in Society
and Rob Reich M.A.'9B Ph.D. '9B,
Hope House Scholars Program co
founder and faculty director of the
Program on Ethics in Society.
Three years ago, Satz and Reich

received the 2010 Miriam Aaron
Roland Volunteer Service Prize
from the Haas Center for Public
Service for the program.
"Stanford students are diverse,
but these women [at Hope House]
can relate Plato and Aristotle to life
experiences that are outside of the
range of almost all Stanford
undergraduates," Satz, who
has taught "Philosophy and
Social Justice" with Reich
several times since 2001 at
Hope House, said.
Every Monday, two pro
fessors co-teach a class in
the humanities at the house
in Redwood City. On Fri
days, undergraduate and
graduate students tutor the
women in the class material
and in then- writing. Classes
taught previously include
"Humor in Music," which is
also an introductory seminar
on campus, and "The Dinner
Party: Exploring Women's
History through Women's
Art."
Since 2011, graduate stu

dents have volunteered to
teach during the summer, al
lowing the program to run
yearlong instead of only dur
ing the academic year.
After the women com
plete the Scholars Program,
they receive two units of
credit from Stanford Contin
uing Studies and a voucher
for another Continuing
Studies course.
"The scholars program
has become part of the cul
ture at the Hope house "
Francone said. "It helps the
women broaden their minds
and know that there is a lot
more out there to learn
about life."
While Stanford and Hope
House said the program has
met all expectations struc
turally, Satz and Berry ex
pressed hope that the pro
gram will receive more fund
ing either directly from the
University or from other or

ganizations on campus.
Satz's vision for the
Scholars Program includes
expanding the program be
yond Hope House. She
added that she hopes to keep
in contact with the women
and further reconnect them
with education after they
have left Hope House, which
is currently a 180-day pro
gram.
Both parts of Satz's vi
sion require more funding
and faculty than the pro
gram currently has.
The program currently
runs on little funding, in part
because all the members
working for the program, in
cluding the professors and
students, are volunteers, ac
cording to Ethics in Soci
ety's executive director Joan
Berry.
"I've been doing this for
10 years, and it's amazing
how few tutors I cycle

through and it's because
so many tutors stay for mul
tiple quarters," Berry said.
When the Scholars Pro
gram first began in 2001, the
women of Hope House were
initially resistant to the con
cept.
"They were rebellious
and wondered why they
needed to take a university
program," Francone said.
"But at Hope House we
aren't just dealing with ad
diction we're dealing
with them as a whole per
son. Taking a course and not
knowing if you can do it is
like going through recovery
you have to trust the
process and trust you can do
it, one step at a time. If you
take that leap of faith, you
may end up leading a very
different life."
