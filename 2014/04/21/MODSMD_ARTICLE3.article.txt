## Mock talks transgender identity 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
On April 18, more than one hundred peo
ple gathered outside the Black Community
Services Center to hear Janet Mock The
New York Times best-selling author of the
memoir "Redefining Realness: My Path to
Womanhood, Identity, Love & So Much
More" speak about what it means to be
transgender.
According to Mock, her book was prima
rily influenced by Maya Angelou's "When

the Caged Bird Sings," which discusses is
sues like sexual abuse.
"This idea of realness is a sense of sur
vival as you are already a person of color
and then you add the trans part," Mock
said.
Mock explained that she did not write
the memoir for herself and did not intend
the book to be something as simplistic as a
voice of the voiceless.
"I wanted my target audience to be
younger girls to give them language and
let them know they're not alone," Mock

said. "My goal wasn't to educate, but by cen
tering that young, poor trans girl of color,
we centralize everyone else ... Everyone
else can choose to understand."
As she was developing her female identi
ty, one of Mock's role models was Beyonce
Knowles. For Mock, Beyonce was a form of
validation "the epitome of a graceful,
strong, beautiful woman." Mock's anecdote
about her mother showing support of Bey
once by going to the grocery store and pick-

ing up magazines with Beyon
ce on the cover even elicited
laughter from the audience.
Mock said that she made
her pivotal decision to em
bark on her journey to wom
anhood towards the start of
the millennium.
"With the limited time I
had left, I wanted to be fully
me," Mock said. "I had this in
ternal angst about my body. I
made a decision to engage in
the sex trade full time to af
ford the medical things I
would need."
Mock said that she felt a
sense of responsibility to be
come an advocate for change
as a member of the transgen
der community. With her edu
cation, training, appearance
and articulation, she was able
to work closely with a pub
lisher to use her memoir as a
way to emerge from sur
vivor's guilt.
Mock experienced racism
and classism after leaving
Honolulu, her childhood
home, for New York Universi
ty, and Stanford students in
the audience said that her sto

lies resonated with them.
After seeing her speak at
Stanford in spring of 2013 for
the first time, Kevin Roberts
'l3, president of Black and
Queer at Stanford, expressed
enthusiasm about having
Mock back as a speaker again
this year.
"She's a great person to
bring because she inhabits
her identity in away that I
think many queer people of
color have learned to prior to
Stanford but may not yet
have it sutured in this very
privileged, very white su
premacist space," Roberts
said.
According to Violet Tra
chtenberg 'l6, president of
SSQL, then- organization in
vited Mock as a keynote
speaker in last spring and re
ceived a strong, positive reac
tion from students. Trachten
berg described this year's
turnout as even more inspir
ing.
"For me, what's most em
powering is seeing Black

House fill up with people who
want to come see a poor,
mixed, black indigenous trans
woman who is proud about all
of these things," Trachten
berg said.
Audience member Keagan
Sitompul 'l7 shared his admi
ration for Mock.
"Janet Mock carried the
room with the grace of some
body who has come out of her
journey through womanhood
a strong and powerful
woman," Sitompul said. "She
was accessible but subtle,
cheeky but never crass. She
was everything."

voice of the voiceless.
"I wanted my target audience to be
younger girls to give them language and
let them know they're not alone," Mock

said. "My goal wasn't to educate, but by cen
tering that young, poor trans girl of color,
we centralize everyone else ... Everyone
else can choose to understand."
As she was developing her female identi
ty, one of Mock's role models was Beyonce
Knowles. For Mock, Beyonce was a form of
validation "the epitome of a graceful,
strong, beautiful woman." Mock's anecdote

Last Friday at the Black Community Services Center, Janet Mock, the New York Times best-selling author of the memoir
"Redefining Realness," discussed transgender identity. Mock was well-received by more than one hundred attendees at the talk.
ing up magazines with Beyon
ce on the cover even elicited
laughter from the audience.
Mock said that she made
her pivotal decision to em
bark on her journey to wom
anhood towards the start of
the millennium.
"With the limited time I
had left, I wanted to be fully
me," Mock said. "I had this in
ternal angst about my body. I
made a decision to engage in
the sex trade full time to af
ford the medical things I
would need."
Mock said that she felt a
sense of responsibility to be
come an advocate for change
as a member of the transgen
der community. With her edu
cation, training, appearance
and articulation, she was able
to work closely with a pub
lisher to use her memoir as a
way to emerge from sur
vivor's guilt.
Mock experienced racism
and classism after leaving
Honolulu, her childhood
home, for New York Universi
ty, and Stanford students in
the audience said that her sto

lies resonated with them.
After seeing her speak at
Stanford in spring of 2013 for
the first time, Kevin Roberts
'l3, president of Black and
Queer at Stanford, expressed
enthusiasm about having
Mock back as a speaker again
this year.
"She's a great person to
bring because she inhabits
her identity in away that I
think many queer people of
color have learned to prior to
Stanford but may not yet
have it sutured in this very
privileged, very white su
premacist space," Roberts
said.
According to Violet Tra
chtenberg 'l6, president of
SSQL, then- organization in
vited Mock as a keynote
speaker in last spring and re
ceived a strong, positive reac
tion from students. Trachten
berg described this year's
turnout as even more inspir
ing.
"For me, what's most em
powering is seeing Black

House fill up with people who
want to come see a poor,
mixed, black indigenous trans
woman who is proud about all
of these things," Trachten
berg said.
Audience member Keagan
Sitompul 'l7 shared his admi
ration for Mock.
"Janet Mock carried the
room with the grace of some
body who has come out of her
journey through womanhood
a strong and powerful
woman," Sitompul said. "She
was accessible but subtle,
cheeky but never crass. She
was everything."
