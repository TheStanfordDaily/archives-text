# NEWS BRIEF
## Stanford team wins second place at LAHacks 
### – Catherine Zaw 
Last weekend at the inaugural LAHacks
hackathon, a team of Stanford undergraduates
Jason Teplitz 'l7, Jay Moon 'l7, Dennis
Jeong 'l7, Mike Precup 'l7 and Russell Kaplan
'l7—won second place for their hack, called
Wormhole.
The team won $l,OOO for their hack, as well
as a drone that was provided by one of the tech
nology sponsors of LAHacks.
"The idea [behind Wormhole] is to basically
allow you to use any computer as your own,"
Teplitz said. "So you could go log in to your ac
count and see what you've been working on and
what computer you were working on so any
Word document you were working on or any
Google Chrome tabs you had opened, you can
access them."
According to Teplitz, the original idea was
conceived at an earlier event. Teplitz had envi
sioned a "disconnect from hardware," where
users would no longer need to be attached to a
physical computer or laptop in order to access
their work.
Moon framed the team's success during the
36-hour hack as partially a reflection of skills
the team members had already learnt.
"We worked on things that we were good
at," Moon said. 'At [a previous
hackathon], we worked on a
3D tower defense game, which
was challenge because we
have never used Oculus or

Kinect and have never made a
3D game before. At LAHacks,
we were all doing what we do
best."
Team members noted the
value, however, of expanding
their skill sets through the
hackathon.
"One interesting thing at
hackathons is the balance be
tween how much you're learn

ing new stuff versus how much
you're doing what you're good
at and excelling at that," Ka
plan said. "Some people will
explore a completely new
technology but you can also go
into a hackathon and do stuff
that you're good at to be pro
ductive."
