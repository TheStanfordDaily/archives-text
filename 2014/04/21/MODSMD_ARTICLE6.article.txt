## Researchers refine cancer drug delivery

A team of Stanford researchers has identi
fied a more efficient means of delivering
nanoparticle cancer drugs to afflicted cells,
opening the door to an original method of can
cer therapy.
The research team which was led by
Professor of Radiology Sanjiv Gambhir had
sought to look into whether or not the immune
system could become a Trojan horse for more
efficient nanoparticle cancer drug delivery.
"Certain kinds of immune cells are gob
bling up nanoparticles and taking them to tu
mor site," Gambhir explained.
Given their potential for precise targeting
and active cellular uptake, nanoparticles have
emerged as a promising class of cancer thera
peutics. The human body's unique treatment
of such small particles nanoparticles range
from one to a few hundred nanometers in
size may also enhance the delivery of nanopar
ticles into the tumor bed
"The nanoparticle itself is very simple,"
Gambhir said. "It is just carbon atoms rolled
up in a cylinder.
Senior research scientist Bryan Smith ex
plained that the team had injected the
nanoparticles into living mice with tumors in
order to visualize the nanoparticles' behavior.
Although researchers had expected the
nanoparticles to find the tumor on their own,
they found that many of the nanoparticles rap
idly entered circulating cells in the blood
stream.
"The nanoparticles were taken up with un
precedented selectivity by a single subset of
monocytes," Smith recalled.
The team also found that monocytes, an im
mune cell for fueling many diseases including
cancer, ferried the nanoparticles into the tu
mor like a Trojan horse.
Gambhir emphasized that the research was
only possible with state-of-the-art imaging,
which allowed them to watch the immune cells
and nanoparticles moving in a living animal.
"Once you can visualize what is going on at
the cellular level, then you can start to unmask
things," Gambhir said. "Imaging is powerful
