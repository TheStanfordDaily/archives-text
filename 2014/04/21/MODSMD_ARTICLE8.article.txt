## MLB contracts not indicative of talent 
### Michael Peterson 
Last week, ESPN re
leased a list of the 25
highest-paid athletes in
the world. Out of the 25
highest-paid athletes, 10
were baseball players.
This fact wasn't surprising, as
baseball continues to hand out some
of the biggest contracts in the world.
However, in examining the produc
tion of the baseball players on the
list, the dearth of excellence was
striking.
Most of the athletes who made
the list and are not baseball players
continue to dominate their respective
sports. The top four highest-paid ath
letes â€” Floyd Mayweather Jr., Li
onel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and
Aaron Rodgers are all decorated
with titles and awards. It's hard to
find one in the top 25 that doesn't
produce at the highest of levels
maybe other than Matthew Stafford
and Matt Ryan.
But when looking at the baseball
players, it's a whole different story.
Out of the 10 baseball players who
made the list, only four were All-
Stars in 2013 Robinson Cano,
Prince Fielder, Joe Mauer and Cliff
Lee.
When you average the statistics
of the four pitchers on the list (Lee,
Zack Greinke, Cole Hamels and CC
Sabathia) in 2013, you get a solid 51-
39 record and a 3.50 ERA. While
these are definitely respectable num
bers, they're certainly not numbers
you would expect from the four high
est-paid pitchers, considering that
the 2013 league ERA was 3.86.
The numbers for the highest-paid
hitters tell a similar tale. If you aver
age the statistics for the six hitters on
the list (Mauer, Cano, Fielder, Albert
Pujols, Ryan Howard and Mark Teix
eira) for the last season in which they
had more than 250 at-bats, you get a
batting average of .285 with 19 home
runs, 75 RBIs and 62 runs scored. In
comparison, the Detroit Tigers hit
.283 as a team last season. It's easy to
make an argument that only one of
the 10 highest-paid baseball players
(Cano) is actually among the top 10
players in baseball.
The question arises, why does
baseball have such moderately
above-average production from what
should be the cream of its crop?
The simplest answer has to stem
from the exorbitant contracts that
are handed out to players already
past their primes. For a sport that
generally sees players peak between
ages 25-29, the average age of the 10
highest-paid players is 32.1. Fielder,
Pujols, Greinke, Mauer, Cano and
Hamels all have at least five years re
maining on their contracts including
this season that will keep them
among the highest-paid players until
they are anywhere from ages 35 to
42.
The bloated contracts result
largely from the after-effects of the
steroid era. In the early 2000s, it be
came common to see an older player
still produce at a high level. Barry
Bonds hit his record 73 home runs at
age 36, Mark McGwire hit 65 home
runs at age 35 and Sammy Sosa hit
40 home runs at age 34. However,
these players were the exception and
have all been connected to steroid
use in one way or another.
Even a decade later, some teams
still think that players can play the
same at age 35 as they did at 25. As
we have seen with the quick decline
of guys like Pujols, Fielder, Howard
and Teixeira, this is not the case. But
the Angels signed Pujols to play until
he's 41 years old. The Tigers just
signed Miguel Cabrera to play until
he's 39.
The lack of contract limits and
safeguards continues to hurt the
MLB. There is no way that Pujols
should make 30 million dollars at age
41 and the Angels know that now, but
what can they do about it? Nothing.
The NFL only guarantees some
of the money in most contracts and
has a salary cap. The NBA limits the
length and size of contracts. Each of
these leagues, at least partially, al
lows the team some protection
against potential contracts gone
wrong. It's becoming ridiculous that
severely underwhelming players can
be signed for many years into the fu
ture and the MLB is the prime ex
ample.
Players should certainly reap the
reward for the hard work they put in
and the draw they bring to the
league. They need guaranteed mon
ey in order to guard against risk of
injury and provide incentives to work

hard. However, I'm finding it more
and more difficult to accept the fact
that baseball teams choose to offer
ludicrous contracts and then suffer
the consequences on their payrolls
for years to come.
The Angels and other high
spending teams have made risky de
cisions that, looking back, should
never have been made. Teams only
have themselves to blame for these

weighty contracts.
With the way the league is trend
ing though, the bloated contract
problem is only expanding. The
MLB may want to consider a new
contract structure that will guard
teams against these contracts, like
the NFL and NBA.

Michael Peterson is currently re
questing a 10-year, $350 million
contract with The Daily that would
make him the highest-paid colum
nist in professional sports. Tell
him to think more realistically at

him @mpetes93.
