# MARATHON WIN
## CARD EXTEND WIN STREAK TO 12 GAMES 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 3 Stanford men's volleyball
team defeated No. 6 UC-Irvine in a
thrilling five-set match at Maples Pavil
ion, winning their first match of the
MPSF Tournament (28-30,25-22,25-15,
17-25, 15-13). The Cardinal extended
their winning streak to 12 straight
matches and will travel to Utah this
Thursday to face No. 2 seed Pepperdine
in the semifinals.

Saturday's match was high intensity
from the beginning, with both teams
clearly ready to battle to keep their
MPSF Championship title hopes alive
with a spot in the semifinals. But while
both the Anteaters and the Cardinal
played impressively and demonstrated
why they are top teams in the country,
it was Stanford's confident poise, home
court advantage and ability to capitalize
off UCl's errors that ultimately won the
match for them.
The Cardinal are currently one of
the most dominant teams in the MPSF
and lately have seemed truly invincible.
When discussing the winning streak,
head coach John Kosty said the team
has "been doing it with patience and
confidence." The 12-match winning
streak is the second-longest for the
Cardinal in program history, with the
longest being a 16-match streak during
the 1996 season.
Stanford started the match strong
with an ace from senior outside hitter
Eric Mochalski, putting the Cardinal up
4-1 in the first set. But UCI made it
clear early on that it would not be de
feated easily. The first set was relative
ly even as it was at one point tied at nine
