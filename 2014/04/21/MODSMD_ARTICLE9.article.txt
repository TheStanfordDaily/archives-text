# MARATHON WIN
## CARD EXTEND WIN STREAK TO 12 GAMES 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 3 Stanford men's volleyball
team defeated No. 6 UC-Irvine in a
thrilling five-set match at Maples Pavil
ion, winning their first match of the
MPSF Tournament (28-30,25-22,25-15,
17-25, 15-13). The Cardinal extended
their winning streak to 12 straight
matches and will travel to Utah this
Thursday to face No. 2 seed Pepperdine
in the semifinals.

Saturday's match was high intensity
from the beginning, with both teams
clearly ready to battle to keep their
MPSF Championship title hopes alive
with a spot in the semifinals. But while
both the Anteaters and the Cardinal
played impressively and demonstrated
why they are top teams in the country,
it was Stanford's confident poise, home
court advantage and ability to capitalize
off UCl's errors that ultimately won the
match for them.
The Cardinal are currently one of
the most dominant teams in the MPSF
and lately have seemed truly invincible.
When discussing the winning streak,
head coach John Kosty said the team
has "been doing it with patience and
confidence." The 12-match winning
streak is the second-longest for the
Cardinal in program history, with the
longest being a 16-match streak during
the 1996 season.
Stanford started the match strong
with an ace from senior outside hitter
Eric Mochalski, putting the Cardinal up
4-1 in the first set. But UCI made it
clear early on that it would not be de
feated easily. The first set was relative
ly even as it was at one point tied at nine

and again at 11, with both teams
hitting above.6oo and serving ex
ceptionally well.
UCI soon took the lead and was
winning 21-18 before Stanford cut
the lead to 23-22, forcing an
Anteaters timeout. Stanford tied
the match at 23-23 with a kill from
senior Brian Cook and capitalized
off of an attack error by the
Anteaters to go up 25-24. The next
few points were back and forth with
neither team wanting to give up the
first set. However, Stanford was the
first to blink and UCI won the first
set 30-28.
In the second set, Stanford once
again was hitting .600 and took the
lead early on. Stanford increased its
energy, playing with intensity and
aggressive offense that allowed
them to maintain the lead through
out the second set. While UCI cut
the lead to 19-18, Stanford won the
set 25-22 and tied the match at one
set apiece.
The third set was the most im
pressive for Stanford's defense,

with an especially impressive block
ing performance. Sophomore Con
rad Kaminski had three straight
blocks to put the Cardinal up 15-6
and then followed the blocks with a
kill to put the Cardinal up 19-8.
Stanford dominated the third set
while the Anteaters began to look a
little overwhelmed.
UCI pulled it together in the
fourth set to rally and tie the match
at two sets each. While Stanford
was able to get within five points
during the fourth set, the Anteaters
won by eight points at 25-17.
The whole match, but especially
the final set, was a true nail-biter.
UCI went ahead early but the Car
dinal tied it at 7-7. Irvin then had
two critical kills to put the Cardinal
ahead at 11-9. When the Anteaters
took the lead at 13-12 and Stanford
found itself in dangerous territory,
however, Maples seemed incredibly
on edge and both teams seemed
nervous but confident.
It was Stanford's consistent and
impressive service game that gave
them the final advantage, to rally
the team from behind and produce
the last critical points of the match.
Senior Scott Sakaida, a serving spe
cialist, served the last three points
of the match, creating the opportu

nity for Stanford to control the last
three points in order to get the best
attacks. This, and an attack error
by UCI at 13-13, were what closed
out the match for the Cardinal.
The very last point was a team
effort led by Irvin and Mochalski.
The two seniors have been critical
to Stanford's success and leader
ship of the team, making it fitting
that the match would end with
them. Irvin chased down a ball, and
Mochalski ended with the kill to win
the match.
"Irvin chasing down that ball in
the last rally of the match, and us
being patient in that situation, was
key," Kosty said. "We didn't go for
the kill right away. We wanted to
see if we could get a better opportu
nity and we did."
Stanford will travel to Provo,
Utah on Thursday to play Pepper
dine in the first semifinal match of

er side of the bracket, BYU will

was able to get within five points
during the fourth set, the Anteaters
won by eight points at 25-17.
The whole match, but especially
the final set, was a true nail-biter.
UCI went ahead early but the Car
dinal tied it at 7-7. Irvin then had
two critical kills to put the Cardinal
ahead at 11-9. When the Anteaters
took the lead at 13-12 and Stanford
found itself in dangerous territory,
however, Maples seemed incredibly
on edge and both teams seemed
nervous but confident.
It was Stanford's consistent and
impressive service game that gave
them the final advantage, to rally
the team from behind and produce
the last critical points of the match.
Senior Scott Sakaida, a serving spe
cialist, served the last three points
of the match, creating the opportu

nity for Stanford to control the last
three points in order to get the best
attacks. This, and an attack error
by UCI at 13-13, were what closed
out the match for the Cardinal.
The very last point was a team
effort led by Irvin and Mochalski.
The two seniors have been critical
to Stanford's success and leader
ship of the team, making it fitting
that the match would end with
them. Irvin chased down a ball, and
Mochalski ended with the kill to win
the match.
"Irvin chasing down that ball in
the last rally of the match, and us
being patient in that situation, was
key," Kosty said. "We didn't go for
the kill right away. We wanted to
see if we could get a better opportu
nity and we did."
Stanford will travel to Provo,
Utah on Thursday to play Pepper
dine in the first semifinal match of
the MPSF Tournament. On the oth
er side of the bracket, BYU will
host No. 4 seed UC-Santa Barbara
in the second semifinal match. The
winners of the two matches will face
each other in the championship
match next week.

The No. 3 Stanford men's volleyball
team defeated No. 6 UC-Irvine in a
thrilling five-set match at Maples Pavil
ion, winning their first match of the
MPSF Tournament (28-30,25-22,25-15,
17-25, 15-13). The Cardinal extended
their winning streak to 12 straight
matches and will travel to Utah this
Thursday to face No. 2 seed Pepperdine
in the semifinals.

Saturday's match was high intensity
from the beginning, with both teams
clearly ready to battle to keep their
MPSF Championship title hopes alive
with a spot in the semifinals. But while
both the Anteaters and the Cardinal
played impressively and demonstrated
why they are top teams in the country,
it was Stanford's confident poise, home
court advantage and ability to capitalize
off UCl's errors that ultimately won the
match for them.
The Cardinal are currently one of
the most dominant teams in the MPSF
and lately have seemed truly invincible.
When discussing the winning streak,
head coach John Kosty said the team
has "been doing it with patience and
confidence." The 12-match winning
streak is the second-longest for the
Cardinal in program history, with the
longest being a 16-match streak during
the 1996 season.
Stanford started the match strong
with an ace from senior outside hitter
Eric Mochalski, putting the Cardinal up
4-1 in the first set. But UCI made it
clear early on that it would not be de
feated easily. The first set was relative
ly even as it was at one point tied at nine

hitting above.6oo and serving ex
ceptionally well.
UCI soon took the lead and was
winning 21-18 before Stanford cut
the lead to 23-22, forcing an
Anteaters timeout. Stanford tied
the match at 23-23 with a kill from
senior Brian Cook and capitalized
off of an attack error by the
Anteaters to go up 25-24. The next
few points were back and forth with
neither team wanting to give up the
first set. However, Stanford was the
first to blink and UCI won the first
set 30-28.
In the second set, Stanford once
again was hitting .600 and took the
lead early on. Stanford increased its
energy, playing with intensity and
aggressive offense that allowed
them to maintain the lead through
out the second set. While UCI cut
the lead to 19-18, Stanford won the
set 25-22 and tied the match at one
set apiece.
The third set was the most im
pressive for Stanford's defense,

with an especially impressive block
ing performance. Sophomore Con
rad Kaminski had three straight
blocks to put the Cardinal up 15-6
and then followed the blocks with a
kill to put the Cardinal up 19-8.
Stanford dominated the third set
while the Anteaters began to look a
little overwhelmed.
UCI pulled it together in the
fourth set to rally and tie the match
at two sets each. While Stanford
