# UPSET DOWN SOUTH
## 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
It was an up-and-down road
trip to Southern California for the
No. 13 Stanford lacrosse team
(12-3, 6-2 MPSF), which first
clinched a berth in the MPSF
Tournament on Friday with a 15-
10 victory over San Diego State
(6-9,3-5) before suffering a tough
11-10 loss to USC (8-7, 6-3) on
Sunday to drop to third in the
conference with one match re
maining in the regular season.

Friday's victory was defined
by one big run, as the Cardinal
only owned a 4-3 lead with eight
minutes to go in the first half be
fore the offense surged and
scored ten consecutive goals in a
streak spanning halftime to put
the match out of reach early. Al
though the Aztecs eventually re
gained their footing and scored
seven times in the second half,
the damage had already been
done, and Stanford cruised to its
12th victory of the season.
Sophomore midfielder Lucy
Dikeou, freshman attacker
Kelsey Murray and senior at
tacker Rachel Ozer each con
tributed two goals during that

10-0 run. Both Dikeou and Mur
ray notched hat tricks overall to
lead the offense against the
Aztecs. Although San Diego
State took six more shots than
Stanford (31-25), Stanford was
much more efficient on its oppor
tunities, converting its shots at a
60 percent clip against the
Aztecs' 32 percent, which ulti
mately gave it the edge.
Sunday's match against the
Trojans was much more dramat
ic, with four lead changes and
five ties leading to a neck-ancl
neck nailbiter in which USC ulti
mately edged the Cardinal to
move into sole possession of
fourth place in the conference.
The match was a matter of
missed opportunities for the Car
dinal, which outshot the Trojans
27-16, including 4-0 in the final 11
minutes. Stanford was ultimately
unable to capitalize and fell just
short. Although the Cardinal
jumped out to a late 10-9 lead on
a goal by junior attacker Kyle
Fraser, the Trojans ultimately
bounced back two minutes later
with two goals in a span of 28 sec
onds to take the final 11-10 ad
vantage, with the defense buck
ling down and holding the Cardi
nal scoreless afterward.
Dikeou, Ozer and freshman
midfielder Alex Poplawski all
contributed two goals each in the
loss, with Dikeou's goals giving
her five for the road trip to lead

the team. Ozer and Poplawski
were not far behind with four
apiece. Dikeou has now scored 15
goals in her last five games, and
has jumped into the team lead
with 26 goals on the season. Farr,
Murray, Ozer and Poplawski are
also each above 20 goals on the
season to spearhead a balanced
offensive attack for the Cardinal,
which boast the nation's 14th
highest offensive output sec
ond in the conference behind
Oregon with 13.67 goals
scored per match.
Moving forward, Stanford
will need a little help in order to
clinch the second seed and a
first-round bye in the upcoming
MPSF Tournament, as the Car
dinal currently sit behind both
Denver and Oregon in the con
ference standings. Although
Stanford is out of the running for
the top overall seed, if the Cardi
nal can defeat California in their
regular-season finale later this
week and Oregon loses either of
its final two matches to confer
ence-leading Denver or Cal in
the final stretch of its regular
season, Stanford holds the
tiebreaker over the Ducks and
would slide into the second seed.
Stanford will close out the
regular season with a home duel
with Cal on Thursday at 4 p.m.

seven times in the second half,
the damage had already been
done, and Stanford cruised to its
12th victory of the season.
Sophomore midfielder Lucy
Dikeou, freshman attacker
Kelsey Murray and senior at
tacker Rachel Ozer each con
tributed two goals during that

10-0 run. Both Dikeou and Mur
ray notched hat tricks overall to
lead the offense against the
Aztecs. Although San Diego
State took six more shots than
Stanford (31-25), Stanford was
much more efficient on its oppor
tunities, converting its shots at a
60 percent clip against the
Aztecs' 32 percent, which ulti
mately gave it the edge.
Sunday's match against the
Trojans was much more dramat
ic, with four lead changes and
five ties leading to a neck-ancl
neck nailbiter in which USC ulti
mately edged the Cardinal to
move into sole possession of
fourth place in the conference.
The match was a matter of
missed opportunities for the Car
dinal, which outshot the Trojans
27-16, including 4-0 in the final 11
minutes. Stanford was ultimately
unable to capitalize and fell just
short. Although the Cardinal
jumped out to a late 10-9 lead on
a goal by junior attacker Kyle
Fraser, the Trojans ultimately
bounced back two minutes later
with two goals in a span of 28 sec
onds to take the final 11-10 ad
vantage, with the defense buck
ling down and holding the Cardi
nal scoreless afterward.
Dikeou, Ozer and freshman
midfielder Alex Poplawski all
contributed two goals each in the
loss, with Dikeou's goals giving
her five for the road trip to lead

the team. Ozer and Poplawski
were not far behind with four
apiece. Dikeou has now scored 15
goals in her last five games, and
has jumped into the team lead
with 26 goals on the season. Farr,
Murray, Ozer and Poplawski are
also each above 20 goals on the
season to spearhead a balanced
offensive attack for the Cardinal,
which boast the nation's 14th
highest offensive output sec
ond in the conference behind
Oregon with 13.67 goals
scored per match.
Moving forward, Stanford
will need a little help in order to
clinch the second seed and a
first-round bye in the upcoming
MPSF Tournament, as the Car
dinal currently sit behind both
Denver and Oregon in the con
ference standings. Although
Stanford is out of the running for
the top overall seed, if the Cardi
nal can defeat California in their
regular-season finale later this
week and Oregon loses either of
its final two matches to confer
ence-leading Denver or Cal in
the final stretch of its regular
season, Stanford holds the
tiebreaker over the Ducks and
would slide into the second seed.
Stanford will close out the
regular season with a home duel
with Cal on Thursday at 4 p.m.
