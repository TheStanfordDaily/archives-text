# MISSED IT BY THAT MUCH
## Gymnastics falls short in semifinals 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
The No. 10 Stanford women's gym
nastics team saw its national title aspira
tions come to an early end on Friday
when it finished fourth at its NCAA
Championships Session I semifinal, just
one place shy of qualifying for the finals
and rendering it unable to clinch its sec
ond Super Six berth in the last three sea
sons. However, despite the disappointing
team finish, three Cardinal gymnasts
advanced to the Individual Finals and
claimed first-team All-America honors
to close out their seasons.
Stanford finished with a score of
196.600, behind eventual national co
champion No. 2 Oklahoma (197.500), No.
6 Georgia (197.300) and No. 3 LSU
(197.100). The loss ended another strong
season in which Stanford finished sec
ond at the Pac-12 Championships and
second at the NCAA Baton Rouge Re
gional with scores over 197.000, a mark
of which it fell just short at the national
semifinals.
There were some particularly im
pressive performances from the highly

talented field of individuals, espe
cially on bars, where senior Rristina
Vaculik claimed a share of first place
with her 9.925. Senior Shona Mor
gan and junior Samantha Shapiro
finished in a five-way tie for third
with scores of 9.900. Morgan again
tied her career high score as she did
at the NCAA Regional, and was re
warded for her efforts with a first
team All-America honor, the first of
her career.
"Shona has done a great job
since the day she arrived and was
great all year," said Stanford head
coach Kristen Smyth to GoStan
ford.com. "You couldn't ask for
more out of anybody than what she
gave. She loves her team and Stan
ford women's gymnastics. She rep
resented our program better than
we could have ever asked for."
Meanwhile, Vaculik was also im
pressive on the beam, finishing in a
tie for second with 9.900 to add to
her stellar performance on bars. Al
though she had spectacular routines
on bars, vault and beam, she had to
bounce back from a shaky day on
floor, on which she suffered a deduc
tion to finish with just a 9.600.
"The biggest thing about Rristi
na was how she bounced back after
her floor routine," Smyth said to
GoStanford.com. "She came back
and did great on her next three
events. It showed a lot of growth
and leadership potential for the fu
ture. She's done a great job all year,
but I see her making those steps to
become an even better leader every
time she steps out on the floor."
Vaculik's shaky floor routine was
part of a subpar performance on
floor for the team as a whole to start
the meet, which earned just 49.025,
making for an early setback. Anoth
er 49.025 in the vault to follow the
floor put Stanford in an even bigger
hole alongside unforgiving competi
tion. The deficit was ultimately too
much for Stanford to overcome.
Freshmen Nicolette and

Danielle McNair had impressive
performances in their first NCAA
Championship meets, with both
recording scores over 9.800 in each
of their events. Freshman Rachel
Daum also stood out with her trio of
scores of over 9.800 on vault, beam
and floor.
At the Individual Finals on the
following day, Shapiro and Vaculik
finished second and third respec
tively in bars, while Morgan fin
ished ninth to cap off a spectacular
trio of performances for the three
newly crowned first-team All-
Americans. Vaculik also contributed
a seventh-place finish on beam later
to add to her impressive resume.
With the season coming to an
end, Stanford will head into the off
season without the team result that
it desired at the national champi
onships, but with a talented and ex
perienced corps of young gymnasts
that will look to continue making
their mark on the program into the
future.
