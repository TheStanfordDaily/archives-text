## The
						real cost of inaction on immigration 
### SUPER TUESDAY Aimee Trujillo 
As time keeps passing, Con
gress remains at a standstill.
Amidst the ever-increasing
problems with the broken U.S. im
migration system, the House of
Representatives has yet to put the
Senate's immigration reform bill,
5.744, on the floor for a vote. The
House has essentially resigned the
bill to a limbo for the past ten
months, neither passing nor re
forming the bill since the Senate
passed it in 2013. Republican House
Speaker John Boehner leads the
Republican sentiment that the GOP
will not accept a comprehensive im
migration reform bill passed by the
Democratic-controlled Senate
even though it has strong bipartisan
support.
The House has been under heat
for its extreme inefficiency and its
refusal to put immigration reform
on its calendar. Since June 27,2013,
there are over 1 million newly eligi
ble immigrant voters, now part of
the overwhelming majority of 75
percent of Americans who believe
the nation's immigration policy is in
need of sweeping changes. This is
bad news for the House Republi
cans who continue to block immi
gration reform. People are voicing
then- opinions, and yet they contin
ue to be ignored on Capitol Hill.
The political costs of inaction
could drastically impact the out
comes of the 2014 election. Econom
ic costs, likewise, are already build
ing up. Analysis has shown that the
U.S. economy is falling behind
every day that immigration reform
is not passed. Under 5.744, stream
lined pathways to legal immigration
would expand the economy and
boost tax revenues. America's GDP
could increase up to $l5O billion per
year from increased earnings due to
legalizing immigrants.
Additionally, a failure to pass
any sort of immigration reform
means that the U.S. would be losing
the benefits that could come with a
larger labor force, higher produc
tivity and investment and the inno
vation and entrepreneurship of
skilled immigrants. Under 5.744,
the visa cap would increase for H
-1B workers with at least a bache
lor's degree who come to work tem
porarily in a specialty occupation.
5.744 would also exempt foreign
students who graduate with ad
vanced degrees and job offers in a
STEM field from numerical immi

gration limits.
Overall, these reforms would
help streamline the process for
highly-skilled and highly-educated
workers to come to the U.S. Immi
grants are driving entrepreneur
ship and job creation in America,
contrary to claims that immigrants
are stealing American jobs
which conflates immigration and
outsourcing. In fact, a look at the
numbers show that immigrants are
more likely to open local businesses
and create local jobs. Immigrants
started 28 percent of all new U.S.
businesses in 2011 and account for
24 percent of patents twice their
share of the population.
Not only does immigration boost
American job creation, but it also
increases the productivity of the
American workforce. Economists
show that immigration helps stimu
late investment and promote spe
cialization, resulting in higher U.S.
GDP and higher wages for all work
ers in the country.
While economic concerns are at
the forefront of debate over immi
gration and the statistics undoubt
edly show that the U.S. benefits
greatly from immigration, these
facts should not be the only reasons
driving immigration reform. The
question being asked so often is
"What can immigrants do for the
country?" However, the real ques
tion we should be asking ourselves
is "What is the right thing to do?"
In the past 297 days since the
Senate passed their reforms, there
have been over 330,000 deportations
of immigrants that could have bene
fited from the new reforms. These
deportations are tearing families
apart across the border. The recent
increase in deportation of undocu
mented immigrants has left thou
sands of children in foster care. But
being an immigrant, documented or
not, doesn't make someone any less
of a person. We cannot reduce immi
grants down to dollar signs.
What America needs now is ac
tion. There are political, economic
and personal costs to everyone for
every day that immigration reform
remains merely an idea rather than
a reality. 297 days is enough already.
The time is now for Congress to
pass the immigration reform that
this country so desperately needs.
