### SUPER TUESDAY Anthony Ghosn 
In some senses, the Senate im
migration bill, 5.744, is a con
tradiction of all of the modern
day caricatures we have about
Washington. A bipartisan group of
eight senators, including political
heavyweights John McCain (R-AZ)
and Chuck Schumer (D-NY), au
thored the bill. It is progressive in
content and implementation, a
seemingly genuine response to the
immigration problem that this
country faces. It cuts costs: Accord
ing to the Congressional Budget
Office (CBO), it would reduce the
deficit by $1 trillion over 20 years.
It focuses on the people by giving
millions of non-legal immigrants
the chance to obtain legal residence
in this country. Most surprisingly,
enough Senate Democrats and Re

publicans actually agreed on it to
get the bill passed submitted it to
the House by a vote of 68-32.
The "Border Security, Economic
Opportunity, and Immigration
Modernization Act" focuses on in
creasing the technological sophis
tication of our border monitoring
techniques, increasing visa allot
ments for more educated foreign
nationals and permitting existing
illegal immigrants the chance to
legally legitimize their residence
in the United States. One thing
that everybody agrees on is that
the current situation, with con
stant inflows of illegal immi
grants, is unacceptable. 5.744 is,
for once, a real legal attempt to

solve the persistent limitations of
the United States' current immi
gration framework.
Here is the rub: The bill will
never be signed into law.
Despite the fact that the bill was
co-authored by Republicans and
Democrats and that 92 amend
ments were passed on the bill to
satisfy the concerns of various Sen
ators, there is no chance that the
bill will see the President's pen.
Speaker of the House John Boehn
er (R-OH) says he will obey the
Hastei't Rule, which states that as
long as the Republicans control the
House, any bill will require the sup
port of a majority of the Republi
can caucus in order to be moved to
the floor.

The Hastert Rule is a clever po
litical tool that both Republicans
and Democrats often employ. Re
publicans, who control the House,
internally vote on a Speaker of the
House so that they can all agree on
one person to vote for in the full
Speaker election even if a mi
nority of House Republicans do not
agree with the Speaker, they will
still vote for Boehner rather than
risk handing the speakership to the
Democrats. Thus, Boehner's obedi
ence to the Hastert Rule ensures
that he cannot be overthrown by
his own caucus. With Boehner as
saulted from both the left (the De
mocrats) and the right (the Tea

Party), he needs to make sure he
keeps his support. But at what
price?
With a majority of House Re
publicans against the bill, Speaker
Boehner insisted that "The House
is going to do its own job in devel
oping an immigration bill." Al
though the Tea Party is now some
what muted, Boehner needs to hold
to the Hastert Rule nevertheless.
The importance of their support
was made clear to him when, de
spite coming to an agreement with
the President on the terms of the
debt ceiling, he could not get the
house to vote his way some years
ago.
This much-needed reform is go
ing to go totally unrealized unless
the Republican majority gets un
seated in the midterm elections, or
the Democrats agree to support
Boehner in any Speaker election
and they would rather wait for the
next midterms and watch the Re
publicans embarrass themselves in
the meantime. The reality is that
the reason the law will not be
passed has almost nothing to do
with the law and everything to do
with political divisions in Washing
ton. There are so many conflicting
interests at play that the real prob
lem trying to be addressed is en
tirely overshadowed by politics.
Millions of men and women who
came to this country pursuing free
dom and happiness, but their
chance at getting a real shot at be
ing American has been pulled away
by the hard reality of political dys
function. It such a shame that this
has become a normal political ex-

pectation for Americans.
It seems like we sometimes for
get that the words United States
were once considered to be radical
because they brought Dutchmen,
Englishmen and Frenchmen to
gether under one government. And
Americans did this because they
considered the immigrant an
American and not a foreigner. This
country's vitality was based largely
in its openness to new Americans.
They are great inventors and busi
ness people, with over 40 percent of
Fortune 500 companies being
founded by immigrants or their
children. We have come so far in
some respects, but in others we
have completely degenerated. The
state of our political system is gen
uinely dire and the story of this bill
harshly juxtaposes for us what
could be against what is. Immigra
tion reform is a reminder that
there is hope and then there is gov
ernment, not the other way around.
