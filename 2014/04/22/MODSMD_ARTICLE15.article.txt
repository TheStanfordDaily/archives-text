# ANDREWS ASSESSMENT
## Body beautiful 
### McKenzie Andrews 
Stanford doesn't have fat peo
ple. At least, it seems that
way. If you're looking around
Arrillaga, you soon realize that be
tween the pre-made salad, tofu, and
Israeli couscous options, we don't
reflect the general statistics on
American obesity. California is a
land of yoga, kale and avocados, all
of which contribute to a general
emphasis on maintaining a some
times-extreme healthy lifestyle.
Stanford's dining halls offer an
incredibly rich selection of both
healthy and non-healthy options.
Friends have said they have a more
varied dining experience in dining
halls than at home, and I can't deny
that an omelet and smoothie at
Wilbur brunch leaves me pleasant
ly stuffed with good food. You can
switch from Stern burritos to bur
rito bowls or salads, and there are a
plethora of healthy options at any
of the many dining halls on campus.
Not only do we have amazing,
good-for-you food, but also, our stu
dent-athletes set an example for
the rest of us by maintaining in
credible bodies and dedicated fit
ness routines. Armed with free
books and the flood of athletic gear
otherwise known as Nike Christ

mas, our athletes are pretty uni
formly good-looking individuals.
I've been lucky to room with two
Division I athletes since coming to
Stanford: caring, smart girls who
also happen to be some of the best
lacrosse and field hockey players
I've met. Seeing your roommate's
rocking body on a daily basis is a
motivator to get to the gym. Given
that they may be practicing three
to four hours, I can probably bust
thirty minutes on the elliptical ma
chine.
I was reflecting over the week
end at a conference with other uni
versities on why I chose Stanford
over other similarly elite North
eastern universities. To be honest,
a huge factor was the weather and
a sighting of the men's soccer team
fountain hopping shirtless at Admit
Weekend.
A friend at Harvard recently
sent me an article published in
their student newspaper about how
Stanford is a better place to be, and
our newest class of 2018 is officially
the most exclusive group ever: its
admit rate was 5.07 percent. We top
the charts as America's dream
school; however, there's also a
darker side that's not advertised in
admissions material.
Like any college, Stanford is not
immune to body image issues, and
I'd argue we're perhaps worse, in
that diseases such as anorexia are
highly correlated with high
achievement. A friend studying
abroad described an experience of
one girl who had their group enter
and then leave four different
restaurants in the search for a ham
sandwich, so she could just pick off
the meat. Other universities may
spend a substantial part of the year
below freezing, requiring every
body to wear sweatshirts and mul
tiple layers. At Stanford, as a friend
once said, "When you're wearing
yoga pants and a tank top, we know
what you look like."

According to the Massachusetts
Eating Disorders Association, 91
percent of college women have at
tempted to control their weight
through dieting. One survey by the
National Eating Disorders Associa
tion found that nearly 20 percent of
a surveyed group of male and fe
male college students indicated that
they had or previously had eating
disorders such as bulimia, anorexia,
or binge-eating. They also noted
that because so few students seek
treatment, it's difficult to say how
serious the problem is on campuses.
They also noted that eating disor
ders have the highest mortality rate
of any psychiatric disorder, and a
suicide rate that is fifty times high
er the general population.
There can be a negative side to
our extreme achievement when it
comes to body image. Every shape,
every size and every one is beauti
ful. Eating and exercise are some of
my favorite activities, but they
shouldn't be our shackles. If you're
a young Stanford student, it's hard
not to be conscious of how you look.
At a school that strives for excel
lence, that pressure can sometime
manifest itself in unhealthy ways.
I have a friend who used to be a
great high school cross-country
runner and now is rooming with an
ex-Olympian track star. Your meas
ure of talent in every area rises and
readjusts, and it's humbling. My
friend's roommate has encouraged
him to develop Stanford's Running
Club, and as a leader he is able to
provide competitive running op
tions to non-varsity athletes. I have
another politically minded friend
whose rowing team roommate has
encouraged him to go to the gym at
midnight and take random jogs into
Palo Alto. Stanford's one of the best
universities on earth, and it's impor
tant we stay healthy healthily.
