# RIDING THE WAVE
## 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Fresh off an important series
win over conference rival Arizona
State, Stanford baseball (15-17, 6-9
Pac-12) hopes to continue building
positive momentum as it travels to
face local opponent Santa Clara (17-
22, 8-7 WCC) on Tuesday night.
The Cardinal have seemingly
put a disappointing start to the sea
son in the rearview mirror by win
ning four of its last five games, in
cluding two walk-off victories. Al
though the Cardinal offense still
only produced seven runs over the
course of the three-game series
against the Sun Devils, Stanford's
pitching more than made up for it,
with junior John Hochstatter espe
cially shining in his shutout victory
and near-no-hitter on Sunday.
Both walk-off victories for the
Cardinal came in back-to-back
games off the bat of senior first
baseman Danny Diekroeger, who
earned Pac-12 Player of the Week
honors for his performance.
Diekroeger finished the week 7-for
-17 at the plate (a .412 batting aver

age) and added his first home run
of the season in Sunday's 1-0 victo
ry, his third game-winning hit of the
week. The Pac-12 Player of the
Week award to Diekroeger was the
first such honor this season for the
Cardinal and the first of
Diekroeger's career.
Stanford enters as a favorite
against Santa Clara, a team that
has struggled to keep opponents off
the board for much of the season.
The Broncos have a 4.36 team
ERA and have allowed eight or
more runs 11 times this season. In
its three games played against
other Pac-12 opponents Washing
ton and Arizona State, Santa Clara
has gone 0-3 and allowed 24 total
runs.
However, the Broncos are en
tering the series on a three-game
winning streak after sweeping the
University of San Diego on the road
this past weekend. The normally
shaky Broncos bullpen allowed only
four earned runs in 14 innings of
work over the series, picking up
much-needed victories for the team
after it lost four of its previous five.
Offensively, Santa Clara is led by

senior outfielder Greg Harisis. Hari
sis leads the team in nearly every
category, with 40 hits, 33 runs, nine
doubles, three home runs and a .312
batting average, all topping the
Broncos' lineup. On-base specialist
and catcher Stevie Berman comple
ments Harisis, generally the leadoff
hitter, further down the lineup.
Berman hits .309 and leads the team
with 19 walks and nine hit-by-pitch
es, combining to give him a .431 on
base percentage.
If the Cardinal hope to make the
postseason, their offense will need
to pick up the pace. The Cardinal no
longer have a player hitting above
.300 or with an on-base percentage
above .400. The team's .247 batting
average ranks it ninth in the Pac-12.
Despite the team's poor per
formance at the plate, junior third
baseman Alex Blandino continues
to lead the team with a .299 batting
average and four home runs.
Diekroeger and sophomore Zach
Hoffpauir, who has raised his aver
age by over 100 points since March
1 to .283, have also played impres
sively well recently.
The Card will likely use a stable

of pitchers for the game but may
use freshman Tyler Thorne as the
starter on the mound. Thorne has
started in all but one midweek non
conference game so far this season
for the Cardinal, compiling a 2-0
record with a 3.52 ERA in 12 ap
pearances, four of which were
starts. Stanford's pitching has dom
inated this season with a 3.27 team

ERA. The Cardinal only surren
dered six runs over the series
against Arizona State.
First pitch between Stanford
and Santa Clara is scheduled for 6
p.m. in Moraga, Calif., on Tiiesday
night.

cluding two walk-off victories. Al
though the Cardinal offense still
only produced seven runs over the
course of the three-game series
against the Sun Devils, Stanford's
pitching more than made up for it,
with junior John Hochstatter espe
cially shining in his shutout victory
and near-no-hitter on Sunday.
Both walk-off victories for the
Cardinal came in back-to-back
games off the bat of senior first
baseman Danny Diekroeger, who
earned Pac-12 Player of the Week
honors for his performance.
Diekroeger finished the week 7-for
-17 at the plate (a .412 batting aver

age) and added his first home run
of the season in Sunday's 1-0 victo
ry, his third game-winning hit of the
week. The Pac-12 Player of the
Week award to Diekroeger was the
first such honor this season for the
Cardinal and the first of
Diekroeger's career.
Stanford enters as a favorite
against Santa Clara, a team that
has struggled to keep opponents off
the board for much of the season.
The Broncos have a 4.36 team
ERA and have allowed eight or
more runs 11 times this season. In
its three games played against
other Pac-12 opponents Washing
ton and Arizona State, Santa Clara
has gone 0-3 and allowed 24 total
runs.
However, the Broncos are en
tering the series on a three-game
winning streak after sweeping the
University of San Diego on the road
this past weekend. The normally
shaky Broncos bullpen allowed only
four earned runs in 14 innings of
work over the series, picking up
much-needed victories for the team
after it lost four of its previous five.
Offensively, Santa Clara is led by

senior outfielder Greg Harisis. Hari
sis leads the team in nearly every
category, with 40 hits, 33 runs, nine
doubles, three home runs and a .312
batting average, all topping the
Broncos' lineup. On-base specialist
and catcher Stevie Berman comple
ments Harisis, generally the leadoff
hitter, further down the lineup.
Berman hits .309 and leads the team
with 19 walks and nine hit-by-pitch
es, combining to give him a .431 on
base percentage.
If the Cardinal hope to make the
postseason, their offense will need
to pick up the pace. The Cardinal no
longer have a player hitting above
.300 or with an on-base percentage
above .400. The team's .247 batting
average ranks it ninth in the Pac-12.
Despite the team's poor per
formance at the plate, junior third
baseman Alex Blandino continues
to lead the team with a .299 batting
average and four home runs.
Diekroeger and sophomore Zach
Hoffpauir, who has raised his aver
age by over 100 points since March
1 to .283, have also played impres
sively well recently.
The Card will likely use a stable

of pitchers for the game but may
use freshman Tyler Thorne as the
starter on the mound. Thorne has
started in all but one midweek non
conference game so far this season
for the Cardinal, compiling a 2-0
record with a 3.52 ERA in 12 ap
pearances, four of which were
starts. Stanford's pitching has dom
inated this season with a 3.27 team

ERA. The Cardinal only surren
dered six runs over the series
against Arizona State.
First pitch between Stanford
and Santa Clara is scheduled for 6
p.m. in Moraga, Calif., on Tiiesday
night.
