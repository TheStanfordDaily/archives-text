# NO ROOM FOR ERROR
## 
### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After falling short of winning a crucial series in Salt
Lake City against Utah, the Stanford softball team (26-
18,3-12 Pae-12) will welcome the Santa Clara Broncos (7-
26, 2-4 WCC) to Smith Family Stadium on Ihesday
evening.
The Card have no room for error over the last 11
games of their season if they hope to extend their streak
of consecutive postseason appearances to 17. This pres
sure certainly extends to the Cardinal's matchup with the
Broncos; with Santa Clara currently holding an RPI of
258, the Card must win this non-conference matchup to
keep its weak postseason aspirations alive.
As evidenced by their record and RPI, the Broncos
have had a rough 2014 campaign. Santa Clara lost 10
games in a row to begin its season, and since the start of
conference play, Santa Clara has yet to win a series
against a conference opponent. Furthermore, the Bron
cos have won consecutive games only once all season, with
five run-rule losses on their record.
In a tough season for the Broncos, center fielder

Stephanie Fisher has been a bright spot for Santa Clara's
offense. Fisher, a senior from Tracy, Calif., has hit .379
with nine doubles, two home runs and 15 RBIs. Along
with holding the team lead in batting average and dou
bles, she also leads her team in on-base percentage and
total bases with a .393 mark and 58 bags respectively.
Against the Cardinal on Thesday, the Broncos will al
so turn to Kelly Scribner to provide some power in the
heart of the Santa Clara lineup. Scribner has slugged a
team-best .570 while starting in all 33 games for the Bron
cos. The senior from Loveland, Colo, also holds the high
mark in home runs for Santa Clara, with six homers in 93
at-bats.
Santa Clara has struggled mightily in getting runners
on base, posting an anemic team on-base percentage of
.294. Drawing walks has been a huge problem for the Bron
cos, as Santa Clara has only received 45 free passes as a
team all season. Once the Broncos have gotten runners on
base, they have been very poor on the basepaths, with a 53
percent stolen base success rate in 2014.
On top of the Broncos' offensive difficulties, then- rota
tion has also been a mess, with a team ERA of 4.49. Santa
Clara pitchers have struggled to finish games for their
team, as Santa Clara has only 10 complete games in its 33
contests this year. Finally, Santa Clara's opponents have
teed off on Bronco pitching to the tune of a .308 batting av
erage and 85 extra-base hits, including 12 home runs,
charged to Santa Clara pitchers.
As the top pitcher in the Santa Clara rotation, Ciara
Gonzales has had a passable season for the Broncos. The
sophomore from Chandler, Ariz, has posted a 3.39 ERA in
14 starts and 27 appearances for Santa Clara. Gonzales has
logged the majority of innings in the circle for the Broncos,
going the distance in half of her starts this season.
For the Cardinal, freshman Kylie Sorenson continues
to help lead the Card's potent offensive attack. Sorenson,
a Stevenson Ranch, Calif, native, has had a sensational
debut season on the Farm for Stanford. She leads the
Cardinal in several offensive categories, including batting
average (.371), on-base percentage (.506), slugging per
centage (.629) and walks (33).
In recognition of her tremendous season, Sorenson
was selected last week as one of 25 finalists for the inau
gural NFCA Freshman of the Year Award. Sorenson will
also continue to be in contention to become the second
consecutive Cardinal player to win the Pac-12 Freshman
of the Year award, after Kayla Bonstrom won the recog
nition last season.
Sorenson will certainly face strong competition for
the honor from players around the Pac-12. Arizona
freshman Katyiana Mauga, who leads the Pac-12 in
slugging percentage (.938) by more than 100 points, and
UCLA newcomer Delaney Spaulding, who is currently
third in on-base percentage in the Pac-12 with a .526
mark, will also be in contention for the award.
Stanford and Santa Clara will square off at 6 p.m. on
Tuesday evening, with a formidable series looming on
the horizon in No. 1 Oregon on Friday, Saturday and
Sunday at Smith Family Stadium.
