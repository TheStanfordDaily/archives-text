# Code Camp empowers high school students
## Girls Teach Girls To Code finds extensive interest 
### CATHERINE ZAW | MANAGING EDITOR 
Last weekend, Girls Teach Girls To Code
(GTGTC), a program sponsored by the
Computer Science Department, hosted
over 200 high school girls on campus for a
"Code Camp" that aimed to introduce them
to the various real-life applications of com
puter science.
The all-day event, which took place in
the Hewlett Teaching Center and the Gates
Computer Science Building, was Stanford's
second Code Camp, according to GTGTC
founder and coordinator Heidi Wang 'l4.
Code Camp is the largest annual event that
GTGTC puts on, involving close to 50 Stan
ford student volunteers who mentor the
high school students. Volunteers give a
morning presentation to all participants be
fore they are broken into groups in the af
ternoon to learn in student-created work
shops.
"In the afternoon, they can explore two

special tracks that they're interested in, like
web development or puzzle solving
there's eight of them," said Jessie Duan 'l5,
another GTGTC coordinator. "Then there's
a career panel later in the afternoon."
The event proved to be extremely popu
lar, according to Wang, with well over 250
high school students signing up.
Participants, who had come from all over
the Bay Area, expressed a variety of ratio
nales for coming to Code Camp.
"I'm currently taking AP Computer Sci
ence and learning HTML on the side," said
Rhea Manocha, a sophomore from Pleasan
ton. "I was interested in robotics and code
breaking."
"I've been learning [computer science]
for about a few months and I was interested
in learning from actual people that are in
the field," said Alisa Nandas, a high school
student from San Jose. "[Learning comput

er science] is like learning another [foreign]
language it would help me learn so many
things."
Although not all interested high school
students were able to join them for Code
Camp, GTGTC also provides smaller-scale
events throughout the academic year, in
cluding company tours and visits to the
Computer History Museum in Mountain
View.
According to Duan, GTGTC reaches out
to high school students not only through
various mailing lists and parent or teacher
connections, but also through liaisons
high school students that work directly with
them to coordinate publicity within their
own schools.
"A lot of girls hear about us through
word of mouth, too," Duan added.
Given increasing demand for GTGTC's
programming, the group has plans for ex
pansion, including trying to host Code
Camp biannually as opposed to once in the
spring. Wang also voiced aspirations be
yond the Stanford campus.
"In the far future, we're hoping that this
is an organization with chapters in different
colleges," Wang said. "You can imagine if it
was offered to girls across the nation and
the world, how many girls we could reach
and the impact we could make."
The program's success to date has far
exceeded its founders' expectations. GT
GTC started as a kickstarter idea that
Wang had submitted to a contest in 2012,
explaining she wanted to encourage more

females to go into the field so that she could
work alongside others of her own gender.
"I went to Wellesley College, an all-girls'
school, and the summer I graduated, I did
an internship in San Francisco," Wang said.
"I was the only female technical intern, and
the contrast was really stark for me. I came
from Wellesley, a classroom full of girls do
ing CS, and then suddenly I was the only
one working in the office. I wish more girls
went into CS so that I could have more girls
around me and I felt like I wanted someone
to be there to tell me enter in the field in the
first place."
Duan and Wang identified several rea
sons why the gender ratio in a field like
computer science where just one in sev
en majors are female is so skewed.
"Girls in general feel like they are intim
idated by [computer science] or think that
they can't code," Wang said. "They think
that they're not good at math so therefore
they're not good at CS. There's mostly mis
conceptions about what CS is and a lack of
confidence in being able to tackle something
unknown to them."
"So one of our missions is to show high
school girls that [computer science] is really
fun and that it's flexible and can be fun in
many different ways," Duan said. "If you
have any CS knowledge, you will immedi
ately be more valuable and we want to ex
pose them to mentors that are cool and ac
cessible to them."

The mission of the Girls Teach Girls To Code program is to dispel misconceptions that
women may have about their prospects in the field of computer science.
