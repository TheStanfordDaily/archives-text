# Stanford researcher creates five-dollar chemistry set
## 
### â€” Andrew Vogeley 
Assistant Professor of Bioengineer
ing Manu Prakash recently created a
practical object that, on first impres
sion, might seem to belong in the
realm of science fiction: a five-dollar
chemistry set that can be used to
teach children about chemistry and
address global health problems like
water quality.
The set, which won the Science
Play and Research Kit
Competition, contains tiny
silicon chips that them
selves contain chemical
reagents. The set features a
punch card paper tape mod
el that allows the user to
manipulate the chemicals.
Prakash received inspi

ration for the design from a
music box his wife gave him
as a gift. The box allowed
him to realize the potential
uses of punch card paper
tape, a tool that has been
used in disciplines ranging
from computer program
ming to fabric looms.
"In one part of our lab
we've been focusing on fru
gal science and democratiz
ing scientific tools to get
them out to people around
the world who will use

them," Prakash told the
Stanford News Service.
"I'd started thinking
about this connection be
tween science education
and global health," he said.
"The things that you make
for kids to explore science
are also exactly the kind of
things that you need in the
field because they need to
be robust and they need to
be highly versatile."
