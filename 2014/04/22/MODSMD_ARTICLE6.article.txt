## New center to boost research accuracy 
### ALI GALI 
The Meta-Research Innova
tion Center at Stanford (MET
RICS), a new School of Medicine
initiative that will focus on find
ing and communicating empirical
recommendations to help im
prove the validity of medical and
broader scientific research,
opened yesterday.
According to Professor of
Medicine Steven Goodman, one
of the center's directors, scien
tists at different institutions have
sought to determine methods for
conducting more accurate re
search for many years. He ex
plained that the center will play
an important role in fby bringing
research together.
"[lt will be] a lens that helps
focus the effort of many people
and organize them so they are all
seen as a part of a collective ef
fort rather than one of separated
efforts," Goodman said.
Goodman and Professor of
Medicine John loannidis the
center's other director began
working on the initiative when
they first came to Stanford. loan
nidis emphasized the importance
of spending resources allocated
to research efficiently, given the
large amounts of effort and com
mitment research requires.
"We want to identify the best

practices to improve research ef
ficiency, test them empirically in
rigorous studies and find ways to
apply them more rigorously and
more systematically across di
verse scientific fields," loannidis
wrote in a statement to The Daily.
The directors struggled ini
tially with funding, however, be
fore eventually winning support
from the Laura and John Arnold
Foundation.
