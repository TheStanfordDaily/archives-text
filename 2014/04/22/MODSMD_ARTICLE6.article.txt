## New center to boost research accuracy 
### ALI GALI 
The Meta-Research Innova
tion Center at Stanford (MET
RICS), a new School of Medicine
initiative that will focus on find
ing and communicating empirical
recommendations to help im
prove the validity of medical and
broader scientific research,
opened yesterday.
According to Professor of
Medicine Steven Goodman, one
of the center's directors, scien
tists at different institutions have
sought to determine methods for
conducting more accurate re
search for many years. He ex
plained that the center will play
an important role in fby bringing
research together.
"[lt will be] a lens that helps
focus the effort of many people
and organize them so they are all
seen as a part of a collective ef
fort rather than one of separated
efforts," Goodman said.
Goodman and Professor of
Medicine John loannidis the
center's other director began
working on the initiative when
they first came to Stanford. loan
nidis emphasized the importance
of spending resources allocated
to research efficiently, given the
large amounts of effort and com
mitment research requires.
"We want to identify the best

practices to improve research ef
ficiency, test them empirically in
rigorous studies and find ways to
apply them more rigorously and
more systematically across di
verse scientific fields," loannidis
wrote in a statement to The Daily.
The directors struggled ini
tially with funding, however, be
fore eventually winning support
from the Laura and John Arnold
Foundation.
The directors cited two dis-

tinct factors that can impact
the accuracy of research.
First, institutional policies
that fund research may fo
cus on the marketability of
specific products rather than
the impact on science. Sec
ond, the value that compa
nies and researches place on
quantity of publications over
quality often presents a chal
lenge.
At the moment, a relative
ly small number of scientists
are associated with MET
RICS. However, Goodman
stated that they expect to at
tract many more researchers
after the center is officially

launched. Both loannidis and
Goodman emphasized that
working with scientists both
around campus and around
the globe is crucial to achiev
ing the best results.
Professor of Medicine
Randall Stafford, one of the
current METRICS-affiliated
faculty members, empha
sized the value of accurate
research results, especially
as the public tends to accept
research results without any
scrutiny.
The directors acknowl
edged that METRICS' work
will be delicate, as conducting
meta-research or "re
search on research" may
face potential biases or elicit
allegations that the center
aims to shame other re
searchers.
"We don't want to be per

ceivecl as the science police,
because we learn from our
colleagues just as we hope
that they would learn from
us," Goodman said.
The center's directors
currently aim to ensure that
scientists around the world
recognize METRICS faculty
as active members of the re
search community. loannidis
explained that meta-re
search itself is a unique and
novel field that is still in de
velopment.
"I am sure that we know
very little so far in meta-re
search compared with what
we can learn together," loan
nidis said. "I look forward to
curing some of my profound
ignorance."
