## One-and-done rale hurting the college game 
### Ashley Westhem 
To enter the NBA draft, you
have to be 19 years old and
at least a year out of high
school. This "one-and-done"
rule, which was established
by the NBA in 2005, was meant to ben
efit both the NBA and players simulta
neously; however, it has ended up to be
in the interest of the league and detri
mental to the players and college
teams in some instances.
So far, at least eight freshman have
chosen to forgo their remaining three
years of NCAA eligibility and have de
clared for the 2014 NBA draft, includ
ing the league's potential No. 1 draft
pick in Jabari Parker of Duke, Kansas'
Andrew Wiggins and Arizona's Aaron
Gordon.
The one-and-done rule creates a
set of challenges for the team depth
wise and for the players down the line
who only plan on going to school for
one year and then have no degree to
fall back on or who are ready for the
NBA right out of college and are wast
ing their time with the one-year gap
between being drafted.
I almost want to say it should be all
or nothing. Go back to how the NBA
was by allowing players to come
straight from high school or make
them get a degree, finish out their
years of eligibility with their team and
then go to the NBA.
In the NBA, there isn't much con
cept of team loyalty for players that
have been traded around or have the
prospect to be, but college ball is all
about the culture surrounding the
team and the camaraderie and concept
of working together something that
can't just be learned in one season
and that's an important part of a play
er's development. The college game
teaches players about learning to com
mit to a team, trusting your team
mates and playing within a larger
framework. "When players leave after
just one year, they miss out on the op
portunity to develop and grow as peo
ple and players.
Those players could also be affect
ing the team dynamics and culture
surrounding the program by leaving
at any moment after freshman year.
So much for recruiting. How can
coaches feel good about having the top
recruit in the nation when he has the
opportunity to ditch his college team in
favor of professional basketball after
just a year? Schools like Kentucky
(which had four freshmen declare for
the draft in 2010) have become "one
year pro factories," as described in an
article by Bleacher Report. They
make a mockery of the integrity and
spirit of the college game and recruit
ment process.
For example, UCLA is in the pre
carious position of potentially not hav
ing any guards next season, let alone a
point guard. LA Times columnist
Chris Foster said that if sophomore
Jordan Adams and junior Norman
Powell join the draft (which is not con
firmed yet), in addition to freshman
Zach LaVine and sophomore Kyle An
derson (who have already declared),
head coach Steve Alford may "need to
hang a 'guards wanted; inquire within'
sign in front of Pauley Pavilion."
A highly touted high school point
guard, Aaron Holiday is coming to the
Bruins' rescue, but not for another
year'. And if he's as good of a recruit as
he's advertised to be, then he too
might leave after his freshman year.
Obviously players might want to
make money to support themselves or
their- families through NBA contracts
by leaving after freshman years, but
players are so young when they make
that decision that all consequences
might not be considered and regrets
may linger in the long run.
I think the NFL at least has the
right idea in forcing players to attend
three years of college in order to de
clare for the NFL Draft. At that point,
the athlete is older and mature enough
to make a life-changing decision but is
also enmeshed enough in the college
experience to possibly consider just
waiting the one year to help his team
the next season and finish up his de
gree. It offers a greater incentive to
stay the extra year instead of gritting
his teeth and getting through his
freshman season, knowing that he is
going to declare for the draft at the
end of the season anyways.
The NBA might have had good in
tentions with changing to the one-and
done format, but in practice it doesn't
pan out well for the coaches who are
left high and dry without the players
they recruited and counted on, for the
teammates who are left with a deplet
ed roster and for the athlete who is
making the decision to forego college

at an age when any repercussions or
drawbacks seem inconsequential.
Change it back to straight out of
high school, change it to all four years
in college before the draft or follow
the example of the NFL, but the
NBA needs to at least consider get
ting rid of the one-and-done format. It
does no service to anyone but the
NBA, making them feel confident
that Wed and true athletes are in
each draft, instead of untested play
ers right out of high school.

Ashley Westhem seriously contem
plated forgoing her final two years
at The Daily to join Bleacher Re
port. To tell her why she made the
right decision to stay in school, con
tact her at awesthem@stanford.edu
and Tweet her @ashwestl6.
