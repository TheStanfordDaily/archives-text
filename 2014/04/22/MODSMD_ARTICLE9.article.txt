# CRUISING TO THE SWEEP
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
No. 13 Stanford men's rowing
hosted its first regatta of the year
last weekend at Redwood Shores
and had a successful Stanford Invi
tational after two consecutive week
ends on the road.
Races started Friday night un
der unfavorable conditions for the
Cardinal; although Stanford had
the luxury of not having to travel
for a third straight weekend, row
ers still had to attend classes in the
morning before preparing for their
races.

"Our guys went to class today;
everybody else was here and fo
cused on the racing," said head
coach Craig Amerkhanian. "Be
cause we're the home team, our
guys go to school, so we were disad
vantaged tonight in that regard."
"It's kind of hard [racing] here
because you get up and go to class
and you have your social life too and
then you have to come here and
switch and go into rowing mode,"
said freshman Ryan O'Rourke.
"But I think we did well."
Additionally, water conditions
were not ideal. Despite regularly
practicing Tuesday and Thursday

evenings under similar water condi
tions, no Cardinal rowers on the
roster had competed in a night re
gatta. In addition, all teams had to
compete not only with each other
but also with 20 mile-per-hour
headwinds.
However, all Cardinal boats
the number one varsity eight boat
(1V8), the number two varsity eight
boat and the freshman eight boat
swept UC-San Diego, with the
varsity boats winning by significant
margins. It was the second win in a
row for the IVB, besting the Tritons
by just over 20 seconds with a time
of 6:23.7.

On Saturday, the Cardinal took
on No. 12 Wisconsin in the morning
session and the University of San
Diego in the afternoon. The Cardi
nal ultimately finished the weekend
by sweeping its home regatta after
a tight race with Wisconsin and a
more definitive win over USD.
"It's good to cap off three weeks
straight of racing with some wins,"
said junior Kaess Smit. "We were
up against some good crews and it's
nice to get some wins at home and
be able to go back now and have the
weekend off from racing to really

make the changes we need to figure
out more speed."
The Cardinal finished ahead of
Wisconsin by three seconds in a
race that was determined in the
first 1,000 meters of the course as
the Cardinal jumped out to a lead
and were able to maintain it
through the remainder of the race.
In the second race against USD,
Stanford IVB again came out with a
strong start, pushing into open wa
ter and taking the race by 29.5 sec
onds.
"We had Wisconsin in the morn
ing and they're always a really
strong crew," said sophomore
coxswain Nathalie Weiss. "They
came out to a good start, just con
stantly crept up in the first half of
the race and then once we got the
solid lead we really held that in the
second half and we had the strong
finish, so that was an exciting race.
Then the second race of the day
against USD, we had a strong start

again and then we were able to
weigh them down and find a base
and go at a little bit of a lower
rate."
After this weekend, Stanford
IVB has won four consecutive races.
However, the team realizes that it
still has work to do in setting the
boat line-ups and improving its con
sistency.
"We know that it's a turning
point in the season and we know we
have a lot of work to do and we don't
have a race next weekend, so we're
going to use this time just looking
forward and getting better," Weiss
said.
"I think we've still got a lot of
work to do," Smit said. "There's
been a lot of figuring out lineups
and bringing new guys in and it
takes time to figure out, so these
next two weeks we've definitely got
our work cut out."
The Cardinal men got their first
full day off on Sunday to recuperate
before preparing to face California
in the Big Row at Redwood Shores
on May 3rd.

No. 13 Stanford men's rowing
hosted its first regatta of the year
last weekend at Redwood Shores
and had a successful Stanford Invi
tational after two consecutive week
ends on the road.
Races started Friday night un
der unfavorable conditions for the
Cardinal; although Stanford had
the luxury of not having to travel
for a third straight weekend, row
ers still had to attend classes in the
morning before preparing for their
races.

"Our guys went to class today;
everybody else was here and fo
cused on the racing," said head
coach Craig Amerkhanian. "Be
cause we're the home team, our
guys go to school, so we were disad
vantaged tonight in that regard."
"It's kind of hard [racing] here
because you get up and go to class
and you have your social life too and
then you have to come here and
switch and go into rowing mode,"
said freshman Ryan O'Rourke.
"But I think we did well."
Additionally, water conditions
were not ideal. Despite regularly
practicing Tuesday and Thursday

evenings under similar water condi
tions, no Cardinal rowers on the
roster had competed in a night re
gatta. In addition, all teams had to
compete not only with each other
but also with 20 mile-per-hour
headwinds.
However, all Cardinal boats
the number one varsity eight boat
(1V8), the number two varsity eight
boat and the freshman eight boat
swept UC-San Diego, with the
varsity boats winning by significant
margins. It was the second win in a
row for the IVB, besting the Tritons
by just over 20 seconds with a time
of 6:23.7.

On Saturday, the Cardinal took
on No. 12 Wisconsin in the morning
session and the University of San
Diego in the afternoon. The Cardi
nal ultimately finished the weekend
by sweeping its home regatta after
a tight race with Wisconsin and a
more definitive win over USD.
"It's good to cap off three weeks
straight of racing with some wins,"
said junior Kaess Smit. "We were
up against some good crews and it's
nice to get some wins at home and
be able to go back now and have the
weekend off from racing to really

make the changes we need to figure
out more speed."
The Cardinal finished ahead of
Wisconsin by three seconds in a
race that was determined in the
first 1,000 meters of the course as
the Cardinal jumped out to a lead
and were able to maintain it
through the remainder of the race.
In the second race against USD,
Stanford IVB again came out with a
strong start, pushing into open wa
ter and taking the race by 29.5 sec
onds.
"We had Wisconsin in the morn
ing and they're always a really
strong crew," said sophomore
coxswain Nathalie Weiss. "They
came out to a good start, just con
stantly crept up in the first half of
the race and then once we got the
solid lead we really held that in the
second half and we had the strong
finish, so that was an exciting race.
Then the second race of the day
against USD, we had a strong start

again and then we were able to
weigh them down and find a base
and go at a little bit of a lower
rate."
After this weekend, Stanford
IVB has won four consecutive races.
However, the team realizes that it
still has work to do in setting the
boat line-ups and improving its con
sistency.
"We know that it's a turning
point in the season and we know we
have a lot of work to do and we don't
have a race next weekend, so we're
going to use this time just looking
forward and getting better," Weiss
said.
"I think we've still got a lot of
work to do," Smit said. "There's
been a lot of figuring out lineups
and bringing new guys in and it
takes time to figure out, so these
next two weeks we've definitely got
our work cut out."
