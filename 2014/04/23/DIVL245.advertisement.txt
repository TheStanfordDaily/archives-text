for one session
or many!
Active Learning for Busy Skeptics
(and Busy Believers)
9:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon
Open to Stanford faculty, lecturers, postdocs, and students
This hands-on session, targeted to STEM teaching,
introduces quick and simple active learning techniques
that are effective and quick to prepare-and they
generate little or no student resistance.
Lunch and Discussion
with Michael Prince
12:15 p.m. to 1:30 p.m.
Open to Stanford faculty and lecturers
Join Professor Prince and CTL's Director Robyn Dunbar
for informal discussion and Q&A about active learning
and effective practices in STEM teaching.
Teaching Backwards: Using Inductive Teaching
to Promote Conceptual Understanding
2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.
Open to Stanford faculty, lecturers, postdocs, and students
This workshop session introduces "teaching backwards," where
the motivation precedes the content in a learner-centered
approach. You'll have a chance to develop inquiry-based
materials for your own courses.
Dinner and Discussion
with Michael Prince
6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.
Open to Stanford STEM TAs, graduate students, and postdocs
Join Professor Prince and CTL's Director Robyn Dunbar over
dinner and informal conversation on a range of topics. Space is
limited and preference will be given to those who have
participated in at least one of the day's workshops.
Mike Prince is a Professor of Chemical Engineering and Rooke Professor of Engineering at
Bucknell University. He also serves as co-Director of the National Effective Teaching Institute
and "How to Engineer Engineering Education", both well-established workshops that attract
a national audience of engineering faculty each year. He has given over 150 faculty
development workshops to local, national and international audiences. His current research
examines how to repair persistent student misconceptions in the thermal sciences as well as
how to increase the use of research-based instructional strategies by engineering faculty.
