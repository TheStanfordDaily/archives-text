## TALKING 2014 RECRUITS 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
Stanford football has con
tinued to develop the long
term future of its program, by
translating its on-the-field
success to victories on the re
cruiting trail as well, netting
what ESPN ranked as the
15th-best recruiting class in
the nation for "2014.. Although
they have not yet started prac
ticing with the team and will
arrive on campus in about
eight weeks, we thought that it
was never too early to start,
thinking about these newcom
ers. We asked football â– writers
Michael Peterson, Vihan Lak
shman and. David. Cohn:
Which of the freshmen of the
incoming class is primed to
make the biggest, immediate
impact?
Michael: I'm going to go with a
little bit of a lesser-known pick
here. More than likely, it will be dif
ficult for any of Stanford's 2014 re
cruits to see significant time on the
field. Highly-touted recruits Keller
Chryst, Dalton Schultz and
Solomon Thomas would each have
to overcome talent and depth at
their respective positions to crack
the rotation. Even though the race
for the starting tight end job is
technically wide open, Schultz's
current size (233 pounds) and
blocking skills will probably limit
him from being becoming the go-to

Freshman wide receiver Francis Owusu (above) was the only member
of his class to see game action in 2013. He played in 12
games, totaling two receptions for 56 yards and a touchdown, all
of which came in Stanford's 63-13 Big Game victory on Nov. 23.
The members of the new recruiting class will look to follow suit.
