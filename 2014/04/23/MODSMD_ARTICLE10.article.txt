## TALKING 2014 RECRUITS 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
Stanford football has con
tinued to develop the long
term future of its program, by
translating its on-the-field
success to victories on the re
cruiting trail as well, netting
what ESPN ranked as the
15th-best recruiting class in
the nation for "2014.. Although
they have not yet started prac
ticing with the team and will
arrive on campus in about
eight weeks, we thought that it
was never too early to start,
thinking about these newcom
ers. We asked football â– writers
Michael Peterson, Vihan Lak
shman and. David. Cohn:
Which of the freshmen of the
incoming class is primed to
make the biggest, immediate
impact?
Michael: I'm going to go with a
little bit of a lesser-known pick
here. More than likely, it will be dif
ficult for any of Stanford's 2014 re
cruits to see significant time on the
field. Highly-touted recruits Keller
Chryst, Dalton Schultz and
Solomon Thomas would each have
to overcome talent and depth at
their respective positions to crack
the rotation. Even though the race
for the starting tight end job is
technically wide open, Schultz's
current size (233 pounds) and
blocking skills will probably limit
him from being becoming the go-to

Freshman wide receiver Francis Owusu (above) was the only member
of his class to see game action in 2013. He played in 12
games, totaling two receptions for 56 yards and a touchdown, all
of which came in Stanford's 63-13 Big Game victory on Nov. 23.
The members of the new recruiting class will look to follow suit.
guy this early on in his career. But
if a freshman does emerge as a key
contributor, I think it will be defen
sive back Brandon Simmons, the
first recruit to sign in Stanford's
2014 class.
Simmons will certainly need to
add more weight this offseason, as
he currently weighs only 171
pounds. Historically though, head
coach David Shaw has used fresh
men in the secondary if they show
potential. Current sophomore Alex
Carter started in the final seven
games of his true freshman cam
paign and led the team with three
forced fumbles. Junior Wayne
Lyons played the first two games of
his Stanford career as a freshman
before a broken foot ended his sea
son prematurely.
As a Rivals.com four-star re
cruit, Simmons possesses the talent
necessary to earn time in the
Card's secondary. A safety by
trade, Simmons could even com
pete with senior Kyle Olugbode and
junior Kodi Whitfield for time occu
pying Ed Reynolds' vacated free
safety position. If Simmons does
play his freshman year, though, it
might be more likely to come at cor
nerback due to his current size.
I wouldn't claim that Simmons
will become a regular this season
for the Card, but depth in the sec
ondary is always vital and Shaw has
shown that he is willing to allow
freshmen to play there.

David: In all honesty, I do not
believe we will see very many mem
bers of the 2014 recruiting class on
the field this coming season, as the
overwhelming majority of players
will end up redshirting to help them
acclimate to life as a Stanford foot
ball player and a Stanford student
athlete. However, if I had to pick
one player who could play as a true
freshman, I would go with running
back Christian McCaffrey.

While McCaffrey has a very
similar skillset to running back
Kelsey Young, McCaffrey also has
the ability to line up as a slot receiv
er. When I watched McCaffrey
compete in the U.S. Army All-
American Bowl, I saw a player who
can be an extremely physical re
ceiver or running back, as McCaf
frey consistently pushed piles
backward when lined up at half
back.
McCaffrey is also a legacy stu
dent, as his father Ed McCaffrey
was a standout wide receiver and
All-Ameriean for the Cardinal in
the late 1980s and early 19905. Con
sequently, Christian's deeper famil
iarity with the program may give
him a slight advantage over his fel
low incoming freshmen. While it
can be very difficult for freshmen
to initially adapt to the rigorous
demands of elite football and aca
demics, McCaffrey's familiarity
with the Cardinal program may
give him a leg up on these chal
lenges, and in turn, allow him to see
the field in a shorter amount of
time.
Finally, wide receiver has been
one position in the past where
Coach Shaw has been willing to
play freshmen; legacy student
Francis Owusu shined last season in
limited time in his first year on the
Farm. Thus, if McCaffrey can show
some promise when lining up as a
wide receiver, then I believe he will
have a shot to enter the rotation of
talented receivers in 2014.

Vihan: I hate to go all lawyer on
Michael and David, but the prompt
asked, "Which of the freshmen is
primed to make the biggest im
pact," not necessarily who is most
likely to start right away. Looking
at the long-term landscape of the
Stanford football program, I think
(though it's way, way too early to
say) that incoming quarterback
Keller Chryst will be in position to
make the biggest impact out of the
2014 recruiting class.
Playing at the most important
position in football, Chryst will ulti
mately look to have an opportunity

to make an impact with the ball in
his hands on every single play
something that no other member of
the 2014 recruiting class can really
do. With Kevin Hogan entering his
penultimate year of eligibility,
Chryst, one of the top-rated quar
terback prospects in the country,
will have the chance to take the
reins of the Stanford offense early
in his career. Once he arrives on
campus after crossing the street
from Palo Alto High School,
Chryst could also challenge Stan
ford's other quarterbacks in prac
tice and run a strong scout team,
which would provide an immediate
impact for the program. As the
top-rated quarterback prospect to
come to the Farm since Andrew
Luck with arm strength that has al
ready been described as legendary,
Chryst could very well become
Stanford's quarterback of the fu
ture and make a serious impact on
the program.

Michael Peterson, David Cohn and
Vihan Lakshman were all part of
The Daily's legendary 2013 recruit
ing class and all made immediate
impacts with the organization from
the starts of their careers. Tell them,
