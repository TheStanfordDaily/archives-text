# OFFENSE DOES JUST ENOUGH

### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
Stanford baseball's pitching
staff was bailed out by its offense
for a change, as the Cardinal scored
10 runs their most in a 20-game
span dating back to March 4 to

defeat Santa Clara (17-23, 8-7
WCC) 10-9 on Tuesday night.

"Good win for us mid-week. We
scored a lot of runs, but we gave
them a lot of opportunities and
walked a lot of people, which we
don't like," said head coach Mark
Marquess. "But we got some key
hits and played some good defense
no errors again."

The Cardinal (16-17, 6-9 Pac
-12), in their fifth consecutive one
run game, sent out six pitchers af
ter freshman starter Tyler Thorne
got the hook after allowing four
runs over 1.1 innings. With four
games over the next six days, hav
ing the bullpen work a season-high
7.2 innings couldn't have been
what Marquess had in mind to
start the week.
It was a sloppy game pitching
wise for both teams, as they com
bined to surrender 13 walks, seven
hit batsmen and 13 wild pitches.
Stanford's staff accounted for nine
of those walks, two hit batsmen
and seven wild pitches.
Yet freshman Jack Klein led a
strong Stanford offense, picking
up his first career hit and going 3-
for-3 with two walks and three
runs scored. Junior Austin Slater
went 2-for-5 with a triple and two
RBIs and senior Alex Blandino
went 2-for-5 with an RBI and three
runs scored.
Santa Clara got off to a quick 3-
0 lead after freshman Stevie
Berman homered with runners on
the corners and one out in the first
inning. But the Cardinal bats re
sponded quickly, scoring six runs
the most they've scored in an in
