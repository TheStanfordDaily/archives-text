# OFFENSE DOES JUST ENOUGH

### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
Stanford baseball's pitching
staff was bailed out by its offense
for a change, as the Cardinal scored
10 runs their most in a 20-game
span dating back to March 4 to

defeat Santa Clara (17-23, 8-7
WCC) 10-9 on Tuesday night.

"Good win for us mid-week. We
scored a lot of runs, but we gave
them a lot of opportunities and
walked a lot of people, which we
don't like," said head coach Mark
Marquess. "But we got some key
hits and played some good defense
no errors again."

The Cardinal (16-17, 6-9 Pac
-12), in their fifth consecutive one
run game, sent out six pitchers af
ter freshman starter Tyler Thorne
got the hook after allowing four
runs over 1.1 innings. With four
games over the next six days, hav
ing the bullpen work a season-high
7.2 innings couldn't have been
what Marquess had in mind to
start the week.
It was a sloppy game pitching
wise for both teams, as they com
bined to surrender 13 walks, seven
hit batsmen and 13 wild pitches.
Stanford's staff accounted for nine
of those walks, two hit batsmen
and seven wild pitches.
Yet freshman Jack Klein led a
strong Stanford offense, picking
up his first career hit and going 3-
for-3 with two walks and three
runs scored. Junior Austin Slater
went 2-for-5 with a triple and two
RBIs and senior Alex Blandino
went 2-for-5 with an RBI and three
runs scored.
Santa Clara got off to a quick 3-
0 lead after freshman Stevie
Berman homered with runners on
the corners and one out in the first
inning. But the Cardinal bats re
sponded quickly, scoring six runs
the most they've scored in an in

ning since the third game of the
season on Feb. 16 against Rice
on four hits and an error in the top
of the second. They sent 10 hitters
to the plate and were propelled by
an RBI double off the bat of
Blandino and an RBI single from
Slater.
Thorne was chased from the
game in the bottom half of the in
ning after allowing back-to-back
singles, though his replacement,
sophomore Logan James, wasn't
very effective either. James lasted
just 1.2 innings and allowed three
runs on a hit and three walks, with
all of those runs coming in the bot
tom of the fourth as the Broncos
knotted the game at seven.
Stanford regained a one-run
lead in the fifth thanks to an RBI
double from senior Brett Michael
Doran, who went 2-for-5 in the
game. And in the sixth, the advan
tage was stretched to three runs
after Blandino crossed the plate on
a wild pitch and sophomore Drew
Jackson doubled in Klein with two
outs.
The Broncos would cut their
deficit to just one run after scoring
once in the sixth and once in the
seventh off two freshmen each
named Chris—Viall and Castel
lanos. They threatened to tie the

game in the eighth after sopho
more T.J. Braff doubled off Castel
lanos with one out. However, senior
A.J. Yanegas got the call for the
multiple-inning save and was able
to convert the opportunity for his
fifth save of the season.
The Alameda, Calif, native con
tinued his 2014 dominance, getting
the next hitter to fly out and then
striking out the hitter after that to
finish off the eighth. And in the
ninth, Yanegas retired the side af
ter hitting the leadoff man. His 1.2
shutout innings on Tuesday raised
his season total to 20 innings, over
which he has yet to allow an earned
run.
The Cardinal face a quick turn
around, as they will take a drive to
Moraga, Calif, for a 3 p.m. matchup
against St. Mary's this afternoon.
Today's game is a make-up after
the original March 25 contest was
rained out.
It will be the second Stanford-
St. Mary's matchup in two weeks,
as the Gaels visited Sunken Dia
mond last Tuesday in a game re

plete with drama. St. Mary's sent
sophomore Jake Valdez to the
mound in the ninth inning, nursing
a narrow 6-5 lead. After allowing a
leadoff walk to Blandino, Valdez re
tired the next two Cardinal hitters
one out away from securing a
Gaels victory. Yet two pitches later,
sophomore Zach Hoffpauir
smacked a game-tying triple to
right center, paving the way for
senior Danny Diekroeger to deliver
a walk-off single just minutes later.
St. Mary's enters today's
matchup on a season-long 13-game
losing streak, having just dropped
a 3-1 contest to UC-Davis on Tues
day afternoon. Its hitting has fal
tered of late, as the team's season
batting average has dropped to
.257 over the skid Stanford's
pitching staff held the Gaels to just
four hits in last Tuesday's matchup.
Stanford will send out freshman
Brett Hanewich to start the con
test, who hopes to rebound from a
short outing last Thursday against
Arizona State. Hanewich lasted a
season-worst 3.2 innings, allowing
three runs on six hits. Over his last
four starts, he's gone 1-2 with a
6.64 ERA, as opposed to a 0-1
record with a 1.46 ERA over his
first five starts of the season.
The Cardinal, winners of five of
their last six games, will look to re
tain their momentum at Louis
Guisto Stadium at 3 p.m. today.

"Good win for
us mid-week."
MARK MARQUESS,
head coach
Stanford baseball's pitching
staff was bailed out by its offense
for a change, as the Cardinal scored
10 runs their most in a 20-game
span dating back to March 4 to

defeat Santa Clara (17-23, 8-7
WCC) 10-9 on Tuesday night.

"Good win for us mid-week. We
scored a lot of runs, but we gave
them a lot of opportunities and
walked a lot of people, which we
don't like," said head coach Mark
Marquess. "But we got some key
hits and played some good defense
no errors again."

The Cardinal (16-17, 6-9 Pac
-12), in their fifth consecutive one
run game, sent out six pitchers af
ter freshman starter Tyler Thorne
got the hook after allowing four
runs over 1.1 innings. With four
games over the next six days, hav
ing the bullpen work a season-high
7.2 innings couldn't have been
what Marquess had in mind to
start the week.
It was a sloppy game pitching
wise for both teams, as they com
bined to surrender 13 walks, seven
hit batsmen and 13 wild pitches.
Stanford's staff accounted for nine
of those walks, two hit batsmen
and seven wild pitches.
Yet freshman Jack Klein led a
strong Stanford offense, picking
up his first career hit and going 3-
for-3 with two walks and three
runs scored. Junior Austin Slater
went 2-for-5 with a triple and two
RBIs and senior Alex Blandino
went 2-for-5 with an RBI and three
runs scored.
Santa Clara got off to a quick 3-
0 lead after freshman Stevie
Berman homered with runners on
the corners and one out in the first
inning. But the Cardinal bats re
sponded quickly, scoring six runs
the most they've scored in an in

ning since the third game of the
season on Feb. 16 against Rice
on four hits and an error in the top
of the second. They sent 10 hitters
to the plate and were propelled by
an RBI double off the bat of
Blandino and an RBI single from
Slater.
Thorne was chased from the
game in the bottom half of the in
ning after allowing back-to-back
singles, though his replacement,
sophomore Logan James, wasn't
very effective either. James lasted
just 1.2 innings and allowed three
runs on a hit and three walks, with
all of those runs coming in the bot
tom of the fourth as the Broncos
knotted the game at seven.
Stanford regained a one-run
lead in the fifth thanks to an RBI
double from senior Brett Michael
Doran, who went 2-for-5 in the
game. And in the sixth, the advan
tage was stretched to three runs
after Blandino crossed the plate on
a wild pitch and sophomore Drew
Jackson doubled in Klein with two
outs.
The Broncos would cut their
deficit to just one run after scoring
once in the sixth and once in the
seventh off two freshmen each
named Chris—Viall and Castel
lanos. They threatened to tie the

game in the eighth after sopho
more T.J. Braff doubled off Castel
lanos with one out. However, senior
A.J. Yanegas got the call for the
multiple-inning save and was able
to convert the opportunity for his
fifth save of the season.
The Alameda, Calif, native con
tinued his 2014 dominance, getting
the next hitter to fly out and then
striking out the hitter after that to
finish off the eighth. And in the
ninth, Yanegas retired the side af
ter hitting the leadoff man. His 1.2
shutout innings on Tuesday raised
his season total to 20 innings, over
which he has yet to allow an earned
run.
The Cardinal face a quick turn
around, as they will take a drive to
Moraga, Calif, for a 3 p.m. matchup
against St. Mary's this afternoon.
Today's game is a make-up after
the original March 25 contest was
rained out.
It will be the second Stanford-
St. Mary's matchup in two weeks,
as the Gaels visited Sunken Dia
mond last Tuesday in a game re

plete with drama. St. Mary's sent
sophomore Jake Valdez to the
mound in the ninth inning, nursing
a narrow 6-5 lead. After allowing a
leadoff walk to Blandino, Valdez re
tired the next two Cardinal hitters
one out away from securing a
Gaels victory. Yet two pitches later,
sophomore Zach Hoffpauir
smacked a game-tying triple to
right center, paving the way for
senior Danny Diekroeger to deliver
a walk-off single just minutes later.
St. Mary's enters today's
matchup on a season-long 13-game
losing streak, having just dropped
a 3-1 contest to UC-Davis on Tues
day afternoon. Its hitting has fal
tered of late, as the team's season
batting average has dropped to
.257 over the skid Stanford's
pitching staff held the Gaels to just
four hits in last Tuesday's matchup.
Stanford will send out freshman
Brett Hanewich to start the con
test, who hopes to rebound from a
short outing last Thursday against
Arizona State. Hanewich lasted a
season-worst 3.2 innings, allowing
three runs on six hits. Over his last
four starts, he's gone 1-2 with a
6.64 ERA, as opposed to a 0-1
record with a 1.46 ERA over his
first five starts of the season.
The Cardinal, winners of five of
their last six games, will look to re
tain their momentum at Louis
Guisto Stadium at 3 p.m. today.
