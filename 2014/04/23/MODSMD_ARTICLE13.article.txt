much for the tortoise's benefit as
for the handler's: Out in the desert
surrounding Las Vegas, water is a

The harsh environment
shaped by the combination of heat
and lack of water is what makes
the desert tortoise such a secretive

epoxied to its shell) using radio
telemetry, a technique field biolo
gists sometimes use to track
wildlife.
Today, thanks to human-driven
habitat loss, the desert tortoise is
rarer than ever; it is listed as
"Threatened" (just shy of "Endan

For that reason, it finds itself in

group of humans who consider
their lifestyle to be as threatened

The story of Cliven Bundy, a
Nevada farmer currently in a
standoff with the U.S. Bureau of
Land Management, reads like
some kind of anachronistic, anar
chist Wild West showdown to a city
slicker like me.
Bundy has been ranching cattle
for decades on the land surround
ing his family's homestead, 80 miles
from Las Vegas. The thing is, he
hasn't been doing it on his own
land.
Instead, he's been letting his
cattle graze on Federal lands man
aged by the Bureau of Land Man
agement. And, since 1993, he hasn't
been paying the permitting fees to
do so.
According to the BLM, Bundy
has now racked up $1 million in un
paid fees and fines. According to
Bundy, he has been exercising his
unalienable right as a descendant
of Mormon settlers to use land that
the Federal government is trying to
steal out from beneath him.
Frustrated, and certain Bundy
wouldn't change his ways, the BLM
decided to round up and confiscate
his cattle as they grazed (illegally)
on public land.
And that's where things started
to get hairy

said-she-said details, but what it
boils down to is the present-day
armed standoff between Bundy
plus his supporters (apparently,
primarily militiamen and gun
rights lobbyists with ambiguous
agendas) and the Federal govern
ment (for once the voice of order
and reason). Around the time that
the militiamen started saying they

at their front lines so that "it's go

But they can't let this go forev

public lands because of a phenome
non known as the "Tragedy of the

The "tragedy" occurs when a
publicly owned good is degraded by
the use of multiple people acting in
their own individual (short-term)
best interests. Cattle grazing is (lit
erally) the textbook example. Each
individual rancher stands to profit
more if he squeezes a few more an
imals onto the public grazing land.
When each rancher does this, the
public land becomes degraded, of
ten to the extent that it can no
longer support any cattle and
precious little wildlife, for that mat
ter. And because the land is in the
public domain rather than under
the private control of the ranchers
using it, the ranchers have very lit
tle economic stake in maintaining
its health.
In the United States, the vast
majority of grazing land is private

protected from degradation by the
self-interest of its owners. But of
the 245 million acres that the BLM

Theoretically, such a system

public lands to grazing altogether.
Let ranchers own their own land

The story of Cliven Bundy, a
Nevada farmer currently in a
standoff with the U.S. Bureau of
Land Management, reads like
some kind of anachronistic, anar
chist Wild West showdown to a city
slicker like me.
Bundy has been ranching cattle
for decades on the land surround
ing his family's homestead, 80 miles
from Las Vegas. The thing is, he
hasn't been doing it on his own
land.
Instead, he's been letting his
cattle graze on Federal lands man
aged by the Bureau of Land Man
agement. And, since 1993, he hasn't
been paying the permitting fees to
do so.
According to the BLM, Bundy
has now racked up $1 million in un
paid fees and fines. According to
Bundy, he has been exercising his
unalienable right as a descendant
of Mormon settlers to use land that
the Federal government is trying to
steal out from beneath him.
Frustrated, and certain Bundy
wouldn't change his ways, the BLM
decided to round up and confiscate
his cattle as they grazed (illegally)
on public land.
And that's where things started
to get hairy

said-she-said details, but what it
boils down to is the present-day
armed standoff between Bundy
plus his supporters (apparently,
primarily militiamen and gun
rights lobbyists with ambiguous
agendas) and the Federal govern
ment (for once the voice of order
and reason). Around the time that
the militiamen started saying they
planned to put women and children
at their front lines so that "it's go

But they can't let this go forev

public lands because of a phenome
non known as the "Tragedy of the
Commons."
The "tragedy" occurs when a
publicly owned good is degraded by
the use of multiple people acting in
their own individual (short-term)
best interests. Cattle grazing is (lit
erally) the textbook example. Each
individual rancher stands to profit
more if he squeezes a few more an
imals onto the public grazing land.
When each rancher does this, the
public land becomes degraded, of

longer support any cattle and
precious little wildlife, for that mat
ter. And because the land is in the
public domain rather than under
the private control of the ranchers
using it, the ranchers have very lit

its health.
In the United States, the vast
majority of grazing land is private

protected from degradation by the
