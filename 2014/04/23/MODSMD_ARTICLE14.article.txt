# SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY
## In memoriam: Dr. Stephen T Colbert, DFA 
### Vihan Lakshman 
April 10, 2014. That was the
day we learned that we
would soon lose Dr. Stephen
T. Colbert, the esteemed pundit and
host of Comedy Central's The Col
bert Report. This household staple
was given only eight more months
to live crippled by the mysteri
ous, devastating disease known on
ly as The Late Show with David
Letterman.
With his remaining few months
of life, Dr. Colbert plans to continue
his show to deliver "truthiness" to
the American people, but it just
won't be the same. It will be hard to
watch the final episodes of the Re
port, as every twisted irony and
every piece of overt-yet-somehow
still-subtle sarcasm won't produce
laughter so much as a painful re
minder that all good things must
come to an end.
Dr. Colbert and I didn't always
see eye to eye. I agreed with him on
some issues but disagreed with him
on others, and I was always really
jealous of the incredible range of
motion of his eyebrows. Moreover,
I am a native Georgian; Dr. Colbert
reportedly grew up in Charleston,
South Carolina. I have been condi
tioned from a very young age to
hate that cesspool known as
Charleston, South Carolina.
Nevertheless, I find myself wax
ing nostalgic over Colbert's immi
nent death because his show was a
special gem in the wreckage that is
cable television today. People have
praised or criticized the show for
espousing particular ideologies, but
the real heart of The Colbert Re

port had little to do with actual pol
itics it was far more a critique of
modern discourse, where people re
fuse to agree on the facts. And,
more importantly, it shed light on
the complete absurdity of the world
with enough levity to keep us from
going insane.

Colbert's hysterical, slightly
embarrassing interview of my local
Congressman, Jack Kingston
the first of his 435-part-series "Bet
ter Know a District" —under
scores just what we will lose when
that disease known as "Letterman"
finally eats him up. To the face of a
sitting member of Congress, who
expected a serious, traditional in
terview, Colbert peppered
Kingston with uncomfortable ques
tions. Ultimately, after three years
of making politicians squirm, the
series took a hit in content when
then-Democratic Caucus Chairman
Rahm Emanuel instructed Democ
rats not to appear on the show.
Emanuel's message to House
Democrats highlights the other
unique feature of the Report : It ac
tually had the ability, however mi
nor, to effect change. Whether lead
ing a crowd of 50,000 people with
his nemesis, the devious Jon Stew

art, at the "Rally to Restore Fear
and/or Sanity" or starting his own
Super PAC under the guidance of a
salty-ham version of Karl Rove to
expose flaws in campaign finance
laws or even running for President
on more than one occasion, Colbert
had the rare ability to influence
politics and inspire minds, even as
a comparatively lowly television
host. At times, I imagined that he
would follow the path of Robin
Williams in Man of the Year and
actually win the damn thing.
Throughout the process of mak
ing politicians quiver in their boots
or bringing attention to convoluted
laws or the theatrics of cable news,
Colbert always brought a light
hearted sense of humor that made
it easy to feel hopeful in spite of the
ridiculousness manifested every
where one looked.
Incidentally, I thought it might
be worth noting that a guy also
named Stephen Colbert will be tak
ing over for David Letterman at

the end of the year. I have no doubt
that this Mr. Colbert who I hear
possesses extreme mental agility
and a sharp wit will be excellent
in his new role; however, that does
n't make up for the fact that some
thing will still be missing. With the
imminent passing of Dr. Stephen T.
Colbert, DFA, we lose a truly
American voice one that led us
to laugh at ourselves and eat all
beef meats whenever possible.
In the future, I hope more
Stephen Colberts regardless of
their personal political ideologies
can take the stage and bring us
that optimism through humor. But,
in the meantime, we should all re
member to make the extra effort to
laugh at ourselves and the world
around us while staying just a bit
more optimistic about the future.
Dr. Colbert wouldn't want to have
it any other way.

can take the stage and bring us

Dr. Colbert wouldn't want to have

April 10, 2014. That was the
day we learned that we
would soon lose Dr. Stephen
T. Colbert, the esteemed pundit and
host of Comedy Central's The Col
bert Report. This household staple
was given only eight more months
to live crippled by the mysteri
ous, devastating disease known on
ly as The Late Show with David
Letterman.
With his remaining few months
of life, Dr. Colbert plans to continue
his show to deliver "truthiness" to
the American people, but it just
won't be the same. It will be hard to
watch the final episodes of the Re
port, as every twisted irony and
every piece of overt-yet-somehow
still-subtle sarcasm won't produce
laughter so much as a painful re
minder that all good things must
come to an end.
Dr. Colbert and I didn't always
see eye to eye. I agreed with him on
some issues but disagreed with him
on others, and I was always really
jealous of the incredible range of
motion of his eyebrows. Moreover,
I am a native Georgian; Dr. Colbert
reportedly grew up in Charleston,
South Carolina. I have been condi
tioned from a very young age to
hate that cesspool known as
Charleston, South Carolina.
Nevertheless, I find myself wax
ing nostalgic over Colbert's immi
nent death because his show was a
special gem in the wreckage that is
cable television today. People have
praised or criticized the show for
espousing particular ideologies, but
the real heart of The Colbert Re

port had little to do with actual pol
itics it was far more a critique of
modern discourse, where people re
fuse to agree on the facts. And,
more importantly, it shed light on
the complete absurdity of the world
with enough levity to keep us from
going insane.

Colbert's hysterical, slightly
embarrassing interview of my local
Congressman, Jack Kingston
the first of his 435-part-series "Bet
ter Know a District" —under
scores just what we will lose when
that disease known as "Letterman"
finally eats him up. To the face of a
sitting member of Congress, who
expected a serious, traditional in
terview, Colbert peppered
Kingston with uncomfortable ques
tions. Ultimately, after three years
of making politicians squirm, the
series took a hit in content when
then-Democratic Caucus Chairman
Rahm Emanuel instructed Democ
rats not to appear on the show.
Emanuel's message to House
Democrats highlights the other
unique feature of the Report : It ac
tually had the ability, however mi
nor, to effect change. Whether lead
ing a crowd of 50,000 people with
his nemesis, the devious Jon Stew

art, at the "Rally to Restore Fear
and/or Sanity" or starting his own
Super PAC under the guidance of a
salty-ham version of Karl Rove to
expose flaws in campaign finance
laws or even running for President
on more than one occasion, Colbert
had the rare ability to influence
politics and inspire minds, even as
a comparatively lowly television
host. At times, I imagined that he
would follow the path of Robin
Williams in Man of the Year and
actually win the damn thing.
Throughout the process of mak
ing politicians quiver in their boots
or bringing attention to convoluted
laws or the theatrics of cable news,
Colbert always brought a light
hearted sense of humor that made
it easy to feel hopeful in spite of the
ridiculousness manifested every
where one looked.
Incidentally, I thought it might
be worth noting that a guy also
named Stephen Colbert will be tak
ing over for David Letterman at

the end of the year. I have no doubt
that this Mr. Colbert who I hear
