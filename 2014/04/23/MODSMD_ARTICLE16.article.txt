## Moving forward in the Middle East: a two-state solution 
### Gustavo Empinotti 
Over the last month, John Ker
ry's efforts to mediate an
agreement between Israel
and the Palestinian Liberation Or
ganization stalled. Israeli prime
minister Benjamin Netanyahu de
cided not to release the prisoners
he had said he would release. The
chairman of the PLO, Mahmoud
Abbas, had enough of the talks and
sought membership in 15 interna
tional organizations. Netanyahu
considered this a unilateral move
and criticized the PLO for alleged
ly harming the peace process, while
naturally, the PLO sees Israel's re
fusal to release the prisoners as the
real roadblock.
I have no personal connection to
this conflict. I grew up in Brazil in a
culturally Catholic family. Yet, as a
political science major with pro
gressive values, I long for the end
of the occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza and for much-needed
peace in the region.
Unfortunately, I have found it
extremely challenging to debate
this topic on campus. In the left
wing circles I am a part of, I have
seen justified protests against the
occupation turn into an unlimited
attack on Israel and Judaism.
Meanwhile, for a significant part of
the Jewish community, being pro-
Israel means supporting whichever
policies the Israeli government
happens to support, to the point
that it is taboo to bring up the occu
pation at all.
This polarized environment has
led me to J Street U Stanford. J
Street U is the student branch of J
Street, a national organization that
advocates for U.S. leadership for a
two-state solution in the conflict. J
Street U defines itself as Pro-Israel
and Pro-Palestine.
Earlier this quarter, I was at the J
Street U Town Hall, a national con
ference at Johns Hopkins Universi
ty, which was far and away one of
the most amazing environments for
political debate I have ever experi
enced. In a single afternoon, we
heard from Ari Shavit, author of
My Promised Land, a widely
praised history of the State of Is
rael, and Maen Areikat, ambassa
dor of the PLO to the United
States. They were received with

both enthusiasm and some chal
lenging questions. The two of them
have considerably distinct ideolo
gies, and neither fully represents J
Street U. Yet, we were united by
one goal: the end of the occupation
via a two-state solution.
Most importantly, the students
in the conference were anything
but homogeneous. Students new to
the topic and without formed opin
ions were welcome, as were all
sorts of basic questions. In addi
tion, even well-informed students
disagreed on many nuances, such
as the consequences of the idea of a
Jewish state for non-Jewish mi
norities in Israel.
But open debate is not the only
reason I am in J Street U. I am
tired of reading condemnations of
Israel that offer no reasonable solu
tion. After the conference at Johns
Hopkins, J Street U went to Con
gress to show support for House
Resolution 365, a resolution back
ing Kerry's efforts for peace. We
sought a concrete solution and took
real action towards it.
A two-state solution is the only
viable step forward in the conflict.
Some people defend the one-state
concept: a democratic home for
both Israelis and Palestinians. This
is an illusion for two reasons.
First, as Lara Friedman (who
spoke at the conference) put it, "no
Israeli government will dissolve the
State of Israel." Any realistic at
tempt at peace needs to be aware
that both sides will need to make
concessions.
Second, a one-state solution
would deny the mutual recognition
of both peoples, which is a first step
for their reconciliation. If there is
only one state, Jews will see it as
Jewish, and Arabs will see it as
Arab, and they will not coexist in

peace.
Many are disillusioned with the
peace talks. But something differ
ent is happening now, and we
should have hope. Being a pro-Is
rael in Congress no longer means
blindly supporting whatever the
government of Israel does, which is
only reasonable. Senator Ted Cruz
recently declared that Obama is the
most hostile president to Israel in
modern times. The word "hostile"
is of course exaggerated and mis
leading— Israel continues to be
the main American ally in foreign
policy. Cruz simply thinks that the
U.S. should refrain from criticizing
the Israeli government altogether,
in spite of its unacceptable insis
tence on expanding Israeli settle
ments in the West Bank. His dis
comfort actually means that some
thing is changing for the better.
I wrote this column for two rea
sons. First, I hope to see more open
dialogue about this conflict on cam
pus. I hope that those who love Is
rael are able to talk about its prob
lems, and that those that condemn
the occupation are able to distin
guish the government's views from
those of its citizens, including Jew
ish ones. Second, I want to call both
parties whether they be con
cerned primarily about Israeli se
curity or about Palestinian human
rights to take action by chang
ing the discourse on the issue and
building support for a two-state so
lution. Even if you don't know any
thing about the conflict, if you are
interested in any of this, come talk
to us at the Activities Fair this Fri
day, or shoot me an email.

should have hope. Being a pro-Is
rael in Congress no longer means
blindly supporting whatever the
government of Israel does, which is
only reasonable. Senator Ted Cruz
recently declared that Obama is the
most hostile president to Israel in
modern times. The word "hostile"
is of course exaggerated and mis
leading— Israel continues to be
the main American ally in foreign
policy. Cruz simply thinks that the
U.S. should refrain from criticizing
the Israeli government altogether,
in spite of its unacceptable insis
tence on expanding Israeli settle
ments in the West Bank. His dis
comfort actually means that some
thing is changing for the better.
I wrote this column for two rea
sons. First, I hope to see more open
dialogue about this conflict on cam
pus. I hope that those who love Is
rael are able to talk about its prob
lems, and that those that condemn
the occupation are able to distin
guish the government's views from
those of its citizens, including Jew
ish ones. Second, I want to call both
parties whether they be con
cerned primarily about Israeli se
curity or about Palestinian human
rights to take action by chang
ing the discourse on the issue and
building support for a two-state so
lution. Even if you don't know any
thing about the conflict, if you are
interested in any of this, come talk
to us at the Activities Fair this Fri
day, or shoot me an email.

A two-state solution is the only viable
step forward. A one-state democratic
home for both parties is an illusion.
Over the last month, John Ker
ry's efforts to mediate an
agreement between Israel
and the Palestinian Liberation Or
ganization stalled. Israeli prime
minister Benjamin Netanyahu de
cided not to release the prisoners
he had said he would release. The
chairman of the PLO, Mahmoud
Abbas, had enough of the talks and
sought membership in 15 interna
tional organizations. Netanyahu
considered this a unilateral move
and criticized the PLO for alleged
ly harming the peace process, while
naturally, the PLO sees Israel's re
fusal to release the prisoners as the
real roadblock.
I have no personal connection to
this conflict. I grew up in Brazil in a
culturally Catholic family. Yet, as a
political science major with pro
gressive values, I long for the end
of the occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza and for much-needed
peace in the region.
Unfortunately, I have found it
extremely challenging to debate
this topic on campus. In the left
wing circles I am a part of, I have
seen justified protests against the
occupation turn into an unlimited
attack on Israel and Judaism.
Meanwhile, for a significant part of
the Jewish community, being pro-
Israel means supporting whichever
policies the Israeli government
happens to support, to the point
that it is taboo to bring up the occu
pation at all.
This polarized environment has
led me to J Street U Stanford. J
Street U is the student branch of J
Street, a national organization that
advocates for U.S. leadership for a
two-state solution in the conflict. J
Street U defines itself as Pro-Israel
and Pro-Palestine.
Earlier this quarter, I was at the J
Street U Town Hall, a national con
ference at Johns Hopkins Universi
ty, which was far and away one of
the most amazing environments for
political debate I have ever experi
enced. In a single afternoon, we
heard from Ari Shavit, author of
My Promised Land, a widely
praised history of the State of Is
rael, and Maen Areikat, ambassa
dor of the PLO to the United
States. They were received with

both enthusiasm and some chal
lenging questions. The two of them
have considerably distinct ideolo
gies, and neither fully represents J
Street U. Yet, we were united by
one goal: the end of the occupation
via a two-state solution.
Most importantly, the students
in the conference were anything
but homogeneous. Students new to
the topic and without formed opin
ions were welcome, as were all
sorts of basic questions. In addi
tion, even well-informed students
disagreed on many nuances, such
as the consequences of the idea of a
Jewish state for non-Jewish mi
norities in Israel.
But open debate is not the only
reason I am in J Street U. I am
tired of reading condemnations of
Israel that offer no reasonable solu
tion. After the conference at Johns
Hopkins, J Street U went to Con
gress to show support for House
Resolution 365, a resolution back
ing Kerry's efforts for peace. We
sought a concrete solution and took
real action towards it.
A two-state solution is the only
viable step forward in the conflict.
Some people defend the one-state
concept: a democratic home for
both Israelis and Palestinians. This
is an illusion for two reasons.
First, as Lara Friedman (who
spoke at the conference) put it, "no
Israeli government will dissolve the
State of Israel." Any realistic at
tempt at peace needs to be aware
that both sides will need to make
concessions.
Second, a one-state solution
would deny the mutual recognition
of both peoples, which is a first step
for their reconciliation. If there is
only one state, Jews will see it as
Jewish, and Arabs will see it as
Arab, and they will not coexist in

peace.
Many are disillusioned with the
peace talks. But something differ
ent is happening now, and we
should have hope. Being a pro-Is
rael in Congress no longer means
blindly supporting whatever the
government of Israel does, which is
