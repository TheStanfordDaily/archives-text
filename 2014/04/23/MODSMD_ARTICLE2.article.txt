## SUDPS to host drug collection Campus effort to coincide with broader nationwide initiative 
### CALEB SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford University Depart
ment of Public Safety (SUDPS) will
host a collection for over-the-counter
and prescription drugs this Friday and
Saturday. The collection will be free,
anonymous and open to all members of
the public.
The drug collection drive's timing
reflects a broader effort by the Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA)
to collect surplus medical drugs. A
DEA press release estimated that
5,600 collection sites will be open na
tionwide on Saturday, including —in
the local area sites hosted by the
Redwood City, Mountain View and
Fremont police departments.
Vince Bergado, the Stanford drive
coordinator, said that no specific inci
dent had prompted SUDPS' participa
tion in the broader effort. He noted,
however, that SUDPS has received
calls in the past enquiring about the
disposal of medical drugs.
"There aren't a whole lot of oppor
tunities out there [for the safe disposal
of prescription drugs]," Bergado said.
According to the DEA, an estimat
ed 6.8 million Americans abuse pre
scription drugs; in 2010, 22,134 Ameri
cans died from prescription drug over
doses. The disposal of those drugs can
be problematic as well for example,
flushing unused medicine down the
sink presents potentially negative
health effects for fish and other
wildlife.

SUDPS spokesman Bill Larson
emphasized that the drive would help
students avoid the misuse of prescrip
tion drugs.
"It's important for students to
know [that] they have a place to dis
pose [their medication] and hope
fully not give it to someone else," Lar
son said.

Medicines turned in during the
SUDPS collection drive, including med
ical narcotics, will be disposed of safely.
However, the drive will not collect any
injectable medicine, nor the needles or
other medical sharps that accompany
it. Those items can instead be dropped
off at Vaden Health Services.

This weekend's drug collection
drive will be the third time that
SUDPS has participated in drug col
lection drives, with the first two drives
taking place in the spring and winter
of 2013. According to Bergado, ap
proximately 100 people participated in
the last drug collection drive, filling 14
bins with collected drugs in the
process.
