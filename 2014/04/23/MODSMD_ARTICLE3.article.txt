# Dragonboat builds team spirit
## 
### KYLIE JUE DESK EDITOR 
Most people have heard of crew, but few are
familiar with dragonboating, another highly
competitive aquatic team sport. In fact, many
of the Stanford Dragonboat team members
themselves had never heard of the sport before
coming to Stanford.
In a given race, boats usually each have ap
proximately 20 paddlers sitting in pairs, with a
drummer at the front shouting instructions

and one person at the back steering. The Stan
ford team includes 35 members, most of whom
joined the team with little to no prior experi
ence.
David Lam 'l5, who has spent three years
on the team and is currently acting as interim
president, emphasized the team's open policy
for new members. Regardless of their back
grounds, interested students can participate in
a trial period at the beginning of the school
year to see if the sport appeals to them.
"We usually don't have tryouts because

we're a pretty accepting team," Lam said. "For
a lot of people it's their first time ever picking
up a paddle and doing dragonboat."
"Coming to Stanford, I really wanted to
something that was athletic in nature but did
n't require too much of a time commitment like
other club sports," he added.

The Stanford Dragonboat team is joined by a few members from Cal Dragonboat as they paddle out to the start line at the 11th
Annual Arizona Dragonboat Festival. The festival took place at the end of March this year and was the team's third race of the season.
walk-on. Although she did not
know what the sport was at the
time, she explained that she had al
so been looking for a water sport
with a lower commitment.
"I wanted to do some kind of
unique team sport, and I also loved
being on the water," Li said.
With its no-cuts policy, the sport
has created a welcoming communi
ty that has allowed Li to meet peo
ple she never would have other
wise, whether they come from dif
ferent majors or from the graduate
community. Li also emphasized
that the team has made exercising
more enjoyable.
"I found that working out with a
team is way more fun than by your
self, and everyone's really support
ive no matter what level you're at,"
Li said. "Anyone can join Drag
onboat ... It has more to do with
your commitment, and it's more
about how much you improve
rather than the skills that you
have."
The team practices three times

a week: Tuesdays on the track,
Thursdays in the gym and Sundays
on the water at a local estuary in
Redwood City called Bair Island.
Haiyin Wang 'l7, a freshman
with prior experience in water polo,
joined Dragonboat to try a new
sport that would allow him to re
main close to the water. He also ex
plained that the weekly workouts
make the sport an even more dis
tinct experience.
"I really appreciate how it's a
very diverse sport, and the exercise
regimen that comes with it is really
unique," Wang said. "And [spend
ing] Sunday mornings paddling on
the water is really nice and cathar
tic."
According to Lam, practices
take place year-round as the real
Dragonboat season technically falls
in the summer. He also explained
that since most students are not
around in the summer, Stanford's
team misses many of the races that
occur during the actual season.
However, Lam doesn't see this
as detrimental.
"It's just good to get as much
practice as possible because when
we do race, there are very few op
portunities so we want to do our
best at the races we go to," Lam

said. "Our goal isn't necessarily to
win, but [we try] to always improve
on what we've done before and to
make sure that everyone feels that
they gave it their very best."
The team participates in three
or four competitions each year, and
races include various divisions such
as single-gender, mixed-gender
and college-only teams. The team
recently competed in Arizona and
will have their fourth race of the
season at Lake Merced in San
Francisco on May 3.
"We're a very small team and
we're very new so we tend to not do
as well as some of the UC schools,"
Li said. "They have bigger drag
onboat teams, and they tend to be
pretty competitive; we're a lot
smaller, but we're trying to get up
there and be as competitive as
them."
Lam explained that this year
has also seen a transition in the
team's leadership committee. The
core is elected every spring and
splits administrative and logistical
roles such as coordinating which
races the team will attend and
which team members will compete.
"We've been transitioning from
a very one-person-dominated team
to a leadership group of many dif

ferent people, and it's been really
interesting to see that transition
occur," Lam said. "Even though it
hasn't necessarily grown in terms
of the size of the team, [the team]
has definitely grown in terms of the
organization."
According to Lam, this year the
core has focused on building a com
munity and on making sure team
members feel they have done the
best they can.
"I've gotten a lot of workouts in,
made a lot of good friends, gone to
pretty cool places with reduced
cost," Lam said. "It's also taught
me to be a more responsible per
son."
Li also spoke about the team's
emphasis on improvement rather
than winning.
"It's all about the team and the
boat as a whole ... but you feel like
you're a necessary part of the team
as well," Li said. "It really encour
ages you to feel this connection
with the rest of the boat."
"The feeling of competing and
going as fast as you can is very ex
citing and rewarding even if you
don't win," she added.
