# Dragonboat builds team spirit
## 
### KYLIE JUE DESK EDITOR 
Most people have heard of crew, but few are
familiar with dragonboating, another highly
competitive aquatic team sport. In fact, many
of the Stanford Dragonboat team members
themselves had never heard of the sport before
coming to Stanford.
In a given race, boats usually each have ap
proximately 20 paddlers sitting in pairs, with a
drummer at the front shouting instructions

and one person at the back steering. The Stan
ford team includes 35 members, most of whom
joined the team with little to no prior experi
ence.
David Lam 'l5, who has spent three years
on the team and is currently acting as interim
president, emphasized the team's open policy
for new members. Regardless of their back
grounds, interested students can participate in
a trial period at the beginning of the school
year to see if the sport appeals to them.
"We usually don't have tryouts because

we're a pretty accepting team," Lam said. "For
a lot of people it's their first time ever picking
up a paddle and doing dragonboat."
"Coming to Stanford, I really wanted to
something that was athletic in nature but did
n't require too much of a time commitment like
other club sports," he added.

The Stanford Dragonboat team is joined by a few members from Cal Dragonboat as they paddle out to the start line at the 11th
Annual Arizona Dragonboat Festival. The festival took place at the end of March this year and was the team's third race of the season.
