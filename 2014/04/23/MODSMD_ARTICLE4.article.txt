# Q&A LISA JACKSON
## ADMINISTRATOR OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 
### VICTOR XU STAFF WRITER 
Lisa Jackson, administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) from 2009-2013, spoke to stu
dents yesterday evening about her life
in both the public and private sectors.
The talk was the second annual Steven
H. Schneider Memorial Lecture, and
was held in Memorial Auditorium.
Before her lecture, The Daily spoke
with Jackson who currently serves
as Vice President of Environmental
Initiatives at Apple about her
tenure at the EPA, her time at Apple
and the future of energy in the United
States.

Lisa Jackson gave the second annual Steven H.
Schneider Memorial Lecture on Wednesday in
Memorial Auditorium. Jackson was the administrator of
the Environmental Protection Agency from 2009-2013.
growing energy independence
spurred by renewables and a do
mestic fossil fuel boom. Is this
good or bad for America's energy
future?
LJ: First of all, I think the caus
es [of increasing energy independ
ence] are myriad. We saw a decline
in the amount of oil and gas used
because of the recession, and when
the economy slows down, the
amount of energy that businesses
use often slows down. We also saw
a doubling of fuel economy stan
dards in the first Obama Adminis
tration ... But I think from the
standpoint of energy and the mix of
energy, it's not surprising that in
any transition ... that you're going
to see some of those energy forms
phase out.
So your question was whether
it's good or bad, I think it's normal,
it's expected. But, hopefully we see
businesses like Apple that lead and
say, hey we can do this. We can run
a business, we can run a data cen
ter, we can run a manufacturing
site on renewable energy.

TSD: Apple now powers its facili

ties and data centers through al
most exclusively renewable ener
gy, but a large portion of Apple's
carbon footprint is in manufac
turing and consumer product
use. What's being done to ad
dress this side of the company's
energy policies?
LJ: Apple does a really detailed
and thorough carbon footprinting.
We call it a lifecycle analysis. You're
absolutely right, the thing that
makes it innovative is when we start
making one of our products. We
track the aluminum, for example, all
the way back to the mine. We know
the footprint of that aluminum and
we include it in our carbon footprint,
even though we don't own the mine,
we don't own the smelter, we don't
own any of those processes.
We believe that by tracking it we
can then drive to something better.
If you look at that carbon footprint,
the largest part is definitely in the
manufacturing and supply chain,
and the second largest is actually
the use of our products by the peo
ple who own them. So we track and
take charge of the footprint of your
use, this iPhone for example. So we
can reduce our carbon footprint by
reducing your use.

TSD: You were one of the first
EPA administrators to have been
a career scientist, but you had to

deal with huge administrative
crises like the Gulf oil spill. How
has being a trained scientist
helped you as EPA administrator
and in your current position at
Apple?
LJ: Absolutely. I'm a chemical
engineer by training, with a mas
ter's degree. It's not like you sit
down [and stop using scientific
skills] when you're managing a
large organization. The EPA has
17,000 people. It's a huge organiza
tion with amazing scale and scope.
You use the managing skills you
have, certainly, as you begin to
manage people, but you also use
the problem solving skills. Engi
neers are trained as problem
solvers [and] scientists are trained
in the scientific method.
I think for us at the EPA, most
people don't realize how incredibly
complex the science of protecting
the environment has become. Air
modeling to look at air pollution is
pretty complex stuff. Or, the moni
toring systems that we use have
evolved to the point that they're
very compact but also very precise.
Or, cleaning up a contaminated
aquifer requires lots of technical
skills... I always thought it was a
particular help not only that I was a
scientist but that I had been for 20
years working for the EPA and al
most 22 years working for the envi

ronmental field before I became
administrator.
TSD: What can a student at Stan
ford do to improve America's en
ergy future?
LJ: Learn. The key to environ
mental protection increasingly is
innovation. What I thought and
continue to believe in progress is
innovation people who take the
challenges that frankly have been
around for decades and some new
ones and say I don't see that chal
lenge as something we just have to
deal with, I see it as an opportuni
ty. [lt's] an opportunity to make
money, an opportunity to start my

own business.
I think obviously Stanford has
done an amazing job of teaching
folks everything from green design
to sustainability to system oriented
thinking, the idea of how to create
value for your business while creat
ing value for the environment and
society as a whole. As students,
what Stanford excels at is teaching
you that kind of thinking. When
you get out, you can bring with you
all that innovation, creativity and
probably a measure of experience
to solve those challenges.
