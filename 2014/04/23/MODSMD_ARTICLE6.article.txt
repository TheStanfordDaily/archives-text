## Senate talks emergency funding Body discusses SASA grant at its penultimate meeting 
### PETER MOON DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
The penultimate meeting of the 15th
ASSU Undergraduate Senate focused
principally on the continuation of last
week's discussion of a measure to pro
vide the Stanford African Students As
sociation (SASA) with emergency fund
ing following the group's failure to ob
tain special fees funding.
After making minor adjustments to
the bill under discussion, Senator John-
Lancaster Finley 'l6 sought to clarify
that the measure will not serve as a
precedent for all future groups that fail
to win joint special fees funding.
According to Elections Commission
er Hunter Kodama 'l4, SASA's request
garnered the support of a majority of
both undergraduate and graduate stu
dents but fell short of being voted on by
15 percent of the combined student
populations.

However, a few senators empha
sized the value of specifying which
groups should be deemed valuable to
students.

"It's important we point out these
three [cultural, religious and sexual]
groups because they no doubt add cul
tural value to the school," said Senator
Hisham Al-Falih 'l6. "Other groups
should receive votes from the students
to receive funding."
Finley replied that the Senate need
ed to maintain the lack of specificity be
cause of the potential for a future group
that lies outside those groupings to add
significant value.
"We need to give [a] future Senate
the power to decide," Finley said.
After further discussion, the bill
passed the Senate. SASA will receive a
$lO,OOO grant from the 16th Under
graduate Senate.
The Senate also discussed eight new
bills that were on previous notice, all of
which will be voted on in the last meet
ing of the 15th Undergraduate Senate.
The most important of the eight bills
involved an "Emergency Buffer
Fund Bailout of General Fees."
Authored by Senate Chair Ben
Holston'ls, the bill effectively de
scribes the current general fees
situation as an "emergency" and
allows the use of a buffer fund to
financially support general fees
groups through spring quarter.
ASSU Financial Manager and
CEO of Stanford Student Enter

prises (SSE) Neveen Mahmoud
'll criticized the measure as
detrimental to the future of AS
SU.
"This is not an emergency situ
ation," Mahmoud said. "Spending
112 percent over what you were
allocated to spend is not the solu
tion to this problem."
Mahmoud also noted the po
tentially detrimental precedent of
using buffer funds to resolve ex
cessive expenditures. The buffer
fund, which is composed of money
that is returned to the Senate
every year, has no exact specifica
tions as to how it is to be spent.
"This will perpetuate the mind
set that [using buffer fund money to
fund general fees] is ok and in five
years all the money will be gone,"
Mahmoud said. "You are saying that
it is ok to do things that students did
not give you permission to do."
Mahmoud also clarified that
groups aren't automatically entitled
to the $6,000 in funding allowed
each general fees group.
"Not having money left in gener
al fees fund is what it is, it's not an
emergency situation," said Assis
tant ASSU Financial
Manager Stephen Trusheim 'l3
M.S. 'l4. "We've done what we can
do to support groups; continuing
spending money is not how to stop
overspending money."
The Senate concluded by post
poning this bill until next week.
Other bills discussed included a
bill to confirm Justine Moore 'l6
and Olivia Moore 'l6 as ASSU As
sistant Financial Managers, replac
ing Trusheim; a bill to approve the
fiscal year 2015 ASSU Operating
Budget and a bill to approve the col
lection, disbursement and refund
schedule of undergraduate and
graduate student fees for fiscal year
2014.
