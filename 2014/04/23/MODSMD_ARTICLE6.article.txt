## Senate talks emergency funding Body discusses SASA grant at its penultimate meeting 
### PETER MOON DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
The penultimate meeting of the 15th
ASSU Undergraduate Senate focused
principally on the continuation of last
week's discussion of a measure to pro
vide the Stanford African Students As
sociation (SASA) with emergency fund
ing following the group's failure to ob
tain special fees funding.
After making minor adjustments to
the bill under discussion, Senator John-
Lancaster Finley 'l6 sought to clarify
that the measure will not serve as a
precedent for all future groups that fail
to win joint special fees funding.
According to Elections Commission
er Hunter Kodama 'l4, SASA's request
garnered the support of a majority of
both undergraduate and graduate stu
dents but fell short of being voted on by
15 percent of the combined student
populations.

However, a few senators empha
sized the value of specifying which
groups should be deemed valuable to
students.

"It's important we point out these
three [cultural, religious and sexual]
groups because they no doubt add cul
tural value to the school," said Senator
Hisham Al-Falih 'l6. "Other groups
should receive votes from the students
to receive funding."
Finley replied that the Senate need
ed to maintain the lack of specificity be
cause of the potential for a future group
that lies outside those groupings to add
significant value.
"We need to give [a] future Senate
the power to decide," Finley said.
After further discussion, the bill
passed the Senate. SASA will receive a
$lO,OOO grant from the 16th Under
graduate Senate.
The Senate also discussed eight new
bills that were on previous notice, all of
which will be voted on in the last meet
ing of the 15th Undergraduate Senate.
