## Scholarships don't count as compensation 
### Cameron Miller 
A few weeks ago, in the
aftermath of UConn's
victory over Kentucky
in the national champi
onship game, I wrote a
piece decrying the blatant unfairness
of the NCAAs revenue model and its
rules governing its so-called "stu
dent-athletes." I hesitate to even use
the latter term, as it just further en
grains the belief that all collegians are
students first and that their contribu
tions to their universities' athletic
programs are a secondary priority.
That is the NCAAs goal: to cement
the "amateur" status of its players,
when in reality those individuals
particularly in revenue-rich sports
such as football and men's basketball
are nothing but cash cows.
I want to delve into one of the issues
—that a scholarship is not compensa
tion and thus cannot be counted as re
muneration from institution to player
—that I raised in that column, and
flesh it out more thoroughly.
An athletic scholarship is essential
ly grant-in-aid that allows individual to
attend a university at no or a reduced
cost. This aid is awarded on the basis of
the individual's ability to contribute to
his or her team and can fluctuate year
ly depending on his or her perform
ance. But rather than go into the ath
letes' own pockets, the scholarship
money goes directly into the universi
ty's coffers, which then allows the indi
vidual to attend class and fulfill NCAA
academic eligibility requirements.
Thus, when a program enters into a
scholarship agreement with a player,
the player is signing a contract stipulat
ing that he or she will compete for the
program, and in return "have the priv
ilege of" enrolling in degree-applicable
units—which is necessary to be an el
igible collegiate athlete at a reduced
price.
Let me present an analogous situa
tion to make this explanation more
palatable. Let us say that a law firm
hires a new attorney But in order to be
eligible to try his or her cases, the at
torney is forced by the firm to attend
continuing education classes. These
classes, albeit expensive, allow the
lawyer to refresh and expand his or her
knowledge of the existing laws and le
gal precedents that are key to the suc
cessful resolution of the cases current
ly before the firm. However, instead of
paying the attorney through commis
sion or on an hourly basis, the firm de
cides the only compensation it will pro
vide to the attorney is covering the
amount of the continuing education
courses. In this way, the lawyer is basi
cally working for free, since the classes
are necessary to even attempt to con
test their suits.
Is this situation not unfair? Is it not
unjust to require something that allows
an employee to perform his or her job
and then turn around and only com
pensate the individual by paying for
the completion of that "something?"
What about remuneration for the per
formance of their actual duties?
There are many similarities be
tween the example I have very rough
ly sketched and the situation a seg
ment of collegiate athletes find them
selves in: denied even a sliver of the
ever-increasing profits—from ticket
sales, corporate sponsorships, apparel
contracts their hard work and the
efforts of their predecessors ultimately
secured.
Without their tireless work during
the week, Stanford's football players
simply wouldn't be able to present a
competitive show that puts people in
seats with ridiculously overpriced bev
erages in hand on Saturdays.
If not for countless hours spent
studying film or training on the prac
tice court or strengthening in the
weight room, there's no way Chasson
Randle and company could've made
the Sweet 16 —resulting in invaluable
brand exposure for Stanford Athletics
and the University as a whole.
I can see the rebuttals from acade
mia and the general public coming
from a mile away: aren't revenue-sport
athletes still students first? Isn't their
overall objective to earn a degree, not
simply use collegiate athletics as a de
facto development league before they
jump ship to the pros? Isn't the value of
an education reward enough?
These are admittedly tough ques
tions, not easily answerable and cer
tainly not generalizable across a large
population of athletes.
But ask yourself: Do the NCAA
or member institutions view these in
dividuals first and foremost as stu
dents or employees, given their
unique ability to generate huge prof
its for both entities?
