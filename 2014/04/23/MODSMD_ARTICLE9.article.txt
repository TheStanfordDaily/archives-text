# PAC-ING THE HEAT
## CARD SPURRED BY HOT STREAK 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
No. 27 Stanford men's tennis
(14-4, 5-2 Pac-12) will look to con
tinue riding the hot streak on
which it ended its season when it
takes to the courts in Ojai, Calif,
to kick off the Pac-12 Champi
onships on Thursday before it
likely earns a berth in the NCAA
Tournament.
The Cardinal, having climbed
10 spots in the rankings after a 4-
2 win over rival No. 16 Cal over
the weekend to cap their regular
season, will enter the tournament
as the third seed, earning a first
round bye past the initial round
of matches of Wednesday as a re
sult.
Stanford will ride an encour
aging five-match winning streak
into the postseason, including
wins over ranked opponents,
then-No. 39 Oregon and Cal. And
although more is at stake in the
tournament, head coach John
Whitlinger isn't looking to treat
the upcoming tournament match

es any differently than he would
regular-season matches.
"You say that it's just another
match, but obviously it's a tour
nament," Whitlinger said. "You
try not to make it a big deal; it is
another match that you've just
got to get four points in... keep
everything as normal as possible.
You just get the guys to the right
point. You don't want to over-rev
them up. Trust that what you've
been doing in practice makes you
ready to play those matches."
The late-season resurgence
came after a tough weekend in
southern California in which the
Cardinal were swept by then-No.
2 USC and then-No. 3 UCLA in
back-to-back matches, which
snapped a season-high six-match
win streak that included a trio of
tough 4-3 road victories.
In doing so, Stanford rocket
ed up the national rankings, ris
ing 25 spots from its spot on
April 1 to the end of the season.
In addition, after having been a

bubble NCAA Tournament
team for the majority of the
season, the strong ending to
the season has made the
Cardinal almost certain to
be named to the national
tournament in late May.
Stanford's doubles play
leaves room for improve
ment as it moves into the
tournament. Due to injuries
on the roster and inconsis
tencies in the lineups as a re
sult, Stanford has dropped
10 doubles points this sea
son despite having lost just
four matches. Although
strong singles play has
helped bail the Cardinal out,
Whitlinger identified the in
consistent play to open
matches as a concern mov
ing forward.
"As you get into tourna
ments, that doubles point is
gigantic," Whitlinger said.
"You only have to win three
singles matches instead of
four... [our guys have] been
able to step up to the plate
and come through in singles,

but it's always nicer to get
that first point and move on
from there."
In its first round of tour
nament play on Thursday,
Stanford will face the win
ner of Wednesday's match
between No. 6 Washington
and No. 7 Oregon. Although
the Cardinal were undefeat
ed in matches against both
the Huskies and Ducks this
season, the second match
against Washington certain
ly didn't come easily, with
Stanford needing last-sec
ond heroics from sophomore
Anthony Tsodikov to clinch
a narrow 4-3 win.
Oregon will enter the
matchup against Washing
ton having lost seven of its
last eight matches, including
a 4-3 defeat to Washington
in the teams' regular-season
finale. It was a disappoint
ing ending to what looked to
be a promising season for a
Ducks team that started the
season 13-1. Meanwhile,
Washington will also enter
the match against Oregon
having dropped three of its
last four matches, meaning
that regardless of who wins
that first-round matchup,
Stanford will play an oppo

nent that has been strug
gling as of late, while the
Cardinal themselves are
playing their best tennis
right now, especially coming
off of an emotional win
against rival Cal.
Heading into the tourna
ment, two Stanford players
have jumped into the nation
al singles rankings, with
sophomore Maciek Ro
manowicz ranked No. 69 in
the nation while junior John
Morrissey, who has been
playing at number-one sin
gles for the Cardinal,
jumped to No. 103.
The winner of the sec
ond-round matchup be
tween Stanford and its op
ponent will move on to face
second-seeded UCLA,
which has dominated Pac-12
play outside of a tough loss
to USC to close out its regu
lar season, earning a double
bye directly to the semifi
nals of the conference tour
nament.

The matchup between
Stanford and the winner of
Washington and Oregon will
start at 2 p.m. on Thursday.
