### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
No. 27 Stanford men's tennis
(14-4, 5-2 Pac-12) will look to con
tinue riding the hot streak on
which it ended its season when it
takes to the courts in Ojai, Calif,
to kick off the Pac-12 Champi
onships on Thursday before it
likely earns a berth in the NCAA
Tournament.
The Cardinal, having climbed
10 spots in the rankings after a 4-
2 win over rival No. 16 Cal over
the weekend to cap their regular
season, will enter the tournament
as the third seed, earning a first
round bye past the initial round
of matches of Wednesday as a re

Stanford will ride an encour
aging five-match winning streak
into the postseason, including
wins over ranked opponents,
then-No. 39 Oregon and Cal. And
although more is at stake in the
tournament, head coach John
Whitlinger isn't looking to treat
the upcoming tournament match

es any differently than he would
regular-season matches.
"You say that it's just another
match, but obviously it's a tour
nament," Whitlinger said. "You
try not to make it a big deal; it is
another match that you've just
got to get four points in... keep
everything as normal as possible.
You just get the guys to the right
point. You don't want to over-rev
them up. Trust that what you've
been doing in practice makes you
ready to play those matches."
The late-season resurgence
came after a tough weekend in
southern California in which the
Cardinal were swept by then-No.
2 USC and then-No. 3 UCLA in
back-to-back matches, which
snapped a season-high six-match
win streak that included a trio of
tough 4-3 road victories.
In doing so, Stanford rocket
ed up the national rankings, ris
ing 25 spots from its spot on
April 1 to the end of the season.
