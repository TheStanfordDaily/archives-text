Stanford Kenpo Karate Club
presents the Annual Women's
Self-Defense Workshop!
An introduction to basic techniques for self defense and
awareness in a safe and supportive group environment.
Practice full force self defense on
actual people. Our club members put
on protective gear and let participants
really hit them. You will experience
what a real life situation is like, and
learn that you have the strength to
fight back.
