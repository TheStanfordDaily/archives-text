### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
The hot bat of junior Alex Blandino
and strong relief pitching from sopho
more Marcus Brakeman powered Stan
ford baseball to a win as the Card
jumped ahead early and led the whole
way in a 6-2 victory over Saint Mary's
(13-27, 5-10 WCC). The win moved
Stanford (17-17,6-9 Pac-12) back to .500
for the first time since March 28, when
they stood at 10-10, and was the Cardi
nal's sixth victory in their last seven
games.
"The mindset of the team the last
few games is just that it's been all of us
[contributing]," Brakeman said.
"Everyone's going out there and attack
ing the other team, really wanting to
win. It means a lot getting back to .500."
The Cardinal offense finished with
nine total hits, including two hits apiece
from Blandino, junior Austin Slater,
sophomore Zach Hoffpauir and fresh
man Tommy Edman, but it was Blandi
no who stole the show. Blandino finished
the game 2-for-4 with two home runs,

four RBIs and three runs for his third
career two-homer game. Over his past
three games, Blandino is 5-for-12 with
six total runs scored as well.
Blandino's two home runs give Stan
ford nine total homers in its last 16
games; the Cardinal had only five home
runs in its first 18 games.
Freshman Brett Hanewich took the
mound to start the game for Stanford
but struggled with his command in 3.1
innings pitched. Despite only surren
dering two hits, the Bradenton, Fla. na
tive issued three walks and hit two bat
ters. Over his past four starts,
Hanewich is now 0-2 with a 6.62 ERA in
17.2 innings pitched.
Brakeman impressed pitching in re
lief of Hanewich, throwing 5.2 innings
and holding the Gaels scoreless. In addi
tion, Brakeman allowed just five
baserunners while striking out seven to
pick up his first win of the season.
"I got more used to throwing all my
pitches as the game went on," Brake
man said. "Everything definitely clicked
