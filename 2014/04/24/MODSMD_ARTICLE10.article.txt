# STANFORD GOUGES GAELS
## BLANDINO HITS TWO HOMERS IN WIN OVER SMC 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
The hot bat of junior Alex Blandino
and strong relief pitching from sopho
more Marcus Brakeman powered Stan
ford baseball to a win as the Card
jumped ahead early and led the whole
way in a 6-2 victory over Saint Mary's
(13-27, 5-10 WCC). The win moved
Stanford (17-17,6-9 Pac-12) back to .500
for the first time since March 28, when
they stood at 10-10, and was the Cardi
nal's sixth victory in their last seven
games.
"The mindset of the team the last
few games is just that it's been all of us
[contributing]," Brakeman said.
"Everyone's going out there and attack
ing the other team, really wanting to
win. It means a lot getting back to .500."
The Cardinal offense finished with
nine total hits, including two hits apiece
from Blandino, junior Austin Slater,
sophomore Zach Hoffpauir and fresh
man Tommy Edman, but it was Blandi
no who stole the show. Blandino finished
the game 2-for-4 with two home runs,

four RBIs and three runs for his third
career two-homer game. Over his past
three games, Blandino is 5-for-12 with
six total runs scored as well.
Blandino's two home runs give Stan
ford nine total homers in its last 16
games; the Cardinal had only five home
runs in its first 18 games.
Freshman Brett Hanewich took the
mound to start the game for Stanford
but struggled with his command in 3.1
innings pitched. Despite only surren
dering two hits, the Bradenton, Fla. na
tive issued three walks and hit two bat
ters. Over his past four starts,
Hanewich is now 0-2 with a 6.62 ERA in
17.2 innings pitched.
Brakeman impressed pitching in re
lief of Hanewich, throwing 5.2 innings
and holding the Gaels scoreless. In addi
tion, Brakeman allowed just five
baserunners while striking out seven to
pick up his first win of the season.
"I got more used to throwing all my
pitches as the game went on," Brake
man said. "Everything definitely clicked

by the seventh or eighth in
ning."
The game started off well
for the Cardinal, as Edman
and freshman Jack Klein
both reached base to lead off
the game before a sacrifice
bunt from senior Danny
Diekroeger moved them into
scoring position. The bunt
ultimately proved meaning
less when Blandino blasted
the ball over the left field
fence to put Stanford ahead
3-0 in the first frame.
The teams would trade
barbs in the middle innings,
as the Gaels pushed a run
across in the second inning
to cut the lead to 3-1. But
Stanford responded quickly
in the third when Blandino
scored on a wild pitch. In the
fourth inning, an RBI single
from DonAndre Clark

trimmed Stanford's lead
again, this time to 4-2. A solo
home run from Blandino in
the fifth inning and a run
from sophomore Drew Jack
son on a passed ball in the
sixth increased Stanford's
advantage to 6-2, which it
maintained until the finish.
For Saint Mary's, the
loss was its 14th straight,
and its second loss in that
stretch to the Cardinal. Just
over a week ago, Stanford
defeated the Gaels in a
come-from-behind win that
saw Mark Marquess' unit
win 7-6 on a walk-off single
from Diekroeger. Saint
Mary's continues to spiral
downwards after starting
the season 13-13.
There will be little rest
for the Cardinal who have
played five games in the last
six days as they take on
Cal in a three-game series
starting this Friday.

Freshman Brett Hanewich took the
mound to start the game for Stanford
but struggled with his command in 3.1
innings pitched. Despite only surren
dering two hits, the Bradenton, Fla. na
tive issued three walks and hit two bat
ters. Over his past four starts,
Hanewich is now 0-2 with a 6.62 ERA in
17.2 innings pitched.
Brakeman impressed pitching in re
lief of Hanewich, throwing 5.2 innings
and holding the Gaels scoreless. In addi
tion, Brakeman allowed just five
baserunners while striking out seven to
pick up his first win of the season.
"I got more used to throwing all my
pitches as the game went on," Brake
man said. "Everything definitely clicked

Junior third baseman Alex Blandino (above) launched two home runs in Wendesday's
game against Saint Mary's, powering the Cardinal to the 6-2 win over
the Gaels. Blandino is now 5-1 2 with six runs scored in his last three games.
by the seventh or eighth in
ning."
The game started off well
for the Cardinal, as Edman
and freshman Jack Klein
both reached base to lead off
the game before a sacrifice
bunt from senior Danny
Diekroeger moved them into
scoring position. The bunt
ultimately proved meaning
less when Blandino blasted
the ball over the left field
fence to put Stanford ahead
3-0 in the first frame.
The teams would trade
barbs in the middle innings,
as the Gaels pushed a run
across in the second inning
to cut the lead to 3-1. But
Stanford responded quickly
in the third when Blandino
scored on a wild pitch. In the
fourth inning, an RBI single
from DonAndre Clark

trimmed Stanford's lead
again, this time to 4-2. A solo
home run from Blandino in
the fifth inning and a run
from sophomore Drew Jack
son on a passed ball in the
sixth increased Stanford's
advantage to 6-2, which it
maintained until the finish.
For Saint Mary's, the
loss was its 14th straight,
and its second loss in that
stretch to the Cardinal. Just
over a week ago, Stanford
defeated the Gaels in a
come-from-behind win that
saw Mark Marquess' unit
win 7-6 on a walk-off single
from Diekroeger. Saint
Mary's continues to spiral
downwards after starting
the season 13-13.
There will be little rest
for the Cardinal who have
played five games in the last
six days as they take on
Cal in a three-game series
starting this Friday.
