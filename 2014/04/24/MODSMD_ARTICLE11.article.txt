## Stanford faces Cal in regular season finale 
### CARLIE TENENBAUM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the final game of its 2014 regular
season, the Stanford women's lacrosse
team will battle archrival California (5-
10, 3-5 MPSF), aiming to rebound from
a very tough 11-10 loss to USC on Sun
day. Despite the setback, the squad is
still in contention for the second seed in
the upcoming MPSF playoffs. On the
heels of disappointment, it will be cru
cial that the Cardinal (12-3, 6-2) show
resilience and perseverance two
traits that will serve them well if they
hope to make a deep postseason run.
"We have to face every game from
now on as if it's the championship game,
and we're prepared to do so," said sen-

ior Anna Kim. "Just like oth
er teams across the nation,
anyone can win on any given
day sometimes it matters
who wants it more."
As a midfielder, Kim un
derstands the importance of
transitions of momentum; if
Stanford ever needed a shift
in its direction, the time is
now.
In a classic rivalry game,
there is sure to be no short
age of emotion in Thursday's
match. However, it is impor
tant that Stanford stays
grounded in the fundamen
tals and honed in on its keys
to success.

"They haven't had the
strongest season this year,
but one of our main strate

gies is not underestimating
them," said junior Lucy
Dikeou.
Dikeou has been an of
fensive powerhouse this sea
son, with 26 goals to her
name. She and the rest of
the Cardinal offense will
need to be focused and driv
en to keep pace with a good
Cal team. This matchup will
be the first of the season for
the cross-bay rivals, and a
win would be critical for
Stanford's momentum going
into the playoffs. Despite
her individual prowess,
Dikeou realizes that only a
true team effort will result in
a victory for the Card.
"A balance of individually
holding ourselves to a higher
standard while also relying
on our teammates to mesh
well together [is the key],"
Dikeou said.
Not only will emotions be
running high due to the ri
valry, but today is also Sen
ior Night for Amy Bokker's
squad. Thus, aside from
seeking momentum heading
into the postseason, Stan
ford will also look to send its
five seniors out with a win in
their final home match.
"There are not as many
opportunities to play
lacrosse as there are for oth
er NCAA sports post-col
lege," Kim said. "As a senior,
I have to leave everything on
the field."
Though it is extra special
to end the regular season
against Cal, the team is fo
cused on using this game to
get back in the zone and pre
pare for the postseason.
The old mantra "defense
wins championships" is not
lost on this Stanford team,
whose defensive front is an
chored by senior Megan
Lerner.
"I'm really excited to play
against Cal," Lerner said.
"I'm pumped to get a win
and go into the postseason
on a positive note. The
biggest key is being able to
come out strong at the first
whistle and be able to keep
that energy going for the en
tire game."
And while the seniors' sin
gular focus is winning their
final home game, they were
also able to take a step back
and reflect on their years as
Stanford lacrosse players.
"Being able to turn the
program into a national
powerhouse and having two
consecutive seasons where
we're ranked in the top 10,"
Lerner said of the biggest
surprise of her collegiate ca
reer. "I credit my coaches
for helping us prove that
Stanford lacrosse is just as
good as East Coast
lacrosse."
Kim was quick to credit
her teammates, and left
them with a piece of advice
for the future.
"Keep getting better each
day, because the country has
yet to see the full potential of
Stanford lacrosse," she said.
It will certainly be excit
ing to see what the future
both immediate and long
term holds, especially
with the MPSF Tournament
looming. But Stanford must
tackle the task at hand one
match at a time, starting
with the Bears this Thurs
day at 4 p.m.
