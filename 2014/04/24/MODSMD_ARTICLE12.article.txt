## OUTSIDE THE BUBBLE No "U" in Colombia? 
### James Bradbury 
He may have left the office hi
2010, but ex-president Al
varo Uribe remains the ele
phant in the room of contemporary
Colombian politics. One of George
W Bush's closest international al
lies, he presided over the twin
"Colombian Miracles" of the 2000s:
rapid investment-driven economic
growth, and the military defeat of
both drug traffickers and the Revo
lutionary Armed Forces of Colom
bia (FARC) Marxist guerrilla group.
Uribe's program of "democratic
security" aimed to restore govern
ment control over Colombia. He
called for vastly increased defense
spending and the active assertion of
Colombian government sovereignty
in rural areas that had previously
been under the tacit control of
FARC or drug lords. Along with
policies aimed at shoring up "invest
ment confidence" and "social cohe
sion," and a majoritarian principle
opposed to Colombia's historic
legalism that Uribe called the
"state of opinion," this program
formed the backbone of his pop
ulist, statist brand of conservatism.
That so-called Uribismo quick
ly upended the Colombian political
environment, previously character
ized by a relatively stable opposi
tion between the Liberal Party and
the Conservative Party. Although
Uribe was subject to term limits,
popular support for his policies
his approval ratings were regularly
upwards of 70 percent led sever
al factions to unite around their
common support for a constitution
al amendment that would allow a
second Uribe term; this "U Party"
won more votes in the 2006 legisla
tive elections than either of the tra
ditional parties.
Even though in 2009 the Consti
tutional Court ruled out the possi
bility of yet another re-election bid,
the future of Uribismo still looked
secure, for President Uribe had
picked out a seemingly perfect suc
cessor. Juan Manuel Santos had
founded and led the U Party and,
as defense minister, had overseen
the implementation of Uribe's "de
mocratic security" policies and the
war against FARC and the cartels.
Running under the banner of a
party named for President Uribe,
and as a cabinet member linked
more closely than anyone else to the
President's security policies, Santos
campaigned for and won the 2010
elections as a loyal Uribista. But
halfway through his term, Presi
dent Santos marshaled his unques
tionable conservative credentials
into the Colombian equivalent of a
"Nixon to China" moment: He an
nounced peace talks with the FARC
militants, to be held in and mediat
ed by Fidel Castro's Cuba.
Uribe denounced this decision
repeatedly from his wildly popular
Twitter account, and within a few
months the men who were once pa
tron and protege became bitter po
litical enemies. Uribe left the U Par
ty to found the Democratic Center
party (one that was poorly named;
in reality, it was well to the right of
the conservative establishment);
with that party he contested and
won a Senate seat in this past
March's legislative elections.
But besides Santos himself, a
candidate from Uribe's new party, a
representative of the socialist left
and a Conservative Party candidate
who has tried to stay relatively neu
tral in the Santos-Uribe fight, there
is yet a fifth major player in next
month's presidential vote. The
country's capital of Bogota, abas

tion of opposition to Uribe's presi
dency, has also been a breeding
ground for a new kind of urban pol
itics.
Beginning in the 19905, a succes
sion of leftist mayors transformed
Bogota as deeply and as successful
ly as Uribe had transformed the na
tion in the 2000s: Enrique Penalosa
alone, mayor for only three years,
embarked on five hugely popular
megaprojects including the most
comprehensive and successful bike
path and bus rapid transit networks
in the entire developing world.
Two of these mayors joined
forces for the 2014 presidential elec
tions, using the Green Party as a po
litical vehicle; they selected
Penalosa as a candidate and are cur
rently polling second behind Presi
dent Santos.
The race is so complex and wide
open because, in attempting to nav
igate a relatively centrist path,
President Santos has ticked off both
the Colombian left and right.
A scandal surrounding the De
cember dismissal of Bogota's cur
rent mayor for allegedly breaking
the law by nationalizing the city's
garbage collection (Santos agreed
yesterday to reinstate him) made
many progressives contend that he
wanted to exclude the core of the
Colombian left former guerillas
like that mayor from politics en
tirely. Uribe, for his part, continues
to criticize the FARC peace talks as
"negotiation with terrorists." Polls
suggest that 70 percent of Colom
bians would rather not see Santos
re-elected.
But Penalosa's Green Alliance
candidacy is still a relatively long
shot, and Uribe and the rest of
Colombia's conservatives could still
close ranks around Santos in the
election's second round (though
Penalosa actually received an unex
pected, and probably unhelpful,
Uribe endorsement in his failed
2011 attempt at regaining the may
orship). Indeed, Uribe's candidate,
Oscar Zuluaga, could yet claim sec
ond place, leading to a second
round election that would look like a
Republican Party primary, and
would surely generate more than a
few criticisms of the two-round elec
toral system.
But at least one recent poll has
Penalosa defeating Santos in a
runoff. If that's accurate, the up
start center-left economist-mayor
will have won because the modern
Colombian right, the most powerful
in the western hemisphere, is split
by the very man whose presidency
made it so strong. Progressivism
has been in retreat in Colombia (rel
ative to its success in the rest of
Latin America) because it is seen as
the intellectual loser of the multi
decade civil war; this would be an
unexpected twist of fate. And so
perhaps progressivism in Colombia,
"condemned," like the late Gabriel
Garcia Marquez wrote, "to one hun
dred years of solitude" because of a
legacy of Marxism and violence,
"will have, at last and forever, a sec
ond opportunity on Earth."
