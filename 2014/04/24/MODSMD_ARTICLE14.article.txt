# Brogramming and the women-in-tech question
## 
### Stephany Yong 
Why there aren't more
women in tech? The public
enjoys asking this ques
tion, while the business and tech
writers at Forbes love answering it
with articles that often lead with
the headline, "Ten Reasons Why
Women ... " and similarly influ
enced op-eds about glass ceilings
(with the obligatory Lean In ref
erence).
I find the question about getting
more women in technology an in
teresting and relevant one. Harvey
Mudd's President, Maria Klawe of
fered an explanation: "We've done
lots of research on why young
women don't choose tech careers,
and number one is they think it's
not interesting. Number two, they
think they wouldn't be good at it.
Number three, they think they will
be working with a number of people
that they just wouldn't feel com
fortable or happy working along
side."
Klawe's findings are just one of
many attempts to answer the
women-in-tech question. Several

articles cite surveys that find girls
are avoiding tech careers osten
sibly because we're shallow and
afraid of the stereotype affiliations
of being socially awkward, or we're
singularly focused on computers, or
we're physically unattractive. How
ever, I find the female vanity expla
nation out of touch with the reality
of what I've experienced as a fe
male undergrad interested in pur
suing a career in technology.
I want to explore the women in
tech question by not mulling over
the causes of the problem (i.e. that
girls play with Barbies while guys
play with Legos), but instead by
discussing some of the things I've
observed as a Stanford student
about that very phenomenon.
Over the course of two years, I
have been lucky enough to hear the
stories of talented women working
in many facets of tech as engineers,
product managers, venture capital
ists and even startup CEOs. Yet re
gardless of the pace or size of the
talk, there is one question that
someone in the crowd inevitably
asks: "How's the work-life balance,
managing your priorities in your
professional and personal life?" I
cringe whenever I hear this. Before
us is an exceptional leader who
has accomplished incredible
things in her career, and you're
going to shift the focus of her
presentation by asking her how
she's able to "do it all'*!

While I think the work-life ques
tion is a very valid one, and some
thing I've definitely thought about, I
cannot recall a time I have ever
heard a moderator or audience
member ask a man that. This ques
tion is indicative of the wary mind
set women have about male-domi
nated industries, technology being
first and foremost among them.
With that in mind, I think we can
avoid questions like this by celebrat
ing women already in technology,
since people naturally like to "see"
themselves in a job before pursuing
it.

Of course, we do have female role
models such as Marissa Mayer and
Sheryl Sandberg sitting in C-level
suites in the Valley. However, public
interest in these figures has focused
on not only their professional
achievements, but also their work
life balance that undeniably stems
from the fact that they are women.
But by emphasizing that they're the

exceptions, not the rule, this seem
ingly singular fascination that has
turned them into icons has also inad
vertently shrouded them (who I
want to note are also older and far
ther along in their careers) in an air
of unattainability.
In spite of the diversity on cam
pus, it's easy to decipher Stanford's
archetypical dorm room startup
founder: a Caucasian (and on occa
sion, Asian) male engineer. With the
rise of the "brogrammer," who (usu
ally) collaborates with male peers on
projects and ventures, many VCs
use what they call "pattern match
ing" to identify good founders; un
surprisingly, pattern matching
tends to favor preexisting patterns
(i.e. the male Stanford startup
founder). Since venture funding is
so critical to a company getting off
the ground, this self-perpetuating
problem of the "archetypal founder"
creates a barrier to entry (that is
both real and imagined) for women
breaking into the Silicon Valley boys
club.
The question I originally posed is
easy to answer after all, we can
point to a myriad of studies, testimo
nials and editorials as to why people
think girls are underrepresented in
tech. Figuring what we should do to
address the issue is a separate topic.
Although there is no panacea for
this problem, we engage in more
meaningful, thorough discussions
when we work with girls who are ex
periencing these issues firsthand,
instead of a middle-aged magazine
columnist who can only speculate.
Building off the work of organi
zations like Girls Who Code and
she+ + that encourage girls to pur
sue their interests in STEM fields, I
think that the next proactive steps
would be to celebrate female tech
nologists working across the indus
try in different capacities, as op
posed the Sandbergs of the world
that grace the cover of ForbesWe
can get more female leaders lead
ing engineering sprints and signing
term sheets by deemphasizing
"brogrammer" culture, and creat
ing an inclusive, merit-based
ecosystem where women feel like
they belong and have an equal
stake in the Valley.
