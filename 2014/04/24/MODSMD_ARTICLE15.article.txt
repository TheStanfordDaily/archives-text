# SPORTS BRIEF
## Stanford to host USA Rugby National Championship Series this weekend 
### â€“ Do-Hyoung Park 
Several of the nation's top
collegiate rugby teams will
gather this weekend on the
Farm as Stanford will host
the Western Regional of the
USA Rugby National Cham
pionship Series this week
end, with the Sweet 16 and
Elite Eight matchups of
Men's Division IAA, Women's
Division 1 and Women's Divi
sion 2 postseason play tak
ing place at Steuber Rugby
Stadium.
Both the men's and
women's team will kick off
their postseasons on their
home turf, with the men look
ing to make the most of a
bounceback season in which
it won its conference during
its first season at the IAA
level. Meanwhile, the women
will look to sustain the great
success that they have en
joyed over the last several
seasons. The women's team
played in seven of the eight
national title games between
2005 and 2012 before an un
timely early exit in last year's
draw.

The men will kick off their
playoffs against Oregon on
Saturday after having ripped
through the Pacific Western
Conference to the tune of a 6-
0 conference record and an 8-
3-1 overall record after fac
ing tough out-of-conference
competition. It was a tremen
dous bounceback season for
the men, which experienced
doubts in dropping from the
Division 1A level after a win
less 2013 campaign but found
its move validated by the suc
cess that has rejuvenated the
program this year.
Meanwhile, the women's
team will face Texas A&M in
their first match on Friday
and will likely be the fa
vorites to win after a fantas
tic 5-0 run through its confer
ence schedule, with a tough
matchup against the winner
between BYU and Cal await
ing them in the Elite Eight
game on Sunday.
The events for the nation
al playoffs will kick off with
the Stanford-Texas A&M
women's match on Friday at
5 p.m. The men will start
their postseason on Saturday
at 1 p.m.
