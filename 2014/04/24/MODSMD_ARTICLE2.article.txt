## Three grad students win Hertz funding Science students will receive support for graduate studies 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
Three Stanford graduate students
have been named as 2014 Hertz Fel
lows, an award that grants recipients a
stipend and full tuition support for up
to five years of graduate study in the
applied physical, biological and engi
neering sciences.
According to Katherine Young, chief
operations officer of the Hertz Founda
tion, the three students William
Allen, a first-year doctoral student in
neuroscience; Emily Davis, a first-year
doctoral student in physics; and Emma
Pierson 'l3 M.S. 'l3, a computer science
researcher beat out close to 800 ap
plicants to receive the fellowship, which
was awarded to a total of 15 students.
In addition to supporting recipi
ents financially, the Foundation also
aims to build a network amongst se
lected students.
"We have an orientation where we
bring in all 15 students and introduce
them to other fellows from other
schools," Young said. "This creates re
lationships across disciplines and even
across generations, because fellows
from past years come back as well."
The Daily sat down with Allen,
Davis and Pierson to discuss their re
search, educational plans and thoughts
on being awarded the fellowship.

Allen did re
search as an under
graduate at UCSF,
studying gene regu
lation dining neural
development in mice
and using DNA se
quence technology
to figure out how

genes turn on and off. Specifically, he
focused on how long-lasting changes to
DNA make a cell turn into a more spe
cialized cell.
Allen, who subsequently pursued a
master's degree at University of Cam
bridge as a Churchill Scholar, praised
the freedom that the fellowship's fund
ing will give him.
"Usually for Ph.D.'s, you're funded
for the first year and then the second
and third year you're funded by your
department... but with Hertz, at no
point the person you're working for has
to be paying for you or have influence
over what you research," Allen said.

Currently a stu
dent in the physics
department, Davis is
building a new atom
ic physics experi
ment in an effort to
develop a new gen
eration of precision
sensors, and ex-

pressed interest in working on precision
measurement and quantum metrology
in particular. Davis has also worked on
finding different applications for the
development of new instrumentation
and measurement tools for a wide vari
ety of fields.
Davis also acknowledged the less
ened constraints on research due to the
fellowship.
"In general, [the fellowship] gives you
more flexibility, lets you explore new ar
eas and increases your influence in the
fields you're working in," Davis said.

After her under
graduate experi
ence at Stanford,
Pierson worked as
a statistician at
23andMe and Cours
era. A Rhodes Schol
ar and recipient of
the Deans' Award,

Pierson worked on using statistics to
solve problems in a variety of fields in
cluding astrology, psychology and bio
computation.
