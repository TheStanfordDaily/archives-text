# Frats engage student interests
## Special interest fraternities offer students professional, social communities 
### IRENE HSU DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
At Stanford, approximately 13 per
cent of undergraduate students are
part of Greek life. This includes fra
ternities and sororities associated with the
Inter-Fraternity Council and Inter-Sorori
ty Council, as well as those associated with
the African-American Fraternal and Soro
ral Association, and the Multicultural
Greek Council.
Beyond that, however, some students
are associated with special interest frater
nities. These range from professional fra
ternities, such as Alpha Delta Phi and Al
pha Kappa Psi, to service fraternities, such
as Alpha Phi Omega. They also have differ
ent focuses, such as Alpha Chi Sigma's em
phasis on chemistry or Alpha Delta Phi's fo
cus on literature.
To take a better look at the different
special interest fraternities on campus, The
Daily sat down with officers from three dif
ferent fraternities: Alpha Chi Sigma, Alpha
Phi Omega and Alpha Delta Phi.
Alpha Chi Sigma
Founded in 1916 on Stanford's campus,
Alpha Chi Sigma is a professional fraterni
ty centered on chemistry. While it was de
activated in 1981 because of dying interest,
the fraternity became a colony under the
Sigma Chapter at UC-Berkeley. In 2012, it
was reactivated on campus and this year
saw a rush class of 26 recruits, adding to an
existing brotherhood of 30 members.
"While we strive to create a brother
hood and create a more cohesive chemistry
community, we also strive to create a com
munity with the Chemistry Department,"
said Nai Saephanh 'l5, who is Vice Master
Alchemist, or vice president, of Alpha Chi
Sigma.
Members do not have to be chemistry
majors, but one of the few requirements to
rush Alpha Chi Sigma is a legitimate inter
est in chemistry.
The fraternity hosts faculty dinners
with members of the chemistry department
as part of this mission. It also provides pro
fessional development events for resume
building and for tips on interviews. One of
