# Frats engage student interests
## Special interest fraternities offer students professional, social communities 
### IRENE HSU DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
At Stanford, approximately 13 per
cent of undergraduate students are
part of Greek life. This includes fra
ternities and sororities associated with the
Inter-Fraternity Council and Inter-Sorori
ty Council, as well as those associated with
the African-American Fraternal and Soro
ral Association, and the Multicultural
Greek Council.
Beyond that, however, some students
are associated with special interest frater
nities. These range from professional fra
ternities, such as Alpha Delta Phi and Al
pha Kappa Psi, to service fraternities, such
as Alpha Phi Omega. They also have differ
ent focuses, such as Alpha Chi Sigma's em
phasis on chemistry or Alpha Delta Phi's fo
cus on literature.
To take a better look at the different
special interest fraternities on campus, The
Daily sat down with officers from three dif
ferent fraternities: Alpha Chi Sigma, Alpha
Phi Omega and Alpha Delta Phi.
Alpha Chi Sigma
Founded in 1916 on Stanford's campus,
Alpha Chi Sigma is a professional fraterni
ty centered on chemistry. While it was de
activated in 1981 because of dying interest,
the fraternity became a colony under the
Sigma Chapter at UC-Berkeley. In 2012, it
was reactivated on campus and this year
saw a rush class of 26 recruits, adding to an
existing brotherhood of 30 members.
"While we strive to create a brother
hood and create a more cohesive chemistry
community, we also strive to create a com
munity with the Chemistry Department,"
said Nai Saephanh 'l5, who is Vice Master
Alchemist, or vice president, of Alpha Chi
Sigma.
Members do not have to be chemistry
majors, but one of the few requirements to
rush Alpha Chi Sigma is a legitimate inter
est in chemistry.
The fraternity hosts faculty dinners
with members of the chemistry department
as part of this mission. It also provides pro
fessional development events for resume
building and for tips on interviews. One of

the brothers, Darren Handiko 'l6, is
currently working on a consulting
group to link the brothers to busi
nesses.
In addition to these events, the
brothers frequently work on prob
lem sets with each other, and have
also provided support for students
coming out of chemistry exams.
"Our aim in forming this frat was
to provide a platform for brothers
who are always seeing each other in
these classes to get to know each
other," Saephanh said.
Alpha Phi Omega
Alpha Phi Omega is a national
service fraternity whose Zeta Chap
ter was founded at Stanford in 1928.
The fraternity partners with or
ganizations such as Save the Bay,
which focuses on environmental
clean up in the Bay Area. It also
hosts events like a cleanup of the
Dish hiking trail planned for today

or the Hunger and Homelessness
Charity Auction, which is co-spon
sored with organizations such as
Challah for Hunger and Night Out
reach.
"The types of people who join
APhiO aren't just public service
minded, but are also looking to build
social bonds," said Alex Mullin 'l5,
co-president of Alpha Phi Omega.
"It's the intersection of these two
things that creates a group that is
very welcoming and fun to be
around."
Alpha Phi Omega does not use
the bid process, meaning that near
ly all students who want to join the
"rush" and "pledge" process are al
lowed to join. This, according to
Mullin, is an attempt to diversify the
group's membership. The "pledge"
process includes creating a service
project, as well as getting to know
the brothers of the fraternity.

Alpha Delta Phi
Initially founded as a literary
fraternity, Alpha Delta Phi subse
quently became co-educational and
eventually transitioned into a liter
ary society in 1989.

"It has become an outlet for peo
ple passionate about literature and
humanities, something that is some
times of secondary interest on cam
pus," said Cody Laux 'l5, Madam
President, or president, of Alpha
Delta Phi.
Like Alpha Chi Sigma, Alpha
Delta Phi went through a hiatus on
campus. It was revived in 2008 and
has since seen renewed interest.
This year, the society saw a record
number of "neophytes," or new
members approximately 30,
more than the amount of active
members in the organization.
While Alpha Delta Phi lost its
housing in 1989, it has only
strengthened the bonds of the
brothers, according to Laux.
"Because it's not housed, we
have more of a focus for coming to
gether for literature rather than
just being a community of people

who live together," she said.
Alpha Delta Phi hosts several
events for both members and non
members, such Novel in a Night,
when members sign up for 10 min
utes each of reading out loud to
complete a book in one night, and
Poem In Your Pocket Day on April
24, which is when members keep po
ems in then- pockets to trade with
other members. Alpha Delta Phi
also hosts the annual Laker Music
Festival on May 31 at the Enchant
ed Broccoli Forest.
"Our members are photogra
phers, engineers, philosophers,
writers, humanities people, hard sci
ence people a whole spectrum,"
Laux said. "It's amazing that we can
all come together over something as
simple as poetry.
