## ASSU dedicates colorful week to emotional well-being 'Feel the Rainbow' campaign aims to boost issue awareness 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
The ASSU launched a "Feel
the Rainbow" campaign earlier
this week, in an effort to raise
awareness about emotional well
being among students at Stan
ford.
The campaign, which started

on Monday and which will contin
ue through Friday, features a
small activity booth in White
Plaza that focuses on a different
emotion every day.
According to Ellora Israni 'l4,
a member of the ASSU Execu
tive Cabinet, she and fellow Cab
inet member Nina Church 'l6
started the project towards the
beginning of the academic year
out of their own interest.
"We were basically given the
freedom to pick an issue on cam

pus that we cared about, and we
both wanted to address the idea
of emotional well-being on cam
pus," Israni said. "Emotional
well-being came up a lot on cam
pus, like in the duck syndrome, so
we wanted to do something about
it."

Israni described the duck syn
drome as a tendency that Stan
ford students have to repress
emotion and not give themselves
the time to address the senti
ments that they are feeling.

"I think that the basis of it all
is that we're busy and that we're
doing a million things and we're
happy doing a million things,
looking like we're doing great all
the time," Israni said. "If we ac
tually give ourselves time to
spend on how we're feeling, we'll
be better off in the long run."
To address the issue, Israni
and Church sought to provide
students with an emotional out
let. They formed a team of stu
dents from various backgrounds
in order to help them decide the
content for the week, structuring
it in such away that every day fea
tured a different emotion.
Selina Her 'l7, part of the
team, explained that the concept
of the rainbow represented the
spectrum of emotions that the
campaign encourages students to
explore within themselves.
"We wanted to emphasize the
idea that it's normal to feel a
range of emotions, and it's okay to
express them if you're comfort
able with expressing them," Her
said.
The activities are designed to
be low-commitment and require
little time.
"For example: Monday was
anger, and we had bubble wrap for
people to come by and pop," Israni
explained. "Thursday is gratitude
and we're having people decorate
cookies and give it someone that
they are grateful for. These are
things you can do as you're pass
ing through, just to have it as a re
minder to stop and think and ad
dress your emotions."
Beyond receiving funding from
ASSU Executives Dan Ashton 'l4

and Billy Gallagher 'l4, Israni not
ed the campaign also received
support from many different cam
pus organizations, including the
d.school, the Bridge Peer Counsel
ing Center, Vaden Health Center
and the Happiness Collective.
In addition to the week of activ
ities, the campaign will conclude
with public visual art, where stu
dents will be invited to help create a
collage of "hopes" or "wishes," ac
cording to Her.
"We were thinking of a cumula
tive idea that could wrap up the
week's activities," she said. "So we
decided that hope was a good emo
tion to finish up with, and the [visu
al art] will make a nice public dis
play. Different people are going to
be contributing, and it'll be another
outlet for emotional wellbeing."
The campaign's team expressed
interest in continuing the initiative
in the future and supporting a
healthier cycle of mental health.
"We want to take what we're do
ing and package that, have it be
something that the incoming fresh
man class gets when they arrive to
campus," Israni said. "Ultimately
what we're trying to do is not small
activities, but raise awareness
around emotional well-being and ex
pression. If we can do that now, then
we have that in the front of minds of
freshmen coming in next fall."
