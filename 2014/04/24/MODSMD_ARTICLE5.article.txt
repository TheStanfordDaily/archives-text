# CRUNCH TIME FOR CARD
## STANFORD TO BEGIN NCAA TITLE DEFENSE IN OJAI 
### FIONA NOONAN STAFF WRITER 
After a tough 6-1 loss to No. 4 California (18-4,10-0
Pac-12) on Senior Day last weekend, the No. 9 Stanford
women's tennis team (16-2, 8-2 Pac-12) will have one
more chance to reclaim its place atop the conference at
the Pac-12 Championships starting today.
The tournament takes place as part of the 114 th An
nual Ojai Valley Tournament, which also includes profes
sional non-collegiate athletes and the men's Pac-12
Championships.

Freshman Carol Zhao (above) will play in both the singles and doubles matches of
the Pac-12 Championships. The native Canadian has enjoyed notable success in
the doubles discipline, winning the 2013 Junior Australian Open event.
Unlike the rest of the sea
son, the championships are
set up as matches between in
dividuals rather than
matchups between two
schools' teams. There are
doubles and singles tourna
ments, as well as an invita
tional tournament for players
who have not been selected
by their schools to play in the
championship portion of the
overall tournament.
32 singles players and 16
doubles pairs have been se
lected to the championships,
with representatives from
each of the 11 Pac-12 schools
fielding a women's tennis pro
gram— Oregon State does
not currently have a varsity
team.

Stanford will send four of
its singles players to compete
in the main draw in Ojai: No.
54 sophomore Rrista Harde
beck, No. 49 junior Ellen Tsay,
No. 40 freshman Taylor
Davidson, and No. 23 fresh
man Carol Zhao.
All four players narrowly
lost their singles matches to
Cal last Saturday, but if they
play as they have for the ma
jority of the season, Stanford
could very well repeat its tour
nament success from last year,
when Hardebeck made it all
the way to the championship
match.
Zhao, in her first Pac-12
tournament, will have a tall or
der if she wants to make a run
into the latter stages of the
tournament. UCLAs Jennifer
Brady, USC's Zoe Scandalis,
and Cal's Anett Schutting,
who was just named the Pac
12 Player of the Week, all fig
ure to pose tough challenges
to their competition.
That said, until last week,
Zhao had won 16 in a row—
and she could very well repeat
Hardebeck's success as a
freshman.
On the doubles side, the
No. 9-ranked duo of senior
Rristie Ahn and Zhao, and the
No. 38-ranked Davidson/Tsay
pair, will represent the Cardi
nal. Ahn, who will be rested
during the main singles draw,
should be fresh and fired up
for the doubles matches, in

which the pair is ranked sec
ond in the draw. Zhao and Ahn
lost for the first time in confer
ence play against the Bears,
and should be ready to come
out with a vengeance in Ojai
For their part, Davidson
and Tsay have been strong all
year, reaching match point
against Cal last weekend be
fore the match was aban
doned. They are seeded fourth
in the doubles draw, and will
also be a force to be reckoned
with in the coming days.
The invitational portion of
the tournament will give No.
52 freshman Caroline Doyle
more quality match play be
fore the postseason, and could
even result in a rematch
against Cal's Maegan Man
asse, who clinched last week
end's win with a victory over
Doyle. The invitational side
will also provide senior Amelia
Herring and sophomore Lind
sey Kostas with valuable court
time after a season in which
neither of them made it into
the rotation to a significant ex
tent.
After the Cal match, head
coach Lele Forood, in her 14th
year at Stanford, said that the
women will need to clean up
their play going into the Pac
12s in order to prepare for the
NCAA Tournament beyond.
"Everybody needs to con
tinue to work on either closing
out matches or doing the
things we didn't get quite done
[against Cal]," Forood said.
"We've got to be a little sharp
er in the doubles."
Given that Stanford has
been the image of perfection
almost all season, the team
knows what it needs to do to
win, and certainly has the
drive to get there behind the
leadership of Tsay, Hardebeck
and Ahn.
Of course, an individual
win at the Pac-12s would only
be the beginning for the Car
dinal in the postseason. The
real prize is the NCAA Tour
nament, which will begin with
the round of 64 at Stanford on
Friday, May 9.
"Obviously, as a team, the
goal is always to win NCAAs,"
said Ahn, who will be playing
her last NCAA Tournament
as a member of the Cardinal.
She will likely go on to play
professional tennis.
"To end on a good note
would be perfect," she added.
The Cardinal begin match
play today in Ojai, Calif.
