## ProFros should be ambassadors for athletics 
### Do-Hyoung Park 
Welcome to the
Farm, Class of
2018! By all ac
counts, you've got
one unforgettable,
hectic, sleepless, action-packed week
end ahead of you. Unfortunately, it
doesn't look like you'll be able to go
fountain hopping because of the
drought, but you'll make new Mends,
meet the people you'll likely be spend
ing the next four years of your life
with, explore an unfamiliar campus
and finally be able to put a face to
those people whose sole purpose in
life seems to be posting in the ad
mitted class' Facebook group.
I know that most of you got into
Stanford because you've focused on
your academics and extracurricu
lars in a seemingly never-ending
pursuit to catch the attention of
your admissions officers. Speaking
frankly, a 5.07 percent admit rate is
absolutely ludicrous. I certainly
know that I wouldn't have gotten in
under this year's admissions stan
dards.
Through all of the craziness,
though, I ask you one thing for this
weekend that you have on campus:
Try to set aside some time to make
it out to a Stanford sports game,
whether it's lacrosse facing off
against Cal tonight, baseball taking
on Cal in a three-game series at
Sunken Diamond or softball host
ing No. 1 Oregon at Smith Family
Stadium for a weekend set.
Stanford is a campus at which
excellence is clearly visible every
day, from the hundreds of freshmen
working late into the night on prob
lem sets or papers to the faculty
that work tirelessly to conduct re
search for which they have a pas
sion. But something that I feel is of
ten unjustly overlooked is how the
excellence carries through to the
athletic department.

Raise your hand if coming into
Stanford, you're aware that this
university is home to the top athlet
ic program in the nation.
Now, I bet not too many of you
have your hands up right now. And
that's exactly the misconception that
I know the athletes and administra
tors on this campus are working tire
lessly to break. They're really doing
all they can; Stanford has won 19
consecutive Directors' Cups (award
ed to the top overall athletic pro
gram in the country) and is comfort
ably ahead in the race for its 20th.
Men's basketball made a miraculous
run to the Sweet 16, while football
qualified for its fourth consecutive
BCS bowl. Soccer, water polo, tennis,
volleyball and women's basketball
are perennial threats to win national
championships.
Yet, the conception of Stanford
as a purely academic school —no
doubt fueled in part by the contin
ued regression of the admit rate
and the continued excellence in the
research from its academic depart
ments pervades society today.
Even within discussions in the
realm of sports, be it on ESPN or
countless online forums, when
Stanford's athletic programs are
mentioned, it's only a matter of
time before somebody comments
on the midterms that the athletes
are studying for or the classes that
they must be skipping god for
bid to play these matches.
Sure, some of the athletes have
embraced that mantra. The athletic
department unveiled its new
#NerdNation identity and really
flaunted it throughout the football
and women's basketball seasons.
Newly minted No. 1 WNBA Draft
selection Chiney Ogwumike even
made a "N-E-R-D-S" music video,
and took the image of the athletic
nerd as her own.
While I admire the athletes'
willingness to embrace that image,
I don't necessarily know if it's good
for a program that's really bursting
onto the forefront of the national
scene with sustained success in the
"major" sports. I think that what
the #NerdNation image has done

Excellence
carries through
to the athletic
department.

is extend the reach of the al
ready-overwhelming sphere
of academic success and ex
panded it into the space of
what should also be an over
whelming sphere of athletic
success.
I think that such an im
age portrays Stanford as an
academic school that is also
really good at sports. I really
don't like that. Stanford is
just as much an athletic
school as it is an academic
school perhaps even more
so. While Stanford's brand of
academic excellence is
clumped together with that
of several other schools in
the country (see: "Harvard
of the West"), Stanford's
brand of athletic excellence
is truly unparalleled in the
nation. And the sad part is,
very few people outside of
this campus and quite a
few people on this campus
don't see that.
How do we change this?
Well, Class of 2018, it
starts with you.
I'm sure you'll meet some
athletes at Admit Weekend,
but your first taste of what
the student-athlete lifestyle
is like will truly come when

you move in during the end
of September and perhaps
live next door to an Olympic
gold medalist or a starter on
the baseball team. You'll see
how much of their lives, their
time and their identity they
give to their teams in the
gritty, often-thankless pur
suit of again putting Stan
ford at the top of the nation
in athletics. You'll get rolled
out by your RA and the rest
of your dorm to go see them
compete, and you'll have a
much more vested interest
in the success of the pro
grams here because of that
(hopefully).
But this weekend, you
can get the ball rolling by go
ing out to support the per
sonalities that you'll grow to
know and love during your
eventual undergraduate ca
reer here. You can get a taste
of the culture of athletic ex
cellence that pervades this
campus, and you can be part
of the effort to advance that
to a national stage by giving
them your support. Start to
take an active role in convey
ing their stories and their
successes to your friends
and family back home.
Because really, at the end
of the day, the scope of what
the athletes can do to build
Stanford as an athletic pow
erhouse in the eyes of the na
tion as a whole starts and

stops on the field, the court,
the diamond or the mat. It's
really up to you to be their
ambassadors.

Do-Hyoung Park is -prepar
ing for the raging tide- of
prospective freshmen whip
persnappers with lots of

youthful energy on campus
by preparing a disaster kit
and retiring to a hut in
Yosemite for the weekend.
Tell him that he's getting old
and it's time to retire at
dparko27@stanford.edu and
Tweet him at @dohyoung
park.

is truly unparalleled in the
nation. And the sad part is,
very few people outside of
this campus and quite a
few people on this campus
don't see that.
How do we change this?
Well, Class of 2018, it
starts with you.
I'm sure you'll meet some
athletes at Admit Weekend,
but your first taste of what
the student-athlete lifestyle
is like will truly come when

you move in during the end
of September and perhaps
live next door to an Olympic
gold medalist or a starter on
the baseball team. You'll see
how much of their lives, their
time and their identity they
give to their teams in the
gritty, often-thankless pur
suit of again putting Stan
ford at the top of the nation
in athletics. You'll get rolled
out by your RA and the rest
of your dorm to go see them
compete, and you'll have a
much more vested interest
in the success of the pro
grams here because of that
(hopefully).
But this weekend, you
can get the ball rolling by go
ing out to support the per
sonalities that you'll grow to
know and love during your
eventual undergraduate ca
reer here. You can get a taste
of the culture of athletic ex
cellence that pervades this
campus, and you can be part
of the effort to advance that
to a national stage by giving
them your support. Start to
take an active role in convey
ing their stories and their
successes to your friends
and family back home.
Because really, at the end
of the day, the scope of what
the athletes can do to build
Stanford as an athletic pow
erhouse in the eyes of the na
tion as a whole starts and

stops on the field, the court,
the diamond or the mat. It's
really up to you to be their
ambassadors.

Do-Hyoung Park is -prepar
ing for the raging tide- of
prospective freshmen whip
persnappers with lots of

youthful energy on campus
by preparing a disaster kit
and retiring to a hut in
Yosemite for the weekend.

Welcome to the
Farm, Class of
2018! By all ac
counts, you've got
one unforgettable,
hectic, sleepless, action-packed week
end ahead of you. Unfortunately, it
doesn't look like you'll be able to go
fountain hopping because of the
drought, but you'll make new Mends,
meet the people you'll likely be spend
ing the next four years of your life
with, explore an unfamiliar campus
and finally be able to put a face to
those people whose sole purpose in
life seems to be posting in the ad
mitted class' Facebook group.
I know that most of you got into
Stanford because you've focused on
your academics and extracurricu
lars in a seemingly never-ending
pursuit to catch the attention of
your admissions officers. Speaking
frankly, a 5.07 percent admit rate is
absolutely ludicrous. I certainly
know that I wouldn't have gotten in
under this year's admissions stan
dards.
Through all of the craziness,
though, I ask you one thing for this
weekend that you have on campus:
Try to set aside some time to make
it out to a Stanford sports game,
whether it's lacrosse facing off
against Cal tonight, baseball taking
on Cal in a three-game series at
Sunken Diamond or softball host
ing No. 1 Oregon at Smith Family
Stadium for a weekend set.
Stanford is a campus at which
excellence is clearly visible every
day, from the hundreds of freshmen
working late into the night on prob
lem sets or papers to the faculty
that work tirelessly to conduct re
search for which they have a pas
sion. But something that I feel is of
ten unjustly overlooked is how the
excellence carries through to the
athletic department.

Raise your hand if coming into
Stanford, you're aware that this
university is home to the top athlet
ic program in the nation.
Now, I bet not too many of you
have your hands up right now. And
that's exactly the misconception that
I know the athletes and administra
tors on this campus are working tire
lessly to break. They're really doing
all they can; Stanford has won 19
consecutive Directors' Cups (award
ed to the top overall athletic pro
gram in the country) and is comfort
ably ahead in the race for its 20th.
Men's basketball made a miraculous
run to the Sweet 16, while football
qualified for its fourth consecutive
BCS bowl. Soccer, water polo, tennis,
volleyball and women's basketball
are perennial threats to win national
championships.
Yet, the conception of Stanford
as a purely academic school —no
doubt fueled in part by the contin
ued regression of the admit rate
and the continued excellence in the
research from its academic depart
ments pervades society today.
Even within discussions in the
realm of sports, be it on ESPN or
countless online forums, when
Stanford's athletic programs are
mentioned, it's only a matter of
time before somebody comments
on the midterms that the athletes
are studying for or the classes that
they must be skipping god for
bid to play these matches.
Sure, some of the athletes have
embraced that mantra. The athletic
department unveiled its new
#NerdNation identity and really
flaunted it throughout the football
and women's basketball seasons.
Newly minted No. 1 WNBA Draft
selection Chiney Ogwumike even
made a "N-E-R-D-S" music video,
and took the image of the athletic
nerd as her own.
While I admire the athletes'
willingness to embrace that image,
I don't necessarily know if it's good
for a program that's really bursting
onto the forefront of the national
scene with sustained success in the
"major" sports. I think that what
the #NerdNation image has done

Excellence
carries through
to the athletic
department.

is extend the reach of the al
ready-overwhelming sphere
of academic success and ex
panded it into the space of
what should also be an over
whelming sphere of athletic
success.
I think that such an im
age portrays Stanford as an
academic school that is also
really good at sports. I really
don't like that. Stanford is
just as much an athletic
school as it is an academic
school perhaps even more
so. While Stanford's brand of
academic excellence is
clumped together with that
of several other schools in
the country (see: "Harvard
of the West"), Stanford's
brand of athletic excellence
is truly unparalleled in the
nation. And the sad part is,
very few people outside of
this campus and quite a
few people on this campus
don't see that.
