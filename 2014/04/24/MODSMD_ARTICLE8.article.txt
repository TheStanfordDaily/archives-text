## ProFros should be ambassadors for athletics

Welcome to the
Farm, Class of
2018! By all ac
counts, you've got
one unforgettable,
hectic, sleepless, action-packed week
end ahead of you. Unfortunately, it
doesn't look like you'll be able to go
fountain hopping because of the
drought, but you'll make new Mends,
meet the people you'll likely be spend
ing the next four years of your life
with, explore an unfamiliar campus
and finally be able to put a face to
those people whose sole purpose in
life seems to be posting in the ad
mitted class' Facebook group.
I know that most of you got into
Stanford because you've focused on
your academics and extracurricu
lars in a seemingly never-ending
pursuit to catch the attention of
your admissions officers. Speaking
frankly, a 5.07 percent admit rate is
absolutely ludicrous. I certainly
know that I wouldn't have gotten in
under this year's admissions stan
dards.
Through all of the craziness,
though, I ask you one thing for this
weekend that you have on campus:
Try to set aside some time to make
it out to a Stanford sports game,
whether it's lacrosse facing off
against Cal tonight, baseball taking
on Cal in a three-game series at
Sunken Diamond or softball host
ing No. 1 Oregon at Smith Family
Stadium for a weekend set.
Stanford is a campus at which
excellence is clearly visible every
day, from the hundreds of freshmen
working late into the night on prob
lem sets or papers to the faculty
that work tirelessly to conduct re
search for which they have a pas
sion. But something that I feel is of
ten unjustly overlooked is how the
excellence carries through to the
athletic department.

Raise your hand if coming into
Stanford, you're aware that this
university is home to the top athlet
ic program in the nation.
Now, I bet not too many of you
have your hands up right now. And
that's exactly the misconception that
I know the athletes and administra
tors on this campus are working tire
lessly to break. They're really doing
all they can; Stanford has won 19
consecutive Directors' Cups (award
ed to the top overall athletic pro
gram in the country) and is comfort
ably ahead in the race for its 20th.
Men's basketball made a miraculous
run to the Sweet 16, while football
qualified for its fourth consecutive
BCS bowl. Soccer, water polo, tennis,
volleyball and women's basketball
are perennial threats to win national
championships.
Yet, the conception of Stanford
as a purely academic school â€”no
doubt fueled in part by the contin
ued regression of the admit rate
and the continued excellence in the
research from its academic depart
ments pervades society today.
Even within discussions in the
realm of sports, be it on ESPN or
countless online forums, when
Stanford's athletic programs are
mentioned, it's only a matter of
time before somebody comments
on the midterms that the athletes
are studying for or the classes that
they must be skipping god for
bid to play these matches.
Sure, some of the athletes have
embraced that mantra. The athletic
department unveiled its new
#NerdNation identity and really
flaunted it throughout the football
and women's basketball seasons.
Newly minted No. 1 WNBA Draft
selection Chiney Ogwumike even
made a "N-E-R-D-S" music video,
and took the image of the athletic
nerd as her own.
While I admire the athletes'
willingness to embrace that image,
I don't necessarily know if it's good
for a program that's really bursting
onto the forefront of the national
scene with sustained success in the
"major" sports. I think that what
the #NerdNation image has done

Excellence
carries through
to the athletic
department.
