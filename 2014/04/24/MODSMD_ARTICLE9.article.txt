# SEMIFINAL SHOWDOWN
## 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's volleyball
will travel to Provo, Utah on
Thursday to play Pepperdine
in the semifinals of the
MPSF Tournament. The
third-seeded Cardinal are
looking to continue their im
pressive 12-mateh winning
streak, earn a spot in the
MPSF Championship game
and gain an automatic berth
to the NCAA Tournament
after closing out the regular
season playing incredible
volleyball, with aggressive
and consistent performances
that have left the team ap
pearing untouchable.
They have carried their
exceptional play into the
postseason, rallying to de
feat UC-Irvine in a thrilling
five-set quarterfinal tilt that
saw the Cardinal trail 13-12
in the fifth set before they
pushed back to extend their
streak.

"We have to keep elevat
ing our game," said head
coach John Kosty. "Pepper
dine is going to come out
tough, and they are also a
good serving team. We un
derstand what we are good
at and we understand how
Stanford volleyball wins, and
we just have to keep it sim
ple."
Stanford will have to
maintain its patient and
poised mindset while contin
uing to play aggressively and
dominate on offense. Team
work and confidence have
been critical to the Cardi

nal's success, especially on
the road.
Pepperdine downed sev
enth-seeded Long Beach
State in the quarterfinals in
a four-set match for the right
to play the Cardinal. The
Waves are ranked fourth in
the MPSF in both kills
(13.20) and blocks (2.77) per
set. Their offense is led by
junior outside hitter Josh
Taylor, who averages over 4
kills per set. Pepperdine has
had success in the MPSF
Tournament, having reached
the finals eight times and
having won the conference
title in 2002 and 2005; it also
won the tournament in 2008
but was forced to vacate the
win due to NCAA violations
committed by the school's
athletics department.
But while Pepperdine is
seeded higher in the tourna
ment than Stanford, the Car
dinal swept the season series
against the Waves, dropping
just one set over the course
of the two meetings. If Stan
ford wishes to wash Pepper
dine away once again, a key
factor will be the play of sen
ior outside hitters Brian
Cook and Steven Irvin, as
well as classmate Eric
Mochalski. All three seniors
have demonstrated incredi
ble poise and leadership this
season, serving as the emo
tional heart of the team.

They have also led the of
fensive attack this season,
with Cook averaging 4.2

has been one of his squad's more consistent
players this season, playing in all 28
matches while averaging 3.27 kills per set.
points and 3.7 kills per set,
best in that department in
19 matches this season.
Most importantly, the Santa
Cruz, Calif, native has only
been getting stronger as
the season has worn on,
stepping up his game when
necessary to help the Car
dinal extend their winning
streak. Success in Utah this
week will be largely de
pendent on Cook continu
ing to shine in major mo
ments.

Another key player for
the Cardinal will be sopho
more setter James Shaw,
who is 10th in the nation in
assists per set with an aver
age of 10.78. As a team, Stan
ford is fourth in the nation

with over 12 assists per set.
The winner of the match
will earn the opportunity to
play for the MPSF Tourna
ment title. The tournament
champion will then have an
automatic berth into the up
coming NCAA Champi
onships. The NCAA Cham
pionship field will consist of
six teams, with only two
spots available to at-large
squads. Thus, both Stanford
and Pepperdine will be
fighting not only for the
chance at the MPSF title,
but also for NCAA Tourna
ment positioning.
Stanford's match will be
at 4 p.m today at BYU's
Smith Fieldhouse. The sec
ond semifinal will see the
host, No. 1 seed BYU, play
No. 4 seed UC-Santa Bar
bara later in the evening.
