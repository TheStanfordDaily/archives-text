A
UNCOVERING THE
TRUTH IN THE
ELECTRONIC MEDIA
AGE
The second intifada against
Israel in 2000 was sparked
by an iconic image. The
Israeli military was accused
by French state television of
intentionally killing
Muhamad al-Dura as he
cowered next to his father.
How could this episode have precipitated suicide
bombings against Israelis, yet be considered a staged
media event by some?
And if information exists that would exonerate the Israeli
military, why would its government try to sweep this
under the rug? (J'Lem Post 7-11-13)
Philippe Karsenty, French journalist cum politician, has
the answers to these questions, and more. Come hear his
expose of this tawdry affair from his battles to unearth the
facts of this case, to the squelching of his freedom of
speech in the land of Liberte...
As the prophet of viral media Mark Twain once quipped:
'"A he can traveh hafy way around the worhch whiCe the truth is stifl
putting on its shoes."
