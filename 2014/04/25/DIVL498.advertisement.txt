The Stanford Storytelling Project and Stanford Continuing Studies present
An Evening with Sherman Alexie
Friday, April 25
7:30 pm
CEMEX Auditorium
Knight Management Center
Stanford University
Free and open to public
Described by The New York Times as "one of the
major lyric voices of our time," Sherman Alexie has
become one of our culture's most important storytellers.
Whether in poetry, short fiction, the novel, or film,
Alexie gives us story as our most essential allyâ€”
story as the best way we can make sense, use,
and sometimes heal the absurdity and suffering in
the world. His stories of contemporary American
Indian life, laced with razor-sharp humor, unsettling
candor, and biting wit, give us reason to have the
same faith in storytelling.
Join us for a special evening filled with stories of
Alexie's own life and counsel for the storyteller in
all of us.
