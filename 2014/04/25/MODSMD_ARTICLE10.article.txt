## Stanford STAND Stanford should push Kagame on human rights 
### 
Rwandan President Paul Kagame
will speak at the Graduate
School of Business on Friday af
ternoon as part of the Center for
Global Business and the Economy's
Global Speaker Series. The event's
description praises Kagame's "lead
ership in peace building and recon
ciliation, development, good gover
nance, promotion of human rights
and women's empowerment, and
advancement of education."
It is true that in the wake of the
1994 genocide, Rwanda under
Kagame â€”who served as vice pres
ident immediately following the
genocide, and was elected president
in 2000 has seen a remarkable
rate of economic growth, rise in lit
eracy and life expectancy, increase
in the provision of public goods such
as roads and drinking water and a
marked improvement in the repre
sentation of women in government.
As we mark the 20th anniversary of
the Rwandan genocide, one of the
darkest moments in modern history,
we should certainly not overlook

Rwanda's significant achievements
in the aftermath of the unthinkable
events of 1994.

There is, however, a darker side
to President Kagame, and Stanford
should not praise his "promotion of
human rights" when in fact count
less allegations of appalling human
rights violations, both in Rwanda
and abroad, hang over the head of
Kagame and his administration.
In the years following the geno
cide, Rwanda was a driving force be
hind two invasions of the neighbor
ing Democratic Republic of the Con
go, which sparked a conflict in the
Congo that continues to this day and
that has so far killed over five million
people, displacing millions more. A
UN report released last year an
nounced that, as had long been sus
pected, Rwanda was providing sig
nificant support to the Congo-based
rebel group M 23, which has posed a
major threat to peace and stability in
the eastern Congo and contributed
greatly to the ongoing destabiliza
tion of the country.

On the domestic side,
Kagame's administration has been
accused by numerous authorities,
including Human Rights Watch and
the U.S. Department of State's an
nual human rights reports, of using
political imprisonments, arbitrary ar
rests, extrajudicial killings and more
against political opponents of the
Rwandan Patriotic Front, Kagame's
party. A recent article in the Wall
Street Journal entitled "How Rwan
da's Paul Kagame Exploits U.S.
Guilt" details many of these issues.
We recognize the privilege of
being at a university where such
prominent figures are brought in to
speak, and we strongly believe that
the advancements that have been
made in rebuilding Rwanda after the
genocide should be celebrated and
encouraged. We do not believe,
however, that the Stanford adminis
tration, the GSB or the student body
as a whole should ignore the serious
allegations that have been leveled
