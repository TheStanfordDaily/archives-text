# Personalization and scale: the Holy Grail
## 
### Angad Singh 
There is no doubt that technology is consum
ing our world at a rapidly accelerating pace.
First, the Industrial Revolution only a
couple of centuries ago completely trans
formed how we make and consume things. Then,
the effect of the information revolution of the last
few decades has been in a league of its own.
Indeed, many of the things for which we
used to need to interact with other people can
now be done with a few taps on a glass surface.
There's no need to stand out on the sidewalk to
hail a taxi or superficially greet the cashier at the
grocery store anymore. Technology has not only
brought us convenience, it has also given us
scale. Anyone anywhere can access information
about anything anytime.

At the same time, it's helpful to think about
what we've given up. Volumes have been written
about how our world has lost the human touch as
a result of this progress. Only a few centuries ago,
every pair of shoes was a limited edition. The per
son who made your shoes could identify your
foot in the dark by its shape and could make the
perfect pair for you. Not long ago, when you
walked into your bookstore, the storekeeper
knew just the book you should read next because
he/she knew you so well. (I must concede that
these were not services that the average person
would have had access to back in the day.)
Through both manufacturing and high tech
nology, letting go of the human touch has allowed
us to produce products at an unprecedented
scale, boosting the tangible standard of living for
billions. Herein lies the central conflict of this dis
cussion. Technology has given us so much, but it
also forces us into decisions we would rather not
make.

Consider news as an example. Until a few
centuries ago, news was primarily distributed by
word of mouth or letters. You only knew things
other people chose to tell you about. Then, news
papers came along and people learned about all
kinds of things they didn't know to ask for. Today,
we are not limited by our local newspapers any
more and can quickly get updates from any cor
ner of the world as they happen.
The power of this scale and access is undis
puted. However, personalization is no longer a
service that is available to the average person.
Every day, millions of people go to popular news
websites like CNN to read the news. However,
every one of them sees the exact same page when
they first arrive on the site and I don't think that's
justified at all. Some people don't care about glob-

al politics at all, while others only read sports cov
erage about one specific team. Technology gives
us amazing access, but we have to pay for it with
the burden of making our own choices for us
and not just the major choices in life but also de
cisions that are comparatively mundane.
Indeed, scale automatically brings with it a
small amount of personalization. At the level of
choosing what site to visit and what article to click
on, each one of us is empowered to personalize
the experience for ourselves through the choices
we make. However, what we need is for these
choices to be made for us. While less choice
sounds like a bad thing, theories like the Paradox
of Choice and Decision Paralysis show that we ac
tually prefer less choice than more. What we
need, then, is something that brings together both
access and personalization. On the one hand, we
don't always want to choose what we consume,
but on the other hand, we don't want our options
to be limited by arbitrary factors like where we are
and what the majority thinks.

This idea of offering personalization at scale
has always been the holy grail of technology, and
recently, we have seen a few examples that bring
both those ideas together. The algorithms of Net
flix and Amazon use scale to their advantage in
personalizing. Owing to the scale of their opera
tions, they have data on the behavior of millions of
users. That lets them make really good guesses
about your preferences based on the prior choices
of people like you. They can also let the algorithm
have access to a massive set of choices, which
could potentially bring to the surface obscure
things you didn't even know you were interested
in. And I see this as just the tip of the iceberg.

Whenever I see an interaction that is the
same across a large number of people, I wonder
if it always has to be that way. When thousands of
people drive by a billboard, should they all see the
same advertisement? Should everyone watching
a movie have to watch it at the same pace and in
the same order? Should all students in class have
to get the same homework assignment? If not, is
it possible to build a world that is truly personal
ized? Even though technology has traditionally
been at odds with personalization, I see personal
ization as the next big trend in technology. Of
course we won't be entirely reduced to algo
rithms, but I think technology will play a key role
in true personalization.
