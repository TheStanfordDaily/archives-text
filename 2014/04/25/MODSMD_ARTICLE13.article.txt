## M. VOLLEYBALL Card into MPSF finals 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's volleyball swept Pepperdine in a near
perfect performance on Thursday, earning the Cardinal a
spot in the MPSF championship match this weekend.
In terms of seeding, the victory for No. 3 Stanford
over No. 2 Pepperdine may have been an upset, but with
Stanford's dominant performances lately, the win was no

same category. No Pepperdine player had more than 6
kills on the night, with Nikola Antonijevic leading the
Waves with six and a .400 hitting percentage. Stanford
had 10 blocks on the night and senior libero Grant Del

Stanford's offense was led once again by senior out
side hitter Brian Cook, who had 17 kills and hit .667 for
the match. Many of the recently named AVCA All-Amer
ican's 17 kills came during crucial points during the
match, providing the Cardinal with momentum.
"Brian dictated the action on the court tonight. His
