## M. VOLLEYBALL Card into MPSF finals 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's volleyball swept Pepperdine in a near
perfect performance on Thursday, earning the Cardinal a
spot in the MPSF championship match this weekend.
In terms of seeding, the victory for No. 3 Stanford
over No. 2 Pepperdine may have been an upset, but with
Stanford's dominant performances lately, the win was no
surprise. Thursday's win increases the Cardinal's winning
streak to 13, during which they have only lost nine sets.
Such a long winning streak, especially in the talented
MPSF, is truly an incredible accomplishment.
Stanford looked stronger than ever in the semifinal
match. The team came out with confidence and drive,
controlling the match from the very beginning and never
looking back.
"I think we played Stanford volleyball tonight," said
head coach John Kosty. "We passed well and didn't give
up too many unforced errors. We had a solid all-around
game and played to our potential."
Stanford's win was the third this season against Pep
perdine and completed a season sweep of the Waves.
And while the Waves are a very strong team, the Cardinal
outperformed Pepperdine on almost every level through
out the match. Stanford outhit Pepperdine, recording a
.474 hitting percentage on the night, the second-best
performance for the team this season. Perhaps more im
pressively, Stanford held Pepperdine to just .114 in the
same category. No Pepperdine player had more than 6
kills on the night, with Nikola Antonijevic leading the
Waves with six and a .400 hitting percentage. Stanford
had 10 blocks on the night and senior libero Grant Del
gado finished with six digs.
Stanford's offense was led once again by senior out
side hitter Brian Cook, who had 17 kills and hit .667 for
the match. Many of the recently named AVCA All-Amer
ican's 17 kills came during crucial points during the
match, providing the Cardinal with momentum.
"Brian dictated the action on the court tonight. His
hitting numbers reflect that," Kosty said.
"But, I thought it was a nice performance
overall. Everyone contributed."
Stanford never trailed Pepperdine by
more than two points, and won each set by
at least six. In the first set, Stanford started
out aggressively and jumped out to an early
14-8 lead. Pepperdine took a pair of timeouts
before the set hit the halfway mark, and the
Cardinal went on to win the first set 25-16
with impressive performances from Steven
Irvin and senior Eric Mochalski. Stanford is
19-3 on the season when it wins the opening
set.

Pepperdine stepped up its game in the
second set and was even outhitting the Car
dinal .375 to .222 at one point. The set was
tied at 6-6 and again at 11-11 but Stanford
started to build a lead after that point. How
ever, it was clear the Waves were not going
to go away without a fight, and they managed
to cut the Cardinal lead to a single point a
few more times during the second set. Stan
ford won set two 25-19, the closest of the
three sets.

Stanford really turned it into high gear in
the third set. It was clear that the Cardinal,
who are undefeated in three-set matches,
wanted to close out the match and not give
Pepperdine an opportunity to rally back.
Stanford's offense was in prime condi
tion during the beginning of the set, with
everything working well for the Cardinal. The
Waves, however, were struggling to find a
rhythm and had a couple critical errors down
the stretch that gave Stanford an advantage.
Cook got five of his kills in the last half of the
third set, dominating the court and providing
confidence that the rest of the team fed off.

Everyone stepped up in major ways to
close out the match, with junior Spencer Haly
getting an impressive kill at 17-11 and later
Conrad Kaminski and James Shaw getting a
late-set block at 22-14. For the night, Irvin
had 9 kills and Mochalski had 7. Sophomore
setter James Shaw was the key to the con
trolled and consistent offensive performance
with 39 assists. It seemed that Stanford's en
tire roster stepped up and worked together to
produce a near-perfect offensive perform
ance.

Stanford will face BYU, the winner of
the other semifinal match, on Saturday with
the MPSF title on the line.
