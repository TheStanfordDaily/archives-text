# TITLE OR BUST
## STANFORD LOOKS TO ERASE MPSF WOES 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
Despite the recent dominance of
Stanford women's water polo on the na
tional stage, including four consecutive
appearances in the national title match
and a pair of NCAA titles to show for it in
2011 and 2012, the Cardinal have had a
surprisingly tough time within their con
ference tournaments as of late. In fact,
when the No. 1 Cardinal (20-1, 6-0
MPSF) take the pool for this weekend's
MPSF Tournament, they will be seeking
their first conference title since 2006 at
the tail end of yet another phenomenal
regular season a familiar storyline in
recent years.

The Cardinal have narrowly missed
out on that elusive title in the last two sea

sons, losing the 2013 MPSF champi
onship to the eventual national champion
USC Trojans in a precursor to the national
title match, and falling just short in 2012
in an overtime heartbreaker to UCLA. In
each of the five years preceding those two
losses, Stanford had also finished in the
top three of the conference tournament.
And even though the Cardinal are
the top team in the nation and are cur
rently riding an 11-game winning streak
against some of the most talented offens
es in the country, an MPSF title is defi
nitely no certainty, especially in the midst
of a deep and powerful conference that
offers threats from all directions.
Although Stanford has had an easy
time against the bottom half of the confer
ence this season, the Cardinal are part of
a three-pronged threat atop the confer

ence with No. 2 UCLA and No. 3 USC,
which have both also emerged as national
powerhouses in recent seasons. Despite
Stanford's victories over both the Bruins
and Trojans in its dominant run to close
out the regular season, the Cardinal can
not afford to overlook two very talented
teams that have given them postseason
trouble in recent years.
That being said, the Cardinal offense
has enjoyed another highly successful reg
ular season, featuring two 40-goal scorers
in juniors Kiley Neushul (42) and Ashley
Grossman (40). In addition, a diverse of
fense with scoring threats from all around
the pool has also featured three more 30-
goal scorers in sophomore Maggie Stef
fens (38), senior Annika Dries (37) and

sophomore Anna Yelizarova (34) in
just the program's fifth season with
five 30-goal scorers on the same
squad. The offense currently ranks
second in the MPSF with 13.71
goals per match.
In addition, the defense has
been dominant over the Cardinal's
recent run, in which it has held
teams like UCLA, USC and Arizona
State to no more than eight goals
apiece. In fact, the Cardinal only al
lowed over six goals on one occasion
over its tough six-match streak to
close the season, to No. 2 UCLA in
a narrow 9-8 win.

Sophomore goalkeeper Gabby
Stone has helped to anchor a stiff de
fense with her 6.12 goals-against av
erage as the Cardinal defense fin
ished the season ranked third in the

MPSF by allowing just 5.95 goals per
match. However, even though the
defense has been solid down the
stretch, it suffered from some incon
sistencies earlier this season, includ
ing allowing nine goals to UCLA in
February for its only loss of the sea
son.

That defense will need to hold
strong as it will be likely be tested fe
rociously again in the championship
match of the tournament. Especially
with the Stanford offense having
failed to record more than nine goals
in its late-season wins over USC,
UCLA and Cal, if the defense has an
off match, it could easily spell trou
ble for the Cardinal again.
With the Cardinal having
earned a first-round bye with its first
place conference finish, they will
await the victor of the quarterfinal
match between fourth-seeded Cal
and fifth-seeded San Jose State. If
Stanford can complete season
sweeps of either the Golden Bears

or the Spartans in that match, it will
likely set up another monumental
duel with either UCLA or USC in
the finals in what could again be a
precursor to the eventual national ti
tle match.
Even though the Cardinal, as
the top-ranked team in the country,
are almost certain to earn an at-large
berth in the NCAA tournament even
with a loss in the MPSFs, they will
be looking to lock down the auto
matic qualification to the tourna
ment with that elusive conference ti
tle. With USC playing host to the
tournament, giving USC and UCLA
a home-field advantage, it certainly
won't be an easy road to the top for
the Cardinal.
Stanford will kick off its MPSF
Tournament run in its semifinal
match on Saturday at 2:30 p.m. in
Los Angeles.
