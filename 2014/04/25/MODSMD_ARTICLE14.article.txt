# TITLE OR BUST
## STANFORD LOOKS TO ERASE MPSF WOES 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
Despite the recent dominance of
Stanford women's water polo on the na
tional stage, including four consecutive
appearances in the national title match
and a pair of NCAA titles to show for it in
2011 and 2012, the Cardinal have had a
surprisingly tough time within their con
ference tournaments as of late. In fact,
when the No. 1 Cardinal (20-1, 6-0
MPSF) take the pool for this weekend's
MPSF Tournament, they will be seeking
their first conference title since 2006 at
the tail end of yet another phenomenal
regular season a familiar storyline in
recent years.

The Cardinal have narrowly missed
out on that elusive title in the last two sea

sons, losing the 2013 MPSF champi
onship to the eventual national champion
USC Trojans in a precursor to the national
title match, and falling just short in 2012
in an overtime heartbreaker to UCLA. In
each of the five years preceding those two
losses, Stanford had also finished in the
top three of the conference tournament.
And even though the Cardinal are
the top team in the nation and are cur
rently riding an 11-game winning streak
against some of the most talented offens
es in the country, an MPSF title is defi
nitely no certainty, especially in the midst
of a deep and powerful conference that
offers threats from all directions.
Although Stanford has had an easy
time against the bottom half of the confer
ence this season, the Cardinal are part of
a three-pronged threat atop the confer

ence with No. 2 UCLA and No. 3 USC,
which have both also emerged as national
powerhouses in recent seasons. Despite
Stanford's victories over both the Bruins
and Trojans in its dominant run to close
out the regular season, the Cardinal can
not afford to overlook two very talented
teams that have given them postseason
trouble in recent years.
That being said, the Cardinal offense
has enjoyed another highly successful reg
ular season, featuring two 40-goal scorers
in juniors Kiley Neushul (42) and Ashley
Grossman (40). In addition, a diverse of
fense with scoring threats from all around
the pool has also featured three more 30-
goal scorers in sophomore Maggie Stef
fens (38), senior Annika Dries (37) and

Senior Annika Dries (above) has helped the Cardinal win an NCAA title, but she still hasn't seen Stanford come out on top in
the MPSFTournament. The 37-goal scorer and her teammates will look to change that this weekend in Los Angeles.
