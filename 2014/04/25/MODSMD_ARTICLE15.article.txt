# Card seek elusive Pac-12 title
## 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
To say that the Cardinal athletics pro
gram has been successful on the conference
level would be the understatement of the
century. With literally hundreds of Pac-12
team and individual champions in its histo
ry, Stanford has truly earned the moniker
"Home of Champions."
However, this legacy of winning has not
been spread equally among the Farm's 36
intercollegiate sports. The men's and
women's golf programs have been on the
short end of the stick for the past few
decades, combining for just two Pac-10/12
titles since 1992 and none since the
turn of the millennium.
But hope does indeed spring eternal:
Despite playing in far and away the most
competitive conference tournaments in the
nation this weekend, both squads are
poised to deliver performances worthy of
victory. To split a hair, the men, led by sen

ior Cameron Wilson and outgoing junior
Patrick Rodgers, might have the slightly eas
ier road to the program's first league title
since 1994.
"It has been quite a while since the
Stanford Cardinal have been able to pull out
a Pac-10/12 championship," said head coach
Conrad Ray. "So we're eager and hungry to
go play well. I don't know if underperfor
mance has been the case in terms of not
winning the championship; the Pac-12 is
stacked year-in and year-out and we've had
some close calls, but just haven't been able
to get over the hump and win the confer
ence tournament."
Perennial powerhouse Cal isn't quite as
dominant as in years past after seeing the
departure of juggernauts Michael Kim and
Max Homa. Nevertheless, the Bears, led by
2013 Masters and U.S. Open participant
Michael Weaver and fellow senior Brandon
Hagy, easily pose the most serious threat to
extend Stanford's Pac-12 drought.
Conrad Ray's sextet, which sits one

spot behind its No. 5 archrival in
Golf Week's NCAA team rankings, will
counter with the first- and eighth-ranked
amateur golfers in the world in Rodgers and
Wilson, both of whom will be aiming to win
their first individual conference titles in the
final Pac-12 event of their careers.
And not only will they have to contend
with a strong field, but they will have to ne
gotiate an equally tough golf course as well.
"[The Gallery in Tucson] is a desert
course requiring some accuracy off the tee
to keep it out of the sand, as well as the
greens being challenging with quite a bit of
undulation and [bunkers]," Ray said. "So
we've been working on our trajectory con
trol and ball flight and knowing that there
could be some wind potentially in the
desert. It'll also be probably quite a bit
warmer than we're used to, so hopefully our
continued fitness and focus on cardiovascu
lar strength over the last couple months will

Junior Patrick Rodgers (above) will aim to help Stanford men's golf win its first Pac-10/12 title in 20 years before he leaves to play
professionally. With perennial favorite Cal having a down year, this might be the Cardinal's chance to bring a championship back to the Farm.
