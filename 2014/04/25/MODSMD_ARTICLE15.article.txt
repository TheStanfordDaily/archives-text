# Card seek elusive Pac-12 title
## 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
To say that the Cardinal athletics pro
gram has been successful on the conference
level would be the understatement of the
century. With literally hundreds of Pac-12
team and individual champions in its histo
ry, Stanford has truly earned the moniker
"Home of Champions."
However, this legacy of winning has not
been spread equally among the Farm's 36
intercollegiate sports. The men's and
women's golf programs have been on the
short end of the stick for the past few
decades, combining for just two Pac-10/12
titles since 1992 and none since the
turn of the millennium.
But hope does indeed spring eternal:
Despite playing in far and away the most
competitive conference tournaments in the
nation this weekend, both squads are
poised to deliver performances worthy of
victory. To split a hair, the men, led by sen

ior Cameron Wilson and outgoing junior
Patrick Rodgers, might have the slightly eas
ier road to the program's first league title
since 1994.
"It has been quite a while since the
Stanford Cardinal have been able to pull out
a Pac-10/12 championship," said head coach
Conrad Ray. "So we're eager and hungry to
go play well. I don't know if underperfor
mance has been the case in terms of not
winning the championship; the Pac-12 is
stacked year-in and year-out and we've had
some close calls, but just haven't been able
to get over the hump and win the confer
ence tournament."
Perennial powerhouse Cal isn't quite as
dominant as in years past after seeing the
departure of juggernauts Michael Kim and
Max Homa. Nevertheless, the Bears, led by
2013 Masters and U.S. Open participant
Michael Weaver and fellow senior Brandon
Hagy, easily pose the most serious threat to
extend Stanford's Pac-12 drought.
Conrad Ray's sextet, which sits one

spot behind its No. 5 archrival in
Golf Week's NCAA team rankings, will
counter with the first- and eighth-ranked
amateur golfers in the world in Rodgers and
Wilson, both of whom will be aiming to win
their first individual conference titles in the
final Pac-12 event of their careers.
And not only will they have to contend
with a strong field, but they will have to ne
gotiate an equally tough golf course as well.
"[The Gallery in Tucson] is a desert
course requiring some accuracy off the tee
to keep it out of the sand, as well as the
greens being challenging with quite a bit of
undulation and [bunkers]," Ray said. "So
we've been working on our trajectory con
trol and ball flight and knowing that there
could be some wind potentially in the
desert. It'll also be probably quite a bit
warmer than we're used to, so hopefully our
continued fitness and focus on cardiovascu
lar strength over the last couple months will

Junior Patrick Rodgers (above) will aim to help Stanford men's golf win its first Pac-10/12 title in 20 years before he leaves to play
professionally. With perennial favorite Cal having a down year, this might be the Cardinal's chance to bring a championship back to the Farm.
pay off."
But the current heat of this
Stanford team may actually rival
that of a Tucson afternoon: The
squad is coming off arguably its
best performance of the season at
the Western Intercollegiate, where
it picked up the team victory and
individual medalist honors courtesy
of Wilson.
That performance was just the
latest of an upward trend that has
seen the Cardinal win three out of
its last four starts; their current roll
is certainly an encouraging sign as
they embark on what they hope is
a lengthy postseason run. With the
memory of last year's disappoint
ment at the NCAA Columbus Re
gional still stuck in the craw of
some, the unit's urgency will be at
a season high.
The women, on the other
hand, will need to overcome a sig
nificantly tougher challenge if they
are to capture their first Pac-12
championship since 1999.
Six Pac-12 teams sit in

Golf Week's top 10, including the
two frontrunners, USC and UCLA.
The 2013-14 Trojans and Bruins
are amongst the greatest women's
golf teams in NCAA history: USC
alone has four players in the World
Amateur Golf Ranking top 40, in
cluding defending national champi
on Annie Park. UCLA boasts three
women in the top 40 as well, while
Stanford has just oneâ€”you
guessed it, Mariah Stackhouse.

But head coach Anne Walker
will also throw out two of colle
giate golf's fastest-rising stars, Lau
ren Kim and Casey Danielson, both
of whom have carried the Card this
spring season. Ultimately, though,
it will likely take a Herculean effort
to take down the SoCal duo at
Trysting Tree Golf Club in Corval
lis, Oregon.
"I've never played Trysting
Tree, but I've heard the rough is
thick and it's important to keep the
ball in the fairway," Kim said. "I
don't think that will be a problem
for us, because we're a good ball
striking team. I think we'll try to
keep the ball in the short grass
and stay focused on playing boring
golf. That will give us good oppor
tunities for birdie and will mini

mize mistakes."
Unlike the men's tourney, the
Pac-12 Women's Golf Champi
onship is a "play-five-count-four"
event, meaning that Mariko Tu
mangan, Quirine Eijkenboom or
Marissa Mar will have to turn in a
respectable fourth score if the Car
dinal are to have any chance of win
ning. Depth was an issue for Stan
ford at this event last year, when it
put only two golfers in the individ
ual top 15.
"I think we're feeling good
heading into this event," Kim re
marked. "I think everyone is at a
good place individually... we have
shown we can compete with the
best teams in the country and it
just so happens they're in our con
ference. But regardless of the re
sult, we want to prepare ourselves
for NCAAs and work on the mind
set that will help us finish well
there."
Both the men's and women's
Pac-12 tournaments begin Friday
and conclude Sunday, with live
