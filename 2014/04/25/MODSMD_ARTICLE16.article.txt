# Pick a school for its sports
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
Should you choose a school for its
sports? If you're a Pro Fro, that's a
question you might be asking yourself
this weekend. And if you're the kind
of Pro Fro I was three years ago I
may or may not have ducked out of one night of
my Admit Weekend to go to a Sharks playoff
game the answer is yes.
I actually might not have grown so interest
ed in Stanford if not for its athletics; that's what
18 years of Cardinal basketball and football
games did to me (and thank god for that).
I know I'm at an extreme. But in my view,
athletics should factor into everyone's college de-

cision, whether sports
aren't really your cup of
tea or whether a Big
Gulp's worth is an inte
gral part of your life al
ready.
Going to a school
with a major athletics
program fundamentally

changes your college experience. Of course,
there's the cliched camaraderie of a crammed
student body screaming in unison from the end
zone, of tailgates and touchdown celebrations,
cheerleaders and chest paint. We've had that
here in spades for four-plus years.
But at Stanford or any other top-tier ath
letic school, for that matter college sports will
also permeate your life in meaningful ways that
you hardly notice.
It's a powerful moment, the first time you
realize that you're living down the hall from an
athlete you've seen on TV or that you're sitting
in class next to someone with a red backpack and
a green Gatorade bottle. And then you'll get to
talking with that student-athlete, and you'll real
ize that even with all the hours they spend main
taining an almost impossible lifestyle, they're
still, at the end of the day, just a person. You'll
never again see Richard Sherman the same way
and you'll never again doubt how much is out
there to be accomplished.
Even more importantly, sports find away to
capture the identity and emotions of a school.
From an outward point of view, I've seen at
least two athletes the impeccable Andrew
Luck my freshman year and the vivacious Chiney
Ogwumike this year become a name and face
for this student body to proudly rally behind. But

from an inward one, I've also seen Jordan
Williamson's story shake and then uplift this cam
pus. As much as people still lite to crack jokes
about field goals around here, there's not a person
who follows Cardinal football that didn't learn a
thing or two about perseverance from number 19.
So when you're choosing a school, mate
sure to give athletics its due. You're not indulging
some guilty pleasure; you're considering a factor

that will have a significant impact on the next
four years of your life, not to mention the many
more years of fanhood that will hopefully follow.
I'm happy to be one of the many people
who will tell you this weekend that there's no
one right choice when picking a college. And I'm
also happy to remind you that 19 Directors'
Cups don't lie.
