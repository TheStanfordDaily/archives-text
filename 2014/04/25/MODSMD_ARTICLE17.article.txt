# Stanford hopes to stay hot
## 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN DESK EDITOR 
It's amazing what difference a week
can make. In recent days, Stanford base
ball (17-17, 6-9 Pac-12) has gone from
scrounging for wins to avoid hitting the
Pac-12 cellar to winning six out of its last
seven games its best stretch of the
season and now sits at eighth in the
conference standings, four games behind
Oregon for third place.
All of a sudden, the Cardinal have
been infused with a new optimism as
they begin the second half of the confer
ence schedule, which will be consider
ably easier than the first part. After open
ing conference play with weekend series
against nearly every team in the top half
of the conference (Washington, Oregon
State, Oregon, Arizona State and USC),
the Card will now face every team in the

bottom half of the standings, beginning
with a three-game tilt with Cal (16-19, 5-
10) at Sunken Diamond this weekend.
The Cardinal got the better of their
rivals across the Bay with an 11-1 victory
in the teams' only meeting this season on
March 4 in Berkeley, a Tuesday afternoon
game that saw Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess pick up his 1,500 th career win.
The two teams were also set to square off
in another Tuesday game on April 1, but
that game was canceled due to rain.
After freshman starter Brett
Hanewich (1-3) helped the Card pick up
a win in Wednesday's game at St. Mary's,
the Cardinal will bump up freshman Cal
Quantrill (3-4) in the rotation to start the
first game on Saturday.
Junior lefty John Hochstatter (5-1),
who will start Sunday's game, has come
on strong since taking over the third slot
in the weekend rotation from freshman

Chris Viall (2-3), throwing a shutout
through 7.2 innings in last Saturday's win
against Arizona State while flirting with a
no-hitter.
The starter for Monday's game is still
unclear. Marquess and pitching coach
Rusty Filter will likely give the ball back to
Hanewich on four days' rest, but there is
a possibility that either Viall or fellow
freshman Tyler Thorne (2-0) gets the
start.
At the plate, look for junior third
baseman Alex Blandino to try to continue
his recent offensive outburst. Blandino
leads the team in almost every major sta
tistical category at-bats, runs, batting
average and home runs and lifted the
Cardinal over the Gaels on Wednesday
with a pair of homers.
The Golden Bears, who will try to
improve on the 11 runs they surrendered
to Stanford in March, will send out fresh
man righty Daulton Jefferies (2-4) for the
first game of the series, and senior lefty
Kyle Porter (4-4) will start game two. Both
Jefferies and Porter went seven innings
deep in Cal's last series against Washing
ton, and both have the potential to keep
Stanford off the scoreboard for long
stretches.
Offensively, the Bears will look for
strong performances from junior infielder
Derek Campbell, who holds a .265 aver
age with 15 RBIs, and from senior first
baseman Devon Rodriguez, who leads the
team with 18 RBIs.
The upcoming series is an important
one for both teams as Cal looks to make a
move out of the 11-hole in the confer
ence standings while Stanford, with a
sweep, can return to .500 in conference
play.
The outcome of the series will help
determine if Stanford can truly fight its
way back up into contention in the Pac
-12, or if its recent string of victories was
nothing more than a fluke in a season
marred by inconsistency.
Many questions hang in the balance
as the series begins at Sunken Diamond
on Saturday at 2 p.m., followed by games
on Sunday at 2 p.m. and Monday at 6
p.m.

a possibility that either Viall or fellow
freshman Tyler Thorne (2-0) gets the
start.
At the plate, look for junior third
baseman Alex Blandino to try to continue
his recent offensive outburst. Blandino
leads the team in almost every major sta
tistical category at-bats, runs, batting
average and home runs and lifted the
Cardinal over the Gaels on Wednesday
with a pair of homers.
The Golden Bears, who will try to
improve on the 11 runs they surrendered
to Stanford in March, will send out fresh
man righty Daulton Jefferies (2-4) for the
first game of the series, and senior lefty
Kyle Porter (4-4) will start game two. Both
Jefferies and Porter went seven innings
deep in Cal's last series against Washing
ton, and both have the potential to keep
Stanford off the scoreboard for long
stretches.
Offensively, the Bears will look for
strong performances from junior infielder
Derek Campbell, who holds a .265 aver
age with 15 RBIs, and from senior first
baseman Devon Rodriguez, who leads the
team with 18 RBIs.
The upcoming series is an important
one for both teams as Cal looks to make a
move out of the 11-hole in the confer
ence standings while Stanford, with a
sweep, can return to .500 in conference
play.
The outcome of the series will help
determine if Stanford can truly fight its
way back up into contention in the Pac
-12, or if its recent string of victories was
nothing more than a fluke in a season
marred by inconsistency.
Many questions hang in the balance
as the series begins at Sunken Diamond
on Saturday at 2 p.m., followed by games
on Sunday at 2 p.m. and Monday at 6
p.m.

Junior third baseman Alex Blandino (above) leads the Cardinal in nearly every major
statistical category. Stanford will have to continue to produce offensively if it
wants to keep moving up the Pac-12 standings, starting with a series against Cal.
