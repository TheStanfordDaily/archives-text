## Card take aim at Ducks 
### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In his Academy Award-winning
song "Lose Yourself," Eminem raps
about taking advantage of a singular
opportunity to "seize everything you
ever wanted." For Stanford softball
(27-18, 3-12 Pac-12), that one mo
ment for the Cardinal to make their
push toward the postseason will take
place this weekend at home against
the No. 1 Oregon Ducks (41-5, 14-
1). Quite simply, this weekend repre
sents a chance for the Card "to cap
ture it or just let it slip."
With an RPI of 51, Stanford is in
need of wins over marquee competi
tion to boost its NCAA tournament
resume. A Ducks squad that is in the
midst of its finest season in program
history would certainly qualify as the
type of opponent that the Cardinal
need to beat. But at the same time,
defeating an Oregon team that has
lost once in the month of April is eas
ier said than done.
After a road loss to BYU back on
March 25, Oregon has proceeded to
dominate its Pac-12 competition,
with sweeps against Washington,
Oregon State and Cal and a series
win over UCLA. The Ducks have
notched six run-rule victories in the
process, including an 18-0 annihila
tion of Oregon State.
At the same time, however, the
Ducks' run to No. 1 in the polls coin
cided with a massive homestand, as
Oregon has played only three of its
last 16 games on the road, with those
road contests coming at struggling
OSU. Therefore, while the Ducks
represent the Cardinal's most formi
dable test this season, Oregon is cer
tainly not infallible. More specifically,
Oregon had significant trouble in its
most recent game against Portland
State, a team that the Card utterly de

stroyed in two run-rule victories. Al
though PSU has an RPI of 265, the
Ducks needed two home runs in the
bottom of the sixth inning to survive
against the Vikings and eke out a 4-2
win in Eugene.
Oregon has achieved its monu
mental success this season with a
tremendous balance of hitting and
pitching. At the plate, leadoff hitter
Courtney Ceo has established herself
as a strong contender for the Pac-12
Player of the Year award, as she leads
the Pac-12 in batting average by near
ly 40 points with a .486 mark. How
ever, the senior from Meadow Vista,
California has not simply relied on
small ball to get on base, as Ceo also
has 12 extra-base hits, including 3
home runs, to go along with 28 RBIs.
Finally, Ceo is second on her team in
stolen bases, with 10 steals in 14 at
tempts.

Ceo is joined by fellow senior
Alexa Peterson, another key contrib
utor to the Ducks' potent offensive
attack. Peterson, who was a high
school teammate of Cardinal infield
er Lauren Donovan at South Salem
(Oregon) High School, is currently
third in the Pac-12 in RBIs, with 51 in
46 games. A 2013 NFCA First Team
Ail-American and NFCA First Team
Academic Ail-American, Peterson has
been able to follow up on an extraor
dinary junior campaign with an
equally impressive senior season; the
Salem, Oregon, native has hit .367
with a team-leading 10 doubles, 7
home runs and an outstanding .642
slugging percentage.
Finally, the Cardinal pitching ro
tation will have to be mindful of soph
omore Janelle Lindvall. A high school
teammate of Cardinal freshman Kylie
Sorenson, Lindvall is second on the
team in home runs with 10 to go
