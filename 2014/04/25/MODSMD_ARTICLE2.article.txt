## Guide to Admit Weekend 2014 Recommendations from The Daily for navigating around campus this weekend 
### SEVDE KALDIROGLU 
Congratulations, ProFros (prospec
tive freshmen get ready for the abbre
viations) on being admitted to Stanford,
and welcome to Admit Weekend 2014!

You might want to be in the know as
to what experiences to get while you're
here on campus for a short weekend, so
we at The Daily compiled some of our
best advice for the future Class of 2018.

Where to go and when
Looking at the Admit Weekend
schedule with so many different events,
many of which occur simultaneously, it
might be tricky to choose which ones to
attend and how to make the most out of
these three days.

"[You] don't have to feel the pressure
to attend every [event]," said Marcus Al
varez 'l6, an Admit Weekend coordina
tor, adding that ProFros may perceive the
busy schedule as overwhelming. "Go to
the ones that you feel attract you the
most."

Alvarez recommended attending the
a cappella concert (Friday at 8:00 p.m. at
Frost Amphitheater) and the Casino Car
dinale (Thursday night at 9:30 p.m. at the
Frances C. Arrillaga Alumni Center) a
fun casino night, featuring games with
prizes, that provides an opportunity for
ProFros to socialize.

For the more outdoorsy admit, Al
varez suggested hiking the Dish, a trail
through the foothills towards the edge of
campus.

"I feel that a lot of Stanford students

currently haven't hiked the Dish yet I
think that's a really good way to bond
with others," Alvarez said.

Getting around campus
The immensity of the Stanford cam
pus can also be overwhelming, especially
for someone without a bike.

However, a number of University-of
fered tours aim to break down campus in
smaller parts and to help you get to know
the place that you might call home for the
next four years. Tours on offer include
the Bing Concert Hall Tour, Humanities
Tour, Science and Engineering Quad Tour
and even the Stanford Stadium Tour.

Department and residence tours
even allow you to see where you might
study and reside. Other places to visit in
clude the Oval, the Main Quad and its
historical landscape and Memorial
Church with its magnificent mosaic fa
cade.
The Stanford communities
Transitioning to college can present
challenges, according to Alvarez, who re
called encountering a different culture at
Stanford compared to his background.
During his Admit Weekend, Alvarez went
to a First Gen/Low Income Partnership
(FLIP) panel in an effort to find a group
that he felt comfortable with.
"It really changed my life because it
made me feel more like I was home," Al
varez said.
The Activities Fair, which will take
place Friday from 12:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. at
White Plaza, offers one easy way to get to
know Stanford's extracurricular organizations
and student groups.
Friday will also see an LGBTQ Student
Panel and Open House; open houses by
Stanford's diverse ethno-racial groups,
which include the Chicano/Latino, Black,
American Indian, Alaska Native and Native

Hawaiian, and Asian-American communities;
a Multifaith Welcome hosted by religious
groups; a Shabbat dinner hosted by the Jew
ish Student Association on Friday evening;
and a Jumu'ah prayer and an Open House
hosted by the Muslim community at the
Markaz.
Alvarez advised ProFros to develop as
much of an understanding of the campus

community as possible over the course of Ad
mit Weekend.
"My advice to them is to really under
stand the culture here," Alvarez said, "Speak
with a Stanford student one on one more
than a five-minute conversation."
