## FILM A 						look behind the scenes of "Teenage" 
### MADELEINE HAN MARIN REEVE 
Director Matt Wolf has made
waves recently with
"Teenage," a documentary
about the birth and develop
ment of youth culture from
the late 19th century to the
mid-20th century. The film, which
showed at festivals ranging from BFI
London to Tribeca, opens today in
Berkeley and San Francisco. Wolf
spoke with us about generation
gaps, activism and the creation of
"living collage."
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Why
make a documentary about
teenagers?
Matt Wolf (MW): It's based
on a book by Jon Savage. I was a fan
of Jon Savage because he wrote this
book, "England's Dreaming," which

is really the definitive history of
punk. When I heard about his book
"Teenage," I was really intrigued be
cause I'm obsessed with hidden his
tories and forgotten biographies. I
don't see [the documentary] just as
a film about teenagers. I see it as a
film about the secret prehistory of
teenagers and youth culture. We all
think, teenagers, they must have be
gun in the 1950s with James Dean
and rockers and Beatniks. But
there's actually this complex and
unknown prehistory.

What I noticed when I was
reading the book was that Jon's
punk perspective really colored his
depiction of early 20th century his
tory. I thought that was really in
triguing and I thought, 'What if I
tried to make a historical documen
tary that moves away from the Ken

Burns, PBS style of authoritative ex
perts and, instead, does something
that's inspired by that punk sensibility?'
TSD: By punk, do you mean the
spirit of rebellion?
MW: That's an interesting way
to look at it. I think I mean something
a little more specific. Punk is obvious
ly specific music, specific bands in
the 1970s. Early on, when I was try
ing to get to the bottom of the idea of
punk, I was talking to Jon. He said in
the 1970s, he observed young punk
kids taking clothes from previous
generations like rocker suits and zoot
suits, and they'd cut them up and lit
erally reassemble them with safety
pins.
He called that "living collage." I
thought, that's a crazy cool idea for
filmmaking-picking and choosing as
pects from the past... in my case,
clips of footage, voices lifted from
teenage diaries and collaging them
into this living work that's contempo
rary. I think that's what I mean by
punk is this strategy of living collage.
TSD: You've called the documen
tary a "love song to adolescence."
What does that mean?
MW: I think it's celebratory. It's
at once a call to arms and a celebra
tion of the power of youth and the
substance and significance of
teenage rebellion. In a way, I made
this film out of a love for the teenage
subjects that were in it... out of a be
lief that what they did was trailblaz
ing and laid the groundwork for a lot
of the culture and politics that really
inspire me.
TSD: The documentary includes
archival footage and "recreated
portraits." How did you balance
the archival footage with the parts
that you chose to film?
MW: I've used recreations and
fake archival footage before. I
thought it was important to shoot on
16mm to make this footage look like
actual archival footage.
I wanted that device to have a

purpose. For me, it goes back to this
idea of hidden histories and forgotten
biographies. The stories of Brenda
Dean Paul, Melita Maschmann, Tom
mie Scheel and Warren Wall begged
to be told. Those four characters
form a composite portrait of the
teenager that was about to be born. I
thought, those people were never
filmed or photographed. I have to
film them myself.
Otherwise, I wanted the film to
have this living collage feeling. I used
all preexisting material and stuff I
shot that looks like preexisting mate
rial to create that effect.

TSD: The film seems to suggest
social rebellion was the way
teenagers were trying to define
their role in society. Do you see
similar movements today despite
the fact that they've become a
more acknowledged demograph
ic?
MW: I think a lot of the patterns
in the film repeat themselves be
cause there is a generation gap.
There'll probably always be a genera
tion gap where adults are trying to
control youth because they represent
the future and young people are
pushing back trying to create their
own world. That disjunction breeds a
certain type of rebellion.
In terms of recent political and
cultural movements, I look at some
thing like Pussy Riot, which seems re
ally similar to the swing kids, in a
way. I look at the Occupation move
ments and student protest move
ments around the world that are not
youth movements, per se, but that
youth are at the center of because it's
about reimagining a different future
and reversing the mistakes and prob
lems that adults created.
TSD: You mentioned the four
teenagers that you featured in the
film. Did you identify with any
one of them more strongly than
the others?
MW: Tommie Scheel, the Ger
man swing kid, is my favorite be
cause he represents the intersection
and colliding of pop and politics. He's
doing what kids do, he's obsessed
with music and fashion, he likes to
party, but the context and circum

stances in which he's doing it is
deeply political. He's risking his life,
and, in a sense, he's being an activist,
celebrating degenerate culture. I
think that is really powerful and I
could imagine myself being involved
in something like that.
TSD: What were you like as a
teenager?
MW: I was a super politicized
gay teenager. I did a lot of activism in
San Francisco. I grew up in San Jose.
I started Gay Straight Alliance and
would lobby my state representatives
and stuff like that. At the same time,
I was pretty dreamy. I was obsessed
with independent music and under
ground records and I would go to the
movie theater by myself and see all
the independent films. This was like
in the mid '9os. I always had a side of
me that was interested in art and cul
ture that felt alternative and also pol
itics that related to being gay. As an
adult making films, it's about finding
the intersection of those two things.
TSD: You've said before that, as a
teenager, you felt a responsibility
to change the world. Do you think
that that's something that was
particular to that age?
MW: Yes, because I don't neces
sarily feel that way now. As sad as
that might be, I don't feel like I can
change the world because I'm an
adult that's worn down by experi
ence and my thinking's more reality
based. That doesn't mean activism is
n't vital and important. It just means
that, as a teenager, my emotional re
lationship to politics and my role
within history-making was much
more immediate than this role. I real
ly felt like I could change the world
and I don't necessarily feel that as an
adult. I think there is something
about being young, about not being
hindered and burdened by experi
ence, to feel that sense of possibility
and that power. That power is palpa
ble and something can be done with
it.
TSD: Are there are elements of
your teenage self that still reside
with you today?
MW: My main beliefs and val
ues were formed as a teenager, and I

live by them everyday. I think I
changed a lot and the way that those
values and ideals present themselves
evolved over time. I wrote letters to
myself, manifestos, as a teenager that
basically outlined exactly what I be
lieve in and what I do today. I have a
feeling that a lot of people form some
of their core beliefs at that time in
their lives.
TSD: This documentary captures
that energy and importance of
what it's like being a teenager and
forming those values. Do you
think filmmaking or art in general
gives you a space to hold onto
that?
MW: I think being an artist is an
opportunity to ask complicated ques
tions you don't necessarily have an
swers to and to speak in languages
that you've never spoken in before,
that maybe nobody's spoken in be
fore. A lot of times, people don't
want to ask questions or people want
answers to the questions that they

have. Living with ambiguity and un
certainty and abstraction is some
thing artists are good at.
TSD: What do you hope that audi
ences who watch the film will
gain from it?
MW: A different attitude about
youth, a sense that something very
old can feel very new and that the
past can be instructive about the
present. The through line for me of
the film is about teenage rebellion,
that it's not just an emotional rite of
passage, that there's real political
substance to it, that it can lead to
wards change, that it's catalyzing,
that young people play a significant
role. We shouldn't get older and then
one day look at youth and say, they're
not as creative or interesting as we
were, they're all just conformists, be
cause that's what everybody does
when they get old.

of the culture and politics that really
inspire me.
TSD: The documentary includes
archival footage and "recreated
portraits." How did you balance
the archival footage with the parts
that you chose to film?
MW: I've used recreations and
fake archival footage before. I
thought it was important to shoot on
16mm to make this footage look like
actual archival footage.
I wanted that device to have a

purpose. For me, it goes back to this
idea of hidden histories and forgotten
biographies. The stories of Brenda
Dean Paul, Melita Maschmann, Tom
mie Scheel and Warren Wall begged
to be told. Those four characters
form a composite portrait of the
teenager that was about to be born. I
thought, those people were never
filmed or photographed. I have to
film them myself.
Otherwise, I wanted the film to
have this living collage feeling. I used
all preexisting material and stuff I
shot that looks like preexisting mate
rial to create that effect.

TSD: The film seems to suggest
social rebellion was the way
teenagers were trying to define
their role in society. Do you see
similar movements today despite
the fact that they've become a
more acknowledged demograph
ic?
MW: I think a lot of the patterns
in the film repeat themselves be
cause there is a generation gap.
There'll probably always be a genera
tion gap where adults are trying to
control youth because they represent
the future and young people are
pushing back trying to create their
own world. That disjunction breeds a
certain type of rebellion.
In terms of recent political and
cultural movements, I look at some
thing like Pussy Riot, which seems re
ally similar to the swing kids, in a
way. I look at the Occupation move
ments and student protest move
ments around the world that are not
youth movements, per se, but that
youth are at the center of because it's
about reimagining a different future
and reversing the mistakes and prob
lems that adults created.
TSD: You mentioned the four
teenagers that you featured in the
film. Did you identify with any
one of them more strongly than
the others?
MW: Tommie Scheel, the Ger
man swing kid, is my favorite be
cause he represents the intersection
and colliding of pop and politics. He's
doing what kids do, he's obsessed
with music and fashion, he likes to
party, but the context and circum

stances in which he's doing it is
deeply political. He's risking his life,
and, in a sense, he's being an activist,
celebrating degenerate culture. I
think that is really powerful and I
could imagine myself being involved
in something like that.
TSD: What were you like as a
teenager?
MW: I was a super politicized
gay teenager. I did a lot of activism in
San Francisco. I grew up in San Jose.
I started Gay Straight Alliance and
would lobby my state representatives
and stuff like that. At the same time,
I was pretty dreamy. I was obsessed
with independent music and under
ground records and I would go to the
movie theater by myself and see all
the independent films. This was like
in the mid '9os. I always had a side of
me that was interested in art and cul
ture that felt alternative and also pol
itics that related to being gay. As an
adult making films, it's about finding
the intersection of those two things.
TSD: You've said before that, as a
teenager, you felt a responsibility
to change the world. Do you think
that that's something that was
particular to that age?
MW: Yes, because I don't neces
sarily feel that way now. As sad as
that might be, I don't feel like I can
change the world because I'm an
adult that's worn down by experi
ence and my thinking's more reality
based. That doesn't mean activism is
n't vital and important. It just means
that, as a teenager, my emotional re
lationship to politics and my role
within history-making was much
more immediate than this role. I real
ly felt like I could change the world
and I don't necessarily feel that as an
adult. I think there is something
about being young, about not being
hindered and burdened by experi
ence, to feel that sense of possibility
and that power. That power is palpa
ble and something can be done with
it.
TSD: Are there are elements of
your teenage self that still reside
with you today?
MW: My main beliefs and val
ues were formed as a teenager, and I

live by them everyday. I think I
changed a lot and the way that those
values and ideals present themselves
evolved over time. I wrote letters to
myself, manifestos, as a teenager that
basically outlined exactly what I be
lieve in and what I do today. I have a
feeling that a lot of people form some
of their core beliefs at that time in
their lives.
TSD: This documentary captures
that energy and importance of
what it's like being a teenager and
forming those values. Do you
think filmmaking or art in general
gives you a space to hold onto
that?
MW: I think being an artist is an
opportunity to ask complicated ques
tions you don't necessarily have an
swers to and to speak in languages
that you've never spoken in before,
that maybe nobody's spoken in be
fore. A lot of times, people don't
want to ask questions or people want
answers to the questions that they

have. Living with ambiguity and un
certainty and abstraction is some
thing artists are good at.
TSD: What do you hope that audi
ences who watch the film will
gain from it?
MW: A different attitude about
youth, a sense that something very
old can feel very new and that the
past can be instructive about the
present. The through line for me of
the film is about teenage rebellion,
that it's not just an emotional rite of
passage, that there's real political
substance to it, that it can lead to
wards change, that it's catalyzing,
that young people play a significant
role. We shouldn't get older and then
one day look at youth and say, they're
not as creative or interesting as we
were, they're all just conformists, be
cause that's what everybody does
when they get old.

Director Matt Wolf has made
waves recently with
"Teenage," a documentary
about the birth and develop
ment of youth culture from
the late 19th century to the
mid-20th century. The film, which
showed at festivals ranging from BFI
London to Tribeca, opens today in
Berkeley and San Francisco. Wolf
spoke with us about generation
gaps, activism and the creation of
"living collage."
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Why
make a documentary about
teenagers?
Matt Wolf (MW): It's based
on a book by Jon Savage. I was a fan
of Jon Savage because he wrote this
book, "England's Dreaming," which

is really the definitive history of
punk. When I heard about his book
"Teenage," I was really intrigued be
cause I'm obsessed with hidden his
tories and forgotten biographies. I
don't see [the documentary] just as
a film about teenagers. I see it as a
film about the secret prehistory of
teenagers and youth culture. We all
think, teenagers, they must have be
gun in the 1950s with James Dean
and rockers and Beatniks. But
there's actually this complex and
unknown prehistory.

What I noticed when I was
reading the book was that Jon's
punk perspective really colored his
depiction of early 20th century his
tory. I thought that was really in
triguing and I thought, 'What if I
tried to make a historical documen
tary that moves away from the Ken

Burns, PBS style of authoritative ex
perts and, instead, does something
that's inspired by that punk sensibility?'
TSD: By punk, do you mean the
spirit of rebellion?
MW: That's an interesting way
to look at it. I think I mean something
a little more specific. Punk is obvious
ly specific music, specific bands in
the 1970s. Early on, when I was try
ing to get to the bottom of the idea of
punk, I was talking to Jon. He said in
the 1970s, he observed young punk
kids taking clothes from previous
generations like rocker suits and zoot
suits, and they'd cut them up and lit
erally reassemble them with safety
pins.
He called that "living collage." I
thought, that's a crazy cool idea for
filmmaking-picking and choosing as
pects from the past... in my case,
clips of footage, voices lifted from
teenage diaries and collaging them
into this living work that's contempo
rary. I think that's what I mean by
punk is this strategy of living collage.
TSD: You've called the documen
tary a "love song to adolescence."
What does that mean?
MW: I think it's celebratory. It's
at once a call to arms and a celebra
tion of the power of youth and the
substance and significance of
teenage rebellion. In a way, I made
this film out of a love for the teenage
subjects that were in it... out of a be
lief that what they did was trailblaz
ing and laid the groundwork for a lot
of the culture and politics that really
inspire me.

in the mid '9os. I always had a side of
me that was interested in art and cul
ture that felt alternative and also pol
itics that related to being gay. As an
adult making films, it's about finding
the intersection of those two things.
TSD: You've said before that, as a
teenager, you felt a responsibility
to change the world. Do you think
that that's something that was
particular to that age?
MW: Yes, because I don't neces
sarily feel that way now. As sad as
that might be, I don't feel like I can
change the world because I'm an
adult that's worn down by experi
ence and my thinking's more reality
based. That doesn't mean activism is
n't vital and important. It just means
that, as a teenager, my emotional re
lationship to politics and my role
within history-making was much
more immediate than this role. I real
ly felt like I could change the world
and I don't necessarily feel that as an
adult. I think there is something
about being young, about not being
hindered and burdened by experi
ence, to feel that sense of possibility
and that power. That power is palpa
ble and something can be done with
it.
TSD: Are there are elements of
your teenage self that still reside
with you today?
MW: My main beliefs and val
ues were formed as a teenager, and I

live by them everyday. I think I
changed a lot and the way that those
values and ideals present themselves
evolved over time. I wrote letters to
myself, manifestos, as a teenager that
basically outlined exactly what I be
lieve in and what I do today. I have a
feeling that a lot of people form some
of their core beliefs at that time in
their lives.
TSD: This documentary captures
that energy and importance of
what it's like being a teenager and
forming those values. Do you
think filmmaking or art in general
gives you a space to hold onto
that?
MW: I think being an artist is an
opportunity to ask complicated ques
tions you don't necessarily have an
swers to and to speak in languages
that you've never spoken in before,
that maybe nobody's spoken in be
fore. A lot of times, people don't
want to ask questions or people want
answers to the questions that they

have. Living with ambiguity and un
certainty and abstraction is some
thing artists are good at.
TSD: What do you hope that audi
ences who watch the film will
gain from it?
MW: A different attitude about
youth, a sense that something very
old can feel very new and that the
past can be instructive about the
present. The through line for me of
the film is about teenage rebellion,
that it's not just an emotional rite of
passage, that there's real political
substance to it, that it can lead to
wards change, that it's catalyzing,
that young people play a significant
role. We shouldn't get older and then
one day look at youth and say, they're
not as creative or interesting as we
were, they're all just conformists, be
cause that's what everybody does
when they get old.

Director Matt Wolf has made
waves recently with
"Teenage," a documentary
about the birth and develop
ment of youth culture from
the late 19th century to the
mid-20th century. The film, which
showed at festivals ranging from BFI
London to Tribeca, opens today in
Berkeley and San Francisco. Wolf
spoke with us about generation
gaps, activism and the creation of
"living collage."
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Why
make a documentary about
teenagers?
Matt Wolf (MW): It's based
on a book by Jon Savage. I was a fan
of Jon Savage because he wrote this
book, "England's Dreaming," which

is really the definitive history of
punk. When I heard about his book
"Teenage," I was really intrigued be
cause I'm obsessed with hidden his
tories and forgotten biographies. I
don't see [the documentary] just as
a film about teenagers. I see it as a
film about the secret prehistory of
teenagers and youth culture. We all
think, teenagers, they must have be
gun in the 1950s with James Dean
and rockers and Beatniks. But
there's actually this complex and
unknown prehistory.

What I noticed when I was
reading the book was that Jon's
punk perspective really colored his
depiction of early 20th century his
tory. I thought that was really in
triguing and I thought, 'What if I
tried to make a historical documen
tary that moves away from the Ken

Burns, PBS style of authoritative ex
perts and, instead, does something
that's inspired by that punk sensibility?'
TSD: By punk, do you mean the
spirit of rebellion?
MW: That's an interesting way
to look at it. I think I mean something
a little more specific. Punk is obvious
ly specific music, specific bands in
the 1970s. Early on, when I was try
ing to get to the bottom of the idea of
punk, I was talking to Jon. He said in
the 1970s, he observed young punk
kids taking clothes from previous
generations like rocker suits and zoot
suits, and they'd cut them up and lit
erally reassemble them with safety
pins.
He called that "living collage." I
thought, that's a crazy cool idea for
filmmaking-picking and choosing as
pects from the past... in my case,
clips of footage, voices lifted from
teenage diaries and collaging them
into this living work that's contempo
rary. I think that's what I mean by
punk is this strategy of living collage.
TSD: You've called the documen
tary a "love song to adolescence."
What does that mean?
MW: I think it's celebratory. It's
at once a call to arms and a celebra
tion of the power of youth and the
substance and significance of
teenage rebellion. In a way, I made
this film out of a love for the teenage
subjects that were in it... out of a be
lief that what they did was trailblaz
ing and laid the groundwork for a lot
of the culture and politics that really
inspire me.
TSD: The documentary includes
archival footage and "recreated
portraits." How did you balance
the archival footage with the parts
that you chose to film?
MW: I've used recreations and
fake archival footage before. I
thought it was important to shoot on
16mm to make this footage look like
actual archival footage.
I wanted that device to have a

purpose. For me, it goes back to this
idea of hidden histories and forgotten
biographies. The stories of Brenda
Dean Paul, Melita Maschmann, Tom
mie Scheel and Warren Wall begged
to be told. Those four characters
form a composite portrait of the
teenager that was about to be born. I
thought, those people were never
filmed or photographed. I have to
film them myself.
Otherwise, I wanted the film to
have this living collage feeling. I used
all preexisting material and stuff I
shot that looks like preexisting mate
rial to create that effect.

TSD: The film seems to suggest
social rebellion was the way
teenagers were trying to define
their role in society. Do you see
similar movements today despite
the fact that they've become a
more acknowledged demograph
ic?
MW: I think a lot of the patterns
in the film repeat themselves be
cause there is a generation gap.
There'll probably always be a genera
tion gap where adults are trying to
control youth because they represent
the future and young people are
pushing back trying to create their
own world. That disjunction breeds a
certain type of rebellion.
In terms of recent political and
cultural movements, I look at some
thing like Pussy Riot, which seems re
ally similar to the swing kids, in a
way. I look at the Occupation move
ments and student protest move
ments around the world that are not
youth movements, per se, but that
youth are at the center of because it's
about reimagining a different future
and reversing the mistakes and prob
lems that adults created.
TSD: You mentioned the four
teenagers that you featured in the
film. Did you identify with any
one of them more strongly than
the others?
MW: Tommie Scheel, the Ger
man swing kid, is my favorite be
cause he represents the intersection
and colliding of pop and politics. He's
doing what kids do, he's obsessed
with music and fashion, he likes to
party, but the context and circum

stances in which he's doing it is
deeply political. He's risking his life,
and, in a sense, he's being an activist,
celebrating degenerate culture. I
think that is really powerful and I
could imagine myself being involved
in something like that.
TSD: What were you like as a
teenager?
MW: I was a super politicized
gay teenager. I did a lot of activism in
San Francisco. I grew up in San Jose.
I started Gay Straight Alliance and
would lobby my state representatives
and stuff like that. At the same time,
I was pretty dreamy. I was obsessed
with independent music and under
ground records and I would go to the
movie theater by myself and see all
the independent films. This was like
in the mid '9os. I always had a side of
me that was interested in art and cul
ture that felt alternative and also pol
itics that related to being gay. As an
