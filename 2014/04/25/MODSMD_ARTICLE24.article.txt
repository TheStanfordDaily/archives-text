# KAI KIGHT TAKES CENTER STAGE
## STANFORD SENIOR PLAYS VIOLIN AT RING 
### NOEMI BERKOWITZ 
Following on the heels of Kai
Kight 'l4's recent perform
ance at Bing Concert Hall,
The Daily sat down with
the senior product design
major to talk about his mu
sic, his inspirations and the broad
er impact his work offers.
Kight has been playing violin
since the age of three, but he still
finds new elements in his music on
a daily basis. That's because, in the
past few years, he has started writ
ing his own compositions. And al
most every time he comes back to
them, he finds something new.

"I feel like it's a constant devel
opment of ideas," Kight explained.
"It's very difficult for me to say
something is finished because I feel
like where a composition is... is just
a point in time or a certain mindset
that you were in."
Those mindsets may change,
or new ideas may strike him as he
plays in new settings. He will also
revise pieces for new venues, like
the music he just played while
opening for the Aeolus String Quar
tet at Bing Concert Hall on April 6.

So what are the ideas he's de
veloping? Kight takes his inspira
tion from two primary - and quite
contrasting— sources: Bach and
contemporary popular music.
Since he composes primarily for
the solo violin, he works to achieve
a fuller sound by taking inspiration
from Bach.
"He did so much on the violin
that wasn't done before, like four
part harmony on one instrument,"
Kight emphasized, noting that he
strives to incorporate those har
monies into his own compositions.
Kight is interested, however, in
keeping his music innovative by
combining Bach-like harmonies
with rhythms he takes from elec
tronic music or dubstep. The two
don't seem like an intuitive combi
nation, but that may be exactly why

it works so well. His performances
are certainly in demand — he's
performed at Bing Concert Hall,
TEDxStanford and Stanford+Con
nects, and is eager to do more.
For his senior project, Kight
has sought to combine speech with
his music to "to inspire people to
think differently about the world
we're living in or the project they're
working on." He wants to give pre

sentations for enterprises, teaching
them ideas about creativity and
leadership.
"Essentially, I'd be turning mu
sic into insights," he explained as he
described his vision for the project.
His speech at Stanford+Con
nects elaborated further on the
type of insights he aims to open up
