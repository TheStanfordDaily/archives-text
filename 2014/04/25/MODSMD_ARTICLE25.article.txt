# GIA COPPOLA'S DIRECTORIAL DEBUT EXPLORES YOUTH CULTURE IN THE BAY AREA
## PALO ALTO 
### MADELEINE HAN 
M M alo Alto," a film by Gia Coppo-
I I la, plays like a solemn love
to teenagedom. Based
on James Franco's "Palo Alto
Stories," the film follows
three suburban teenagers:
Teddy (Jack Kilmer), April (Emma Roberts)
and Fred (Nat Wolff).
The film is a hazy montage of the teens'
day-to-day escapades, which range from
serving probation, to attending alcohol-fused
parties, to jump-starting a relationship with a
much-older soccer coach — played by
James Franco all set to an indie-dream
soundtrack composed by Blood Orange (De
vonte Hynes) and Coppola herself.
Underscoring shots of Teddy driving

down his neighborhood's lamp-lit streets
and April balancing a cigarette between
her fingers is the palpable weight of real
ism. Coppola does not judge: she ob
serves her characters, giving them
even the minor ones — enough screen
time to develop and to unveil, hidden in
the lull of the mundane, the beautiful,
woeful and sui generis intensity of youth.

"Palo Alto" screens at the San Francis
co International Film Festival on May
3 at 7:3OPM at the Sundance Kabuki
in San Francisco. Director Gia Coppo
la will be in attendance. The film hits
theaters on May 16.
