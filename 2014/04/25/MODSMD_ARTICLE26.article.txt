# Coachella comes to a close
## Last weekend of Coachella features breakout artists and standout performances 
### MINNA XIAO 
Set against the picturesque backdrop
of watercolor paint-thin mountain sil
houettes, requisite palm trees and
massive art installations, the Coachel
la Valley Music and Arts Festival's
second weekend was an elaborate,
well-produced affair. Featuring less hype and
celebrity appearances than the first week
end, the final three-day leg of the annual ex
travaganza nevertheless had well-rehearsed
acts and a relaxed atmosphere.
In a festival abounding with breakout
artists and established legends, acts such as
Haim, Capital Cities, Lorde, Pharrell and
Daughter gave some of the standout per
formances.
Haim
"We've been to every one for the past
10 years," the Haim sisters informed the
crowd about their past Coachella atten
dance, adding that it was crazy for them to
be actually playing it for the first time this
April. Their unadulterated enthusiasm was
immediately palpable when the three Los
Angeles natives Danielle, Este and
Alana Haim took to the Outdoor The
atre Friday and opened with "Falling," the
first track off their pitch-perfect debut al
bum "Days Are Gone."
Haim performed with ferocious intensi
ty, giving a delicious new edge to "Days Are
Gone" tracks such as "Honey & I," "My Song
5," "If I Could Change Your Mind," as well as
larger pop-rock hits "Forever" and "The
Wire." In recorded form, these come off as
almost a little too slickly produced. As the sis
ter trio showcased their formidable guitar
skills and indulged in a fiery percussion jam
session to close out their act, however, there
was little doubt in the audience that these
girls could really rock out.
Capital Cities
The Los Angeles duo best known for
their 2013 hit single "Safe and Sound"

pulled off a remarkably polished and addic
tive set for a high-energy crowd Saturday
evening. Dressed in matching, garish flower
patterned suits, the indie-pop rockers and
their live band opened with an animated,
dance-happy rendition of "Kangaroo Court,"
led by the smooth vocals of singer Ryan Mer
chant.
Capital Cities' infectiously breezy synth
pop sound proved an excellent fit for the out
door arena, inspiring an impressive and con
sistent level of audience engagement
throughout its 50-minute act. The band per
formed a slew of glimmering electro jams
from its debut album "In A Tidal Wave Of
Mystery," including "Farrah Fawcett Flair," "I
Sold My Bed, But Not My Stereo," "Char
treuse" and "One Minute More" while mas
terfully blending in covers of the Bees Gees'
"Stayin' Alive" and Prince's "Nothing Com
pares 2 U."
Lorde
Seventeen-year-old songstress Lorde ce
mented her rise to pop stardom with a
sweeping 45-minute performance of her
chart-topping "Pure Heroine" debut, opening
with "Glory and Gore" before launching into
"Ribs," proclaiming her reluctance towards
growing up to an audience that was largely
older than she.
Abetted by her characteristically exuber
ant dance moves and hypnotic vocals, Lorde
worked the euphoric and ever-expanding
crowd into a frenzy with superb performanc
es of her popular tracks including "Tennis
Court," "Buzzcut Season," "Team," and of
course, her smash hit "Royals."
Pharrell Williams
On Saturday night, Pharrell drew mas
sive crowds to the Outdoor Theatre. The pro
ducer-singer-rapper was in all his chart-top
ping, hit-churning glory before headliner
Muse took to the Coachella Stage later that
night.
After a star-studded Weekend One guest
roster that included Nelly, Snoop Dogg and

Gwen Stefani, Pharrell managed to up the
ante with his second appearance, bringing
out T.I. to perform the mammoth summer
hit "Blurred Lines," Pusha T for Clipse's
"Grindin," Busta Rhymes for "Pass the Cour
voisier Part II" and Usher for "U Don't Have
to Call."

The biggest surprise of the night, howev
er, was an extended appearance by Jay-Z,
who joined Pharrell and his fedora on
stage, for performances of "Frontin'," "Ex
cuse Me Miss," "La La La (Excuse Me Miss
Again)" and "I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2
Me)."

In his 60-minute set, Pharrell performed
major crowd-pleasers like "Get Lucky,"
slipped in N.E.R.D hits, and selected tracks
from his latest solo album effort, GIRL.
"I don't know what you're on, but I hope
it's happy," he crooned to the audience, be
fore closing out his performance with a jubi
lant rendition of his Billboard-topping "Hap
py" amid a torrent of confetti.

Daughter
The European indie rock band Daughter,
comprised of vocalist Elena Tonra, guitarist
Igor Haefeli and drummer Remi Aguilella,
possesses a brooding, ambient sound height
ened by Elena's diaphanous vocals and bleak,
stripped-down lyrics.
On the festival's closing night, Daugh
ter's emotional, translucent style could seem
to some almost out of place as they graced
the stage of the Mojave Tent: The ground
shaking, bass-thumping strains of EDM were
bleeding in from the neighboring Sahara
Tent, and most festivalgoers were still antici
pating the night's two largest final acts
electronic dance superstars Disclosure and
anthem-rock headliner Arcade Fire.

The evening set time, however, paired
with the stage's smoke and subtle lighting,
created the perfect atmosphere for the
band's bone-chilling, intimate melodies.
