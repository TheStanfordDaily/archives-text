## ProFros overflow dorms Upperclassman dorms hosting ProFros lack energy 
### GEORGE CHEN EDITOR IN CHIEF 
Though upperclassman dorms
housing prospective freshmen
(ProFros) over Admit Weekend have
scheduled dorm-specific activities
aimed at creating a more welcoming
atmosphere, the number of room
hosts (RoHos) in participating non
freshman dorms remains low.

The Admit Weekend experi
ence is generally different for
ProFros assigned to stay in an upper
classman dorm instead of a fresh
man or four-class dorm. Head house
hosts (HoHos) for upperclassmen
face challenges in generating a
sense of community and excite
ment for ProFros due to the large
sizes of non-freshman dorm such as
Crothers, Toyon and Kimball, as well
as less involvement from upper
classman dorm residents, according
to Alejandro Ruizesparza' 16, one of
three HoHos in Crothers.

"Being in an upperclassman
dorm like Crothers that's so big

it already lacks a community I
think that can be hard on ProFros,"
said Maggie Cremin 'l6, another
Crothers HoHo. "The lack of an ex
isting community makes it harder
for ProFros to talk to students and other
ProFros if doors are closed and the dorm is
quieter."
Ellen Hong' 17, who stayed in the upper
classman dorm Kimball during last year's Ad
mit Weekend, said she doesn't remember Kim
ball offering any dorm programming the entire
weekend the only dorm-specific activity she
participated in was an event held at Stern
and also recalled that most of the upperclass
men kept to themselves. Looking back at her
Admit Weekend experience, she said she
wishes she had stayed in a freshman dorm.

"Admit Weekend made me scared about
going to Stanford," Hong said. "I was set on
going to Stanford, but if I was choosing be
tween Stanford and another school, staying
at an upperclassman dorm would have defi
nitely pushed me towards going to a differ
ent school."

Ramona Malczynski 'l4, who served as
a Crothers HoHo for Admit Weekend two
years ago, said that while the overall experi
ence had been positive for ProFros staying
at Crothers, she found it difficult to organ
ize events in a large dorm, a challenge that
was worsened by the fact that there were
only two HoHos between Crothers and
Crothers Memorial.

Malczynski contrasted her HoHo expe
rience in Crothers unfavorably with her Ro-
Ho experience in the four-class dorm Carde
nal, where specific activities were held to
promote interactions among ProFros and
between ProFros and RoHos.
In an effort to address the lack of activ
ities in upperclassman dorms, the Crothers
FioHos this year have organized Crothers
specific sleepovers in the main lounge and a
GeoCache scavenger hunt in which
Crothers ProFros are tasked to find hidden
items around campus.
Ruizesparza and Cremin admitted,
however, that convincing unenthused up
perclassman residents to serve as RoFios
the limiting factor in determining how
many ProFros a dorm like Crothers can
house has been a difficult process.
"A lot of [upperclassmen] are just doing
their own things," Ruizesparza said. "They
have their own groups of friends and hang
out. They're just in a different place, and it's
hard to get them all together [for Admit
Weekend]."
This weekend, eight registered ProFros
are housed in Toyon and about 30 are

housed in Crothers, compared to the 50 to
60 ProFros who stay at each of the freshman
and four-class dorms on East Campus, ac
cording to a freshman dorm RA.
Cremin also expressed concerns about
upperclassman dorms staying alcohol-free
during Admit Weekend, explaining that it is
easier for a FioHo to encourage residents in
a freshman dorm where there is a more
tight-knit community —to follow Admit
Weekend's dry policy than it is in an upper
classman dorm.

Ruizesparza noted that there are some

benefits for ProFros assigned to non-fresh
man dorms, as they can draw valuable infor
mation such as advice on upper-level cours
es and career pathways from upperclass
men.

Malczynski, who is a RoHo in Cardenal
again this year, said she believes that she is
in a much better position to be giving advice
to ProFros as a senior now than when she
was a freshman. ProFros staying at an upper
classman dorm could also get a better sense
of what everyday life, outside of the excite
ment of freshman year, is like at Stanford, ac

cording to Malczynski.
Despite those benefits, however, creat
ing an atmosphere in an upperclassman dorm
that is as exciting as that in a freshman dorm
remains difficult.
"It would be better if Stanford tried to
get everyone into a freshman dorm," Hong
said. "[Freshmen] are more excited about
hosting ProFros than upperclassmen who just
kind of have to take ProFros."

Welcome, the official welcome speech given to the admitted Class of 2018 by Dean Richard Shaw and Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. '82.
Though upperclassman dorms
housing prospective freshmen
(ProFros) over Admit Weekend have
scheduled dorm-specific activities
aimed at creating a more welcoming
atmosphere, the number of room
hosts (RoHos) in participating non
freshman dorms remains low.

The Admit Weekend experi
ence is generally different for
ProFros assigned to stay in an upper
classman dorm instead of a fresh
man or four-class dorm. Head house
hosts (HoHos) for upperclassmen
face challenges in generating a
sense of community and excite
ment for ProFros due to the large
sizes of non-freshman dorm such as
Crothers, Toyon and Kimball, as well
as less involvement from upper
classman dorm residents, according
to Alejandro Ruizesparza' 16, one of
three HoHos in Crothers.

"Being in an upperclassman
dorm like Crothers that's so big

it already lacks a community I
think that can be hard on ProFros,"
said Maggie Cremin 'l6, another
Crothers HoHo. "The lack of an ex
isting community makes it harder
for ProFros to talk to students and other
ProFros if doors are closed and the dorm is
quieter."
Ellen Hong' 17, who stayed in the upper
classman dorm Kimball during last year's Ad
mit Weekend, said she doesn't remember Kim
ball offering any dorm programming the entire
weekend the only dorm-specific activity she
participated in was an event held at Stern
and also recalled that most of the upperclass
men kept to themselves. Looking back at her
Admit Weekend experience, she said she
wishes she had stayed in a freshman dorm.

"Admit Weekend made me scared about
going to Stanford," Hong said. "I was set on
going to Stanford, but if I was choosing be
tween Stanford and another school, staying
at an upperclassman dorm would have defi
nitely pushed me towards going to a differ
ent school."

Ramona Malczynski 'l4, who served as
a Crothers HoHo for Admit Weekend two
years ago, said that while the overall experi
ence had been positive for ProFros staying
at Crothers, she found it difficult to organ
ize events in a large dorm, a challenge that
was worsened by the fact that there were
only two HoHos between Crothers and
Crothers Memorial.

Malczynski contrasted her HoHo expe
rience in Crothers unfavorably with her Ro-
Ho experience in the four-class dorm Carde
nal, where specific activities were held to
promote interactions among ProFros and
between ProFros and RoHos.
In an effort to address the lack of activ
ities in upperclassman dorms, the Crothers
FioHos this year have organized Crothers
specific sleepovers in the main lounge and a
GeoCache scavenger hunt in which
Crothers ProFros are tasked to find hidden
items around campus.
Ruizesparza and Cremin admitted,
however, that convincing unenthused up
perclassman residents to serve as RoFios
the limiting factor in determining how
many ProFros a dorm like Crothers can
house has been a difficult process.
"A lot of [upperclassmen] are just doing
their own things," Ruizesparza said. "They
have their own groups of friends and hang
out. They're just in a different place, and it's
hard to get them all together [for Admit
Weekend]."
This weekend, eight registered ProFros
are housed in Toyon and about 30 are

housed in Crothers, compared to the 50 to
60 ProFros who stay at each of the freshman
and four-class dorms on East Campus, ac
cording to a freshman dorm RA.
Cremin also expressed concerns about
upperclassman dorms staying alcohol-free
during Admit Weekend, explaining that it is
easier for a FioHo to encourage residents in
a freshman dorm where there is a more
tight-knit community —to follow Admit
Weekend's dry policy than it is in an upper
classman dorm.

Ruizesparza noted that there are some

benefits for ProFros assigned to non-fresh
man dorms, as they can draw valuable infor
mation such as advice on upper-level cours
es and career pathways from upperclass
men.

Malczynski, who is a RoHo in Cardenal
again this year, said she believes that she is
in a much better position to be giving advice
to ProFros as a senior now than when she
was a freshman. ProFros staying at an upper
classman dorm could also get a better sense
of what everyday life, outside of the excite
ment of freshman year, is like at Stanford, ac

cording to Malczynski.
Despite those benefits, however, creat
ing an atmosphere in an upperclassman dorm
that is as exciting as that in a freshman dorm
remains difficult.
"It would be better if Stanford tried to
get everyone into a freshman dorm," Hong
said. "[Freshmen] are more excited about
hosting ProFros than upperclassmen who just
kind of have to take ProFros."
