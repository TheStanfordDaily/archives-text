financial aid, recently announced the class of
2018 admitted students. A record number of
42,167 students applied —an increase of
8.6 percent over last year. Admission was of
fered to 5.07 percent of the applicants. The
Daily spoke with Dean Shaw about the ad
missions process and trends.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): Is Stanford look
ing for well-rounded students or students fo
cused on a specific passion?

you'll find hundreds of books written on how

to get in. We're trying to find stu
dents. There are no absolutes. The
bottom line is we try to identify
students who we sense [have] a sig
nificant love of learning and pas
sion for whatever they do.

The common denominator is
you have to be doing well in school
with academic work that you've
done and types of courses you've
taken. That's the springboard we
use to move into the rest of the
story.

They all have a shot at consid
eration and we treat their applica
tions with extraordinary respect.
We try to find the characteristics
that suggest they have an incredi
ble motivation to engage in the way
they live their lives and the way
they do their work. It's more than
just meeting certain quantitative
markers.

We use the term "intellectual
vitality." But it's vitality for any
thing they engage in. So usually the
students who make it through this
review will present to us some sig
nificant success that reflects a pas
sion for what they do.

TSD: How many staff members do
you have in the office reviewing
the applications?
RS: We have about 40 people read
ing they're not all full-time offi
cers. We hire a number of outside
readers, and many of them are re
turning every year and they con
tribute to the reading process.

TSD: How many hours collectively
go into reviewing these applica
tions?

RS: If you averaged the number of
students in a 15-minute reading,
some are longer and some are
shorter: 42,000 divided by four
would be the number of hours in
the first read. Then you'd have to
add the substantial number of stu
dents who make it through second
and third reads it's quite an in
tense program. It's 24/7 for about
three months.

TSD: With the number of appli
cants at an all-time high, have there
been any shifts in the types of stu
dents accepted this year compared
to previous years?
RS: This year, we're seeing a nice
spike in the humanities in this class
and we're pleased about that. It's

about creating awareness of what
the programs and opportunities are
at Stanford. So it does have a lot to
do with the public perceptions but
it also has to do with outreach we
do.

We are often tied into the
community in which we live and
the Silicon Valley is fairly techno
logically well known throughout
the country. So the fastest-growing
areas have been technology, but
that's been turning around and
we're going to see that change in
the next few years.

TSD: Do you expect any changes
in the number of students Stanford
accepts?
RS: We've been hovering around
1,700 —this year 1,670 but
we do see in the future over a pe
riod of time some growth, and
[Stanford President John Hen
nessey] mentioned that himself.
We won't grow [the student body]
unless we can put the kind of re
sources behind that growth to en
sure that the kind of quality educa
tion a Stanford student receives to
day will be the same, which means
building new residence halls and
possibly hiring new faculty.

TSD: As Stanford's dean of admis
sion and financial aid for almost 10
years and as the former dean of ad
missions at Yale University, what
has been the biggest challenge in
the admissions process?

RS: No doubt it would be the vol
ume. The volume in recent years has
really gone up pretty precipitously.

TSD: Will interviews be incorpo
rated more in the admissions
process?
RS: Interviews are not required
but many students take advantage
of them. We've had a pilot program
going on for three years, and now
we've formalized it for the last two
and we're growing it slowly. It al
lows us to have them reflect on
their candidacy with alumni
throughout the years... There will
come a time when we will be inter
viewing the vast majority of stu
dents who are interested in apply
ing to Stanford.

TSD: Stanford had an 8.6-percent
increase in applicants this year,
more than twice the average in
crease of other top schools. What
do you think makes Stanford so at
tractive to prospective students?
RS: That's a great question. I just
think we've been discovered.
We're on the West Coast the
rest of the country has woken up
to the fact that that Stanford is an
amazing place to pursue your high
er education.

We're in the news all the time
around the nation both in terms of
our academic and intellectual out
comes. Nobel Laureates, Pulitzer
Prize winners, Rose Bowl, national
basketball Final Four this is a
place where excellence pervades
the institution.

The weather definitely helps.
If you come from places where you
have 10 snowstorms a year, you
sort of go, 'This is kind of pleasant
out here.'
