## Stanford boosts arts focus 
### NITISH KULKARNI DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's ascendancy to
the pantheon of higher educa
tion is most commonly linked to
the University's prowess in tech
nical disciplines. Less heralded,
however, are Stanford's pro
grams in the arts and humani
ties, even as the University con
tinues to make great leaps for
ward in those fields.
Matthew Tiews, executive
director of arts programs, ex
plained that Stanford had
mounted a concerted push to
balance out the University's of
ferings and the recognition af
forded them.
"All of this is part of, as you
say, a real, dedicated push by the
University," Tiews said. "It start
ed with the Stanford Arts Initia
tive back in 2006, one of the big
platforms that the University
wanted to address."
The Stanford Arts Institute
serves as an organizational and
umbrella group of sorts for many
arts and humanities initiatives at
Stanford. Stephen Hinton, a pro
fessor of music theory and the
faculty director of the Stanford
Arts Institute, noted that the in
stitute has launched a number of
programs throughout its short
life to date.
"The arts initiative was one
of several initiatives that the
University launched at the time,
as a part of the Stanford Chal
lenge," Hinton explained. "The
idea was that no one department
or school could really take own
ership of the initiatives, because
the initiative required people
coming together from different

disciplines."
Students acknowledged the
impact of this effort to increase
focus on the arts.

Paula Salazar 'l3, the Uni
versity's arts in student life coor
dinator for the University, ex
plained that arts programs have
increased in intensity and quan
tity during her time at Stanford.

"I knew that there were art
programs, but I think that in the
time since my freshman year,
arts programs have definitely ex
ploded on campus," Salazar said.

She recalled that one of her
greatest undergraduate experi
ences was her participation in
Stanford's Arts Immersion Pro
gram in New York during spring
break of her sophomore year, a
program that is now run by her
office.

"When I came back [from
the trip], Stanford and the Arts
Institute funded the creation of
a new arts publication, The Stan
ford Arts Review I was one of
the cofounders and the original
arts editor," Salazar said.
The University has also in
vested heavily in interdiscipli
nary efforts that aim to connect
different fields of study with
each other and the arts.
"The idea behind the arts
initiative was to create interdis
ciplinary connections between
[different] parts of the Universi
ty," Hinton said. "Out of the arts
initiative, there grew new pro
fessorships, new graduate
stipends for interdisciplinary
students, new programs, immer
sion trips and this year, we
launched the interdisciplinary
honors in the arts program."
Salazar argued that such programs indi
cate that Stanford is in the middle of an artis
tic revival.
"That was when I really began to see
that Stanford was in the middle of an arts
renaissance, and I was able to see where arts
at Stanford would be in the years to come,"
she said. "A lot of programs that I run right
now were started around that time."
The honors program in the arts is one of
the more high-profile new offerings for stu
dents interested in the arts. It gives students
not specifically studying the arts or the hu
manities the opportunity to do interdiscipli
nary work between their own field and the
arts.
"The interdisciplinary honors program
in the arts allows students irrespective of
their major to incorporate the arts into their
capstone project," Hinton explained.
Hinton noted the overlap with other
University initiatives, like the introduction of
a joint major program that will combine com
puter sciences with humanities disciplines.
"A lot of what we do is about students
who are interested in both say you are a
computer scientist who wants to make a vi
sual arts project using your computer sci
ence skills — there are opportunities for
you to do that," Hinton explained. "It doesn't
have to feel like it is a choice to choose one
or the other."
Hinton also emphasized the Spark
grants, which are grants specifically for non
academic work.
"[lt is] a grant specifically for two stu
dents from different areas who want to come
together and create a project that will be dis
played somewhere on campus," Hinton said.
Tiews explained that new academic pro
grams will not be the only new arts initiatives
at Stanford over the coming years.
"The Anderson Collection, which is go-

and spaces on Stanford's campus, such as
the Cantor Arts Center, Cummings Art Build
ing and the Arts and Architecture Library.
ing to hold a large variety of paintings, is go
ing to open near the Cantor Arts Center," he
said.
Hinton described the Andersen Collec
tion as arguably the best collection of post-
WWII American art, and said that it will be
an international draw.
Tiews also singled out the opening of
the new arts building in the coming fall.
"In the fall of 2015, we will be opening
the McMurtry Building, which will be the
new home of the departments of art and art
history," he said. "This means that students
making art will be in the same building as
those studying it, and they will all be nearby
two art galleries on campus."
Hinton said that the goal of these efforts
to boost the arts is part of a long-term goal to
make the arts a part of a more holistic and in
terdisciplinary Stanford student experience.
"Stanford is not just a great place to
study X, Y or Z, but it's a great place to study
all of these things, and not necessarily indi
vidually," he said. "We are indeed reforming
undergraduate education and the general
feel of that seems to be allowing students to
do lots of different things."

tity during her time at Stanford.

"I knew that there were art
programs, but I think that in the
time since my freshman year,
arts programs have definitely ex
ploded on campus," Salazar said.

She recalled that one of her
greatest undergraduate experi
ences was her participation in
Stanford's Arts Immersion Pro
gram in New York during spring
break of her sophomore year, a
program that is now run by her
office.

"When I came back [from
the trip], Stanford and the Arts
Institute funded the creation of
a new arts publication, The Stan
ford Arts Review I was one of
the cofounders and the original
arts editor," Salazar said.
The University has also in
vested heavily in interdiscipli
nary efforts that aim to connect
different fields of study with
each other and the arts.
"The idea behind the arts
initiative was to create interdis
ciplinary connections between
[different] parts of the Universi
ty," Hinton said. "Out of the arts
initiative, there grew new pro
fessorships, new graduate
stipends for interdisciplinary
students, new programs, immer
sion trips and this year, we
launched the interdisciplinary
honors in the arts program."
Salazar argued that such programs indi
cate that Stanford is in the middle of an artis
tic revival.
"That was when I really began to see
that Stanford was in the middle of an arts
renaissance, and I was able to see where arts
at Stanford would be in the years to come,"
she said. "A lot of programs that I run right
now were started around that time."
The honors program in the arts is one of
the more high-profile new offerings for stu
dents interested in the arts. It gives students
not specifically studying the arts or the hu
manities the opportunity to do interdiscipli
nary work between their own field and the
arts.
"The interdisciplinary honors program
in the arts allows students irrespective of
their major to incorporate the arts into their
capstone project," Hinton explained.
Hinton noted the overlap with other
University initiatives, like the introduction of
a joint major program that will combine com
puter sciences with humanities disciplines.
"A lot of what we do is about students
who are interested in both say you are a
computer scientist who wants to make a vi
sual arts project using your computer sci
ence skills — there are opportunities for
you to do that," Hinton explained. "It doesn't
have to feel like it is a choice to choose one
or the other."
Hinton also emphasized the Spark
grants, which are grants specifically for non
academic work.
"[lt is] a grant specifically for two stu
dents from different areas who want to come
together and create a project that will be dis
played somewhere on campus," Hinton said.
Tiews explained that new academic pro
grams will not be the only new arts initiatives
at Stanford over the coming years.
"The Anderson Collection, which is go-

and spaces on Stanford's campus, such as
the Cantor Arts Center, Cummings Art Build
ing and the Arts and Architecture Library.
ing to hold a large variety of paintings, is go
ing to open near the Cantor Arts Center," he
said.
Hinton described the Andersen Collec
tion as arguably the best collection of post-
WWII American art, and said that it will be
an international draw.
Tiews also singled out the opening of
the new arts building in the coming fall.
"In the fall of 2015, we will be opening
the McMurtry Building, which will be the
new home of the departments of art and art
history," he said. "This means that students
making art will be in the same building as
those studying it, and they will all be nearby
two art galleries on campus."
Hinton said that the goal of these efforts
to boost the arts is part of a long-term goal to
make the arts a part of a more holistic and in
terdisciplinary Stanford student experience.
"Stanford is not just a great place to
study X, Y or Z, but it's a great place to study
all of these things, and not necessarily indi
vidually," he said. "We are indeed reforming
undergraduate education and the general
feel of that seems to be allowing students to
do lots of different things."

Stanford's ascendancy to
the pantheon of higher educa
tion is most commonly linked to
the University's prowess in tech
nical disciplines. Less heralded,
however, are Stanford's pro
grams in the arts and humani
ties, even as the University con
tinues to make great leaps for
ward in those fields.
Matthew Tiews, executive
director of arts programs, ex
plained that Stanford had
mounted a concerted push to
balance out the University's of
ferings and the recognition af
forded them.
"All of this is part of, as you
say, a real, dedicated push by the
University," Tiews said. "It start
ed with the Stanford Arts Initia
tive back in 2006, one of the big
platforms that the University
wanted to address."
The Stanford Arts Institute
serves as an organizational and
umbrella group of sorts for many
arts and humanities initiatives at
Stanford. Stephen Hinton, a pro
fessor of music theory and the
faculty director of the Stanford
Arts Institute, noted that the in
stitute has launched a number of
programs throughout its short
life to date.
"The arts initiative was one
of several initiatives that the
University launched at the time,
as a part of the Stanford Chal
lenge," Hinton explained. "The
idea was that no one department
or school could really take own
ership of the initiatives, because
the initiative required people
coming together from different

disciplines."
Students acknowledged the
impact of this effort to increase
focus on the arts.
