## Stanford boosts arts focus 
### NITISH KULKARNI DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's ascendancy to
the pantheon of higher educa
tion is most commonly linked to
the University's prowess in tech
nical disciplines. Less heralded,
however, are Stanford's pro
grams in the arts and humani
ties, even as the University con
tinues to make great leaps for
ward in those fields.
Matthew Tiews, executive
director of arts programs, ex
plained that Stanford had
mounted a concerted push to
balance out the University's of
ferings and the recognition af
forded them.
"All of this is part of, as you
say, a real, dedicated push by the
University," Tiews said. "It start
ed with the Stanford Arts Initia
tive back in 2006, one of the big
platforms that the University
wanted to address."
The Stanford Arts Institute
serves as an organizational and
umbrella group of sorts for many
arts and humanities initiatives at
Stanford. Stephen Hinton, a pro
fessor of music theory and the
faculty director of the Stanford
Arts Institute, noted that the in
stitute has launched a number of
programs throughout its short
life to date.
"The arts initiative was one
of several initiatives that the
University launched at the time,
as a part of the Stanford Chal
lenge," Hinton explained. "The
idea was that no one department
or school could really take own
ership of the initiatives, because
the initiative required people
coming together from different

disciplines."
Students acknowledged the
impact of this effort to increase
focus on the arts.

Paula Salazar 'l3, the Uni
versity's arts in student life coor
dinator for the University, ex
plained that arts programs have
increased in intensity and quan
tity during her time at Stanford.

"I knew that there were art
programs, but I think that in the
time since my freshman year,
arts programs have definitely ex
ploded on campus," Salazar said.

She recalled that one of her
greatest undergraduate experi
ences was her participation in
Stanford's Arts Immersion Pro
gram in New York during spring
break of her sophomore year, a
program that is now run by her
office.

"When I came back [from
the trip], Stanford and the Arts
Institute funded the creation of
a new arts publication, The Stan
ford Arts Review I was one of
the cofounders and the original
arts editor," Salazar said.
The University has also in
vested heavily in interdiscipli
nary efforts that aim to connect
different fields of study with
each other and the arts.
"The idea behind the arts
initiative was to create interdis
ciplinary connections between
[different] parts of the Universi
ty," Hinton said. "Out of the arts
initiative, there grew new pro
fessorships, new graduate
stipends for interdisciplinary
students, new programs, immer
sion trips and this year, we
launched the interdisciplinary
