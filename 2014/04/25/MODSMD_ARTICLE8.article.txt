## Why I'm here 
### Matt Lopez 
I've been here, among the arches
and palm trees of Stanford Uni
versity, for nearly four years
now, and my earlier memories have
begun to blur. But in the presence
of 1,000 bright, terrified, not-yet
jaded prospective freshmen, I have
to ask, and I have to remember:
Why am I here?
To be honest, I'm here because
of my dad.
Though I probably should, I
don't want to think about why I'm
here in an existential sense. There
are decisions to be made about pur
pose and meaning and direction,
but those are not interesting today.
Instead, I want to remember the
road that brought me here, first as
a child, then at seventeen and final
ly at eighteen.
Like I said, it starts with my
dad. George Lopez 'Bl played on
the Stanford baseball team as a re
lief pitcher and majored in econom
ics. After graduation, he worked at
a number of banks, and eventually
he found the one that contained
my mom, Leslie. They married in
1989 and had me in 1992. So
maybe I'm here because my dad is
an alumnus.
My dad's grandparents immi
grated to Texas from Mexico, a sto
ry that I imagine is common among
we millions named Lopez. George
was born in Texas and moved to a
city near Los Angeles when he was
three. My grandma is fluent in
Spanish, my dad is not, and I am not
either. Leslie's lineage flows directly
back to Austria, thick with Judaism.
So maybe I'm here because my dad
is Hispanic, and I half-am too.
When I was younger and we
would drive up the Interstate 5 on

the way to vacation, we would of
ten stop at Stanford for a few
hours. Deep within a box in my
garage back home, there exists a
picture of me, no older than 10, sit
ting on a planter in the Quad with
my eyes locked on the pages of a
book. It's a sunny day, of course,
and Hoover Tower shines in the
background. So maybe I'm here be
cause early in my life my dad
showed me how to fall in love with
Stanford, and I never forgot.
All of this helps explain why I
was accepted to Stanford, but still I
ask: Why am I here?
Four years ago we drove up the
Interstate 5 and stopped at Stan
ford for my Admit Weekend. Right
away, I met three fellow ProFros
one of them had a perfect SAT
score! and I began to doubt my
self. After a few hours, I got tired of
having the same conversation over
and over ("My name is Matt; I'm
from near LA; I'm not sure, maybe
political science; Yes, I'm definitely
coming here"). One morning I
walked out of MemAud in the mid
dle of being told how great I was
and how much I deserved to be
here. I met my parents in the
wooded area next to the Oval and I
broke down. I'm here because my
dad, patiently, let me cry until I was
ready to stop.
The summer after high school,
I got a job at a luxury hotel called
the Westlake Village Inn. My office
might have been better described
as a closet, where I sat with a desk,
computer, telephone, overhead
drawer space and the occasional
curious hotel guest. I sat alone
