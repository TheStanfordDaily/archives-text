## Moral dilemma faces Clippers faithful 
### Michael Peterson 
Growing up, I went to
Los Angeles Clippers
games nearly every
year with my family,
rocking my Cuttino
Mobley jersey, joining in "Let's go
Clippers, let's go!" chants with Clip
per Darrell and cheering on the likes
of Sam Cassell, Elton Brand, Chris
Kaman and Corey Maggette. I would
consider myself a Clippers fan.
While I always knew that Clippers
owner Donald Sterling was a terrible
owner from a management perspec
tive, I never really knew how he was
as a person. Then on Friday night,
TMZ released a recording of a person
alleged to be Donald Sterling making
extremely racist comments to his girl
friend â€” comments that have no
place in this world and bring his posi
tion as the owner of a basketball fran
chise under serious questioning.
After heaiing of Sterling's com
ments, Clippers head coach Doc
Rivers responded, "I don't know if
I'm surprised or not." That, my
friends, tells the whole story
In 2006, Sterling paid $2.75 million
to settle a lawsuit that claimed he and
his wife made statements "indicating
that African-Americans and Hispan
ics were not desirable tenants and
that they preferred Korean tenants,"
according to ESPN.

Then in 2009, after being fired as
general manager of the Clippers, El
gin Baylor sued Sterling for wrongful
termination, stating that Sterling had
a "vision of a Southern plantation
type structure" for the Clippers, ac
cording to the Los Angeles Times.
Baylor also accused Sterling of hav
ing a "pervasive and ongoing racist
attitude."
Clearly, the comments Sterling
made are just a part of a history of
racist actions. And yet, this man still
runs an organization in a league that
continually seeks to promote caring,
equality and fairness. As offensive as
Sterling's comments were to me and
NBA fans everywhere, I can't even
imagine how Clippers star players
Chris Paul and Blake Griffin and
Rivers feel after their boss directly
targeted their race, in addition to oth
er players, coaches, management and
officials throughout the league.
Is there something that I'm miss
ing here? Because I'm just not get
ting how Sterling has been allowed to
be an owner for this long and why
these issues did not come under
greater question from the start I
didn't even know about them until
now. Maybe I just wasn't following
closely enough, but it seems like past
incidents were simply ignored. If the
NBA had previously dealt with Ster
ling's actions, then it likely wouldn't
be in this situation.

However, the NBA didn't act upon
these issues before, and I'm not sure
what they are capable of doing this
time. The league's owners essentially
serve as bosses of the commissioner
and it would be a giant move for new
commissioner Adam Silver to sus
pend or remove Sterling now after
former commissioner David Stern
did not do so in the past.
But something must be done.
These actions have gone on for far too
long and, at least to my knowledge,
with far less action, attention and dis
cussion than needed. It's sad to see
Clippers players who have worked so
hard toward the goal of winning an
NBA championship be undermined
and distracted by their owner in the
most crucial time of the season. It's
far sadder to realize that racist ac
tions and thoughts still exist through
out the world and in a big, supposed
ly sophisticated business that has
thrilled and excited us for many
years.
Sports have long been deeply in
volved with integration in society and
have appeared to be so successful in
this area as of late that sometimes we
forget such thinking still exists.
Now I find myself in a difficult sit
uation. By watching and rooting for a
team that I love, I continue to support
the business of a man whose thoughts
and ideals sicken me. How do you

It's time for a

cheer for a team without sup
porting the man who ultimate
ly runs it? That will be the
question for many Clippers
fans as long as Sterling re
mains in charge.
It's time for a precedent
setting move by the NBA.
During one of the greatest
first rounds in recent memo
ry, the thrilling action has
been overshadowed by Ster
ling's racist comments. It's

shocking and honestly sad
dening that Sterling's racism
was even tolerated in the first
place, but it would be de
testable to let this racism per
sist. Sterling must go.
Light has finally been shed
on Sterling's behavior and the
basketball community de
mands a response. Your move,
NBA.
