# STREAK SNAPPED IN FINALS
## 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
The second-seeded Stanford
men's volleyball team was swept for
the first time this season on Satur
day, losing the MPSF title match to
top seed BYU, 25-23, 25-22, 25-22,
at the BYU Smith Fieldhouse in
Provo, Utah. The loss ended the
Cardinal's impressive 13-match
winning streak, which was their
longest since 1997.

Despite not receiving an auto
matic berth to the NCAA Tourna
ment due to the loss, Stanford re
ceived an at-large berth to the tour
nament in Chicago this week, in
which six teams will play for the
NCAA title.
Stanford had already lost twice
to BYU this season in the school's
two meetings. BYU was the No. 1
seed and has led the MPSF all sea
son with dominant performances.
While Stanford outhit BYU .284 to
.266, Saturday's match was no dif
ferent than the first two of the sea
son for both teams, as Stanford
played well but BYU came out with
the win. This loss marks the fifth
time this season that the Cardinal
lost a match while outhitting their
opponent.
The Cougars had a formative
advantage at their home court in
Smith Fieldhouse, which had a sea
son-best turnout of 4,367 fans on
Saturday. BYU came out swinging
and seemed to have the momentum
from the beginning of the match.
The Cardinal were playing catch-up
the whole match and were never
able to gain the advantage over the
Cougars. Stanford had more errors
than normal, with some critical at
tack errors (17) and service errors
(17) that provided BYU the chance
to capitalize off Stanford's mistakes
and pull ahead late in each set.
BYU led in the first set 16-11 be
fore letting Stanford get within two
points at 19-17. But it was a service
error by Stanford — which is nor
mally very consistent from the
service line — that gave BYU the
first set at 25-23. The second set
was better for the Cardinal, which
led the set as late as 19-17. BYU,
however, used the crowd to rally
and gain momentum to overcome
Stanford and take the second set
25-22. The third and final set was
nearly identical to the second, with
Stanford coming out aggressively
and gaining the lead only to have
BYU come from behind to take the
lead at 20-18. While Stanford man
aged to fight off two match points,
the third match point was the

charm and BYU won 25-22.
Senior outside hitter Brian Cook
once again was at the center of
Stanford's offense with a dominant
performance, hitting .483 and
recording 17 kills. The two-time Ail-
American averages 3.81 kills per set
and has hit a .353 for the season.
Cook also had two blocks and five
digs on the night.
Senior opposite Eric Mochalski
also had an impressive perform
ance, with nine kills and nine digs
for the match. Conrad Kaminski
continued his .500 average hitting
percentage, the highest in the
MPSF, with six kills for the night.
Surprisingly, normally consistent

senior Steven Irvin had 10 attack
errors in the match, seeming un
able to find his rhythm in the high
pressure environment, though he
was able to record nine kills and six
digs.
It was the performance by two
time MPSF Player of the Year Tay
lor Sander that led BYU's offense
and spurred the critical points used
to rally from behind on multiple oc
casions for the Cougars. He had 15
kills on the night with a .324 hitting
percentage. Sander was named to
the MPSF All-Tournament team
along with Stanford's Cook and
sophomore James Shaw, who tallied
36 assists in the loss.

The Cardinal will next move for
ward to face Erskine (21-6) in a
NCAA Tournament play-in match
on Tuesday, with the winner set to
appear in the NCAA Tournament.
Erskine is in the second year of its
program, quickly making a name
for itself in men's volleyball. If
Stanford wins, it will be the first
time since 2010 that it has reached
the tournament. In that 2010 ap
pearance, Stanford brought home
the program's second national title.
Stanford will take on Erskine on
Tuesday in Chicago at 4 p.m.
