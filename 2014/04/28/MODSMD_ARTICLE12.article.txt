# Ducks soar over Card
## Softball swept by No. 1 Oregon 
### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 1 team in the nation
lived up to its billing this week
end on the Farm, as the Oregon
Ducks (44-5, 17-1 Pac-12)
thrashed the Stanford softball
team (27-21, 3-15 Pac-12) in
three straight games to notch a
series sweep at Smith Family
Stadium. The Cardinal strug
gled to keep up with Oregon as
the Ducks took flight both at
the plate and in the circle. Quite
simply, Oregon dominated the
Card in all aspects of the game.

Stanford's offense, which is
on pace to break several team
records this season, did not ma
terialize against a formidable 1-
2 combination in Duck pitchers
Cheridan Hawkins and Karissa
Hovinga. The Card only scored
three runs and notched 13 total
hits in the three game set, as
Hawkins and Hovinga com
pletely stifled any offensive
production.
In turn, Oregon had a field
day at the plate, hitting .322 and
scoring 21 runs against the Car
dinal rotation. While Madi
Schreyer had a better weekend
against the Ducks, particularly
in four innings of relief on Sun
day afternoon, the freshman

from Woodinville, Washington,
was unable to handle an experi
enced Duck squad without any
run support.
In Friday night's opener on
ESPNU, the Ducks jumped on
Schreyer in the top of the third
inning, scoring four runs on five
hits, including two RBI triples
by Oregon center fielder Koral
Kosta. In turn, the Card turned
in an anemic offensive perform
ance, stranding five runners in
a 7-0 shutout loss to the U of 0.
Saturday's afternoon con
test played out in a similar fash
ion to Friday night's defeat; the
Ducks relied on three extra
base hits to break open the
game against the Cardinal, as a
Janelle Lindvall double, a Janie
Takeda triple and a Kailee
Cuico blast to left-center field
all drove home two runs for
Oregon. Those three hits were
all the offense that the Ducks
would need, as Hovinga gave up
only one earned run and three
hits in a 7-1 win.
Finally, the Ducks finished
off the sweep on Sunday with a
strong third inning, scoring five
runs on five hits en route to a 7-
2 victory over the Card. Stan
ford was unable to drive home
enough runs when it had its op
portunities in the sixth and sev
enth innings, as the Cardinal
stranded two runners apiece in
both innings to close out the
game.
One bright spot for the Car
dinal was the play of sopho
more Kayla Bonstrom, as the
Tucson, Arizona, native hit .500
with three doubles and 2 RBIs.
