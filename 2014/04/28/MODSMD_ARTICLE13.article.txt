## Do the right thing, Mr. Silver 
### FROM THE OPINIONS DESK Winston Shi 
Los Angeles is a city eternally
at odds with itself. It's re
gional, it's stratified and it's
divided in every conceivable way. In
the capital of Southern California,
little unites us; down to our profes
sional sports teams, of which there
are either two or none in each ma
jor sport, we have no common ban
ner to fly. Living in the western
suburbs, places like Long Beach
might as well be on Mars, and I cer
tainly go there about as often. The
only thing Angelinos can agree on
is that Donald Sterling is an ass
hole.
I grew up reading advertise
ments in the Los Angeles Times
about Sterling's philanthropy, his
property developments and even
from time to time his ill-fated toy,
the Los Angeles Clippers basket
ball team. The Clippers were not
very good, and Sterling was known
as a cheapskate owner, but that did
n't differentiate him from many of
the men that dominated the NBA.
As far as I was concerned, Sterling
was the most boring prominent
businessman in America.
As I grew older, I learned some
of the things that every person in
Los Angeles eventually learns.
Sterling is not a pleasant guy.
In 2006, Sterling was sued by
the Department of Justice for hous
ing discrimination in his apartment
buildings favoring Koreans at the
expense of blacks and Hispanics. Al
though Sterling settled the case, a
California district court pointedly
referred to Sterling's legal team as
"often unacceptable, and sometimes
outrageous." Choice alleged Ster
ling quotes include "[Mexican-
Americans] just sit around and
smoke and drink all day," "[Black
people] smell" and "[Koreans] will
take whatever conditions I give
them and still pay the rent."
In 2009, former Clippers gener
al manager Elgin Baylor sued Ster
ling, claiming that Sterling told
Baylor he wanted a team with
"poor black boys from the South
and a white head coach." In the
same lawsuit, Baylor claimed that
Sterling would take female guests
into the Clippers locker room and
tell them to admire the "beautiful
black bodies."
And of course, the latest Donald
Sterling news is a recording re
leased by TMZ, in which a man
claimed to be Sterling tells his girl
friend, "It bothers me a lot that you
want to broadcast that you're asso
ciating with black people."
For the sake of brevity, I will
pass over the other embarrassing
Sterling stories. I pass over Ster
ling heckling Clippers players from
his courtside seats. I will overlook
the fact that Sterling's Clippers de
liberately undercounted their own
statistics to lower the market value
of their own players. I am even
forced to ignore the time when
Sterling welched on a promise to
assist the homeless of Skid Row.
And while there's been plenty of
justified outrage during the record
ing controversy the Clippers
protested at their playoff game on
Sunday, and every NBA figure
from Michael Jordan to Jalen Rose

has criticized Sterling for his al
leged remarks I'm going to
make a point here that I don't think
many people have touched upon.
NBA commissioner Adam Silver
condemned the recording but also
talked about due process, and cer
tainly in a court of law it would be
hard to convict Sterling for any
thing. Was it Donald Sterling
telling his girlfriend to stop associ
ating with black people? We don't
know. But given Sterling's history,
it's certainly something you would
expect.
The reaction to the recording is
clear: In NBA circles, the name
Donald Sterling is so odious that
when it comes to racism, Sterling
no longer deserves the benefit of
the doubt. Why did people immedi
ately condemn him, even though
the recording hasn't been verified?
Because we already knew that
Donald Sterling is prejudiced.
Whether or not this recording is re
al is irrelevant. It has given people
an excuse to condemn a man that
nobody in the past had sufficiently
condemned.
Regardless of Sterling's history,
the Clippers gave Sterling a re
spectability that few other institu
tions on earth could match. They
didn't wipe away his sins they
simply redefined him. When we fo
cused our ire on Sterling, it was for
not spending money or for hiring
the wrong people. If a man had on
ly Sterling's personal and business
history, he would be a pariah. But
even though we nodded at Ster
ling's racial indiscretions from time
to time, his social status was entire
ly defined by his ownership of the
Clippers.
Perhaps inherent to the issue
was a problem of scale: When Ster
ling settled the largest housing dis
crimination lawsuit in history a
bit under $8 million, counting
lawyer's fees the money still on
ly amounted to a sixth of the Corey
Maggette contract. Wikipedia isn't
the best source in the world, but it
does reflect to a certain extent the
biases of the people who write for
it, and despite Sterling's fortune,
his business activities are utterly
dwarfed by his controversies and,
most importantly, his tenure at the
Clippers. The Paul Aliens and the
Jim Dolans the industry titans
who are more famous for the busi
nesses they served than for the
teams they own are few and far
between. We don't think about Pe
ter Holt's Caterpillar dealership;
we think of the San Antonio Spurs.
Ditto for Jerry Reinsdorf and the
Chicago Bulls. And by the time he
died, nobody in L.A. knew what
else Jerry Buss did for a living any
more.
But the same issues that relate
to race apply to racists as well.
