# Poly Glamorous
## 
### Lily Zheng 
In high school, I probably
wouldn't have predicted that
polyamory would have any part
in my time as a Stanford student.
I figured that maybe I'd find
someone I'd like, we'd date and
then we'd presumably either break
up or marry only two options,
and both of them daunting. Could I
even date people if I had to choose
between falling out with them or
marriage? Marriage?
And then I actually came to
campus and added the word
"hookup" to my vocabulary, and for
a few short months I thought
everything made sense. It was so
convenient to have that sort of no
strings-attached intimacy, so nice
to not have to date so I didn't have
to think about the future. For that
one night I'd have a hell of a time,
and then we'd perhaps smile at
each other for a week as we biked
past in opposite directions. Then
we'd forget about each other,
rinse, repeat. Welcome to Stan
ford, right? We've all grown to ac
cept that.
But when I started falling in
love with multiple people instead
of just hooking up, I had to ask

myself if I was ready for
polyamory. Well, the first question
I asked was: Was poly even okay?
When it happened, it wasn't as
if it was nonconsensual we were
all from campus, we all talked
about it, agreed on it, had the con
sent of everyone involved. We
went on cute dinner dates, bick
ered over completely pointless
things, flirted over Skype, cuddled
how was that different from
"normal"? My friends had similar
relationships and were some of
the happiest, most content people
I knew. But for some reason, poly
didn't make sense to people
around me.

Some people told me that my
love wasn't genuine since it was
"spread out," or something
how could I be so cruel to my
partners as to only love them half
as much as I should, or a third as
much as I should? I was honestly
puzzled by the question; what
about people with two kids? Is
each only loved half as much as
they should be? Sorry, economists,
but love is an infinite resource
it's not like love takes up
space, and we tend to have
large hearts in the first place.
Why restrict yourself to one?

Polyamory is hardly per
fect we deal with the
same things that all relation
ships go through. Jealousy,
miscommunication, loneli
ness; we work through the
same issues as people in
monoamorous relationships,
except that for polyamorous
relationships, communicat

ing about these things is not
a choice but a necessity.
Communication is the only
difference between a
healthy poly relationship
and cheating on your
monoamorous partner. And
so we tell each other when
we're feeling jealous, when
we develop feelings for new
people, about how we feel to
wards each other multiple
times a week.

Everyone has their own
style; everyone talks
through their relationships
differently. I have friends
who have been polyamorous
for more than 10 years with
the same group of people,
friends who stay with their
primary partners and freely
rotate through their second
aries, friends who, every few
months, have two or three
different people they're in

relationships with.
And they're all really, re
ally happy.
Polyamorous people tend
to be kinky, but that's only
because being open and
communicative enough for
poly means you're open
enough for other things too.
And I think that's the most
important part of it. I don't
know if people are "predis
posed" or anything towards
polyamory, monoamory,
whatever but we've all
experienced the same bag
gage that comes out of inti
macy. How do we navigate
love and relationships in the
context of a society that en
courages us not to talk? How
and where do we have those
necessary conversations
when we're told not to have
them in the first place?
I'm not advocating for

polyamory far from it.
Rather, I think that the com
munication that makes
polyamory possible also
makes any relationship
stronger friendship,
monoamory, marriage. Be
cause how many times have
you held yourself back from
telling people things be
cause you "didn't want to
make things awkward," or
"didn't want to ruin what
you have?" The silent movie
script in today's society re
garding love and intimacy
from flirting to frolicking,
the romanticization of
"sending signals" and "read
ing actions" they all make
love into something that
doesn't make sense. And
we're told that the confusion
and frustration we feel
about love is "natural" or
even "magical."

Maybe polyamory isn't
for you. But when we look at
love through a more commu
nicative lens, we start to fall
for actual people not a set
of social gestures. We don't
fall in love with that well-ex
ecuted dinner date or kiss on
the cheek at the theater or
sudden hugs. Rather, we
learn, like and love each oth
er for the little things, the
stupid things, the fact that
they randomly think of me
at three in the morning
sometimes and aren't afraid
to tell me that. I suppose
this turned into pseudo-dat
ing advice, in the end... but
why not? We could all benefit
from a little more communi
cation.

Communication is the only
difference between a
healthy poly relationship
and cheating on your
monoamorous partner. And
so we tell each other when
we're feeling jealous, when
we develop feelings for new
people, about how we feel to
wards each other multiple
times a week.

Everyone has their own
style; everyone talks
through their relationships
differently. I have friends
who have been polyamorous
for more than 10 years with
the same group of people,
friends who stay with their
primary partners and freely
rotate through their second
aries, friends who, every few
months, have two or three
different people they're in

relationships with.
And they're all really, re
ally happy.
Polyamorous people tend
to be kinky, but that's only
because being open and
communicative enough for
poly means you're open
enough for other things too.
And I think that's the most
important part of it. I don't
know if people are "predis
posed" or anything towards
polyamory, monoamory,
whatever but we've all
experienced the same bag
gage that comes out of inti
macy. How do we navigate
love and relationships in the
context of a society that en
courages us not to talk? How
and where do we have those
necessary conversations
when we're told not to have
them in the first place?
I'm not advocating for

polyamory far from it.
Rather, I think that the com
munication that makes
polyamory possible also
makes any relationship
stronger friendship,
monoamory, marriage. Be
cause how many times have
you held yourself back from
telling people things be
cause you "didn't want to
make things awkward," or
"didn't want to ruin what
you have?" The silent movie
script in today's society re
garding love and intimacy
from flirting to frolicking,
the romanticization of
"sending signals" and "read
ing actions" they all make
love into something that
doesn't make sense. And
we're told that the confusion
and frustration we feel
about love is "natural" or
even "magical."

Maybe polyamory isn't
for you. But when we look at
love through a more commu
nicative lens, we start to fall
for actual people not a set
of social gestures. We don't
fall in love with that well-ex
ecuted dinner date or kiss on
the cheek at the theater or
sudden hugs. Rather, we
learn, like and love each oth
er for the little things, the
stupid things, the fact that
they randomly think of me
at three in the morning
sometimes and aren't afraid
to tell me that. I suppose
this turned into pseudo-dat
ing advice, in the end... but
why not? We could all benefit
from a little more communi
cation.

In high school, I probably
wouldn't have predicted that
polyamory would have any part
in my time as a Stanford student.
I figured that maybe I'd find
someone I'd like, we'd date and
then we'd presumably either break
up or marry only two options,
and both of them daunting. Could I
even date people if I had to choose
between falling out with them or
marriage? Marriage?
And then I actually came to
campus and added the word
"hookup" to my vocabulary, and for
a few short months I thought
everything made sense. It was so
convenient to have that sort of no
strings-attached intimacy, so nice
to not have to date so I didn't have
to think about the future. For that
one night I'd have a hell of a time,
and then we'd perhaps smile at
each other for a week as we biked
past in opposite directions. Then
we'd forget about each other,
rinse, repeat. Welcome to Stan
ford, right? We've all grown to ac
cept that.
But when I started falling in
love with multiple people instead
of just hooking up, I had to ask

myself if I was ready for
polyamory. Well, the first question
I asked was: Was poly even okay?
When it happened, it wasn't as
if it was nonconsensual we were
all from campus, we all talked
about it, agreed on it, had the con
sent of everyone involved. We
went on cute dinner dates, bick
ered over completely pointless
things, flirted over Skype, cuddled
how was that different from
"normal"? My friends had similar
relationships and were some of
the happiest, most content people
I knew. But for some reason, poly
didn't make sense to people
around me.

Some people told me that my
love wasn't genuine since it was
"spread out," or something
how could I be so cruel to my
partners as to only love them half
as much as I should, or a third as
much as I should? I was honestly
puzzled by the question; what
about people with two kids? Is
each only loved half as much as
they should be? Sorry, economists,
but love is an infinite resource
it's not like love takes up
space, and we tend to have
large hearts in the first place.
Why restrict yourself to one?

Polyamory is hardly per
fect we deal with the
same things that all relation
ships go through. Jealousy,
miscommunication, loneli
ness; we work through the
same issues as people in
monoamorous relationships,
except that for polyamorous
relationships, communicat

ing about these things is not
a choice but a necessity.
Communication is the only
