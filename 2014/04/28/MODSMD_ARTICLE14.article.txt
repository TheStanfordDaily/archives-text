# Poly Glamorous

### Lily Zheng 
In high school, I probably
wouldn't have predicted that
polyamory would have any part
in my time as a Stanford student.
I figured that maybe I'd find
someone I'd like, we'd date and
then we'd presumably either break
up or marry only two options,
and both of them daunting. Could I
even date people if I had to choose
between falling out with them or
marriage? Marriage?
And then I actually came to
campus and added the word
"hookup" to my vocabulary, and for
a few short months I thought
everything made sense. It was so
convenient to have that sort of no
strings-attached intimacy, so nice
to not have to date so I didn't have
to think about the future. For that
one night I'd have a hell of a time,
and then we'd perhaps smile at
each other for a week as we biked
past in opposite directions. Then
we'd forget about each other,
rinse, repeat. Welcome to Stan
ford, right? We've all grown to ac
cept that.
But when I started falling in
love with multiple people instead
of just hooking up, I had to ask

myself if I was ready for
polyamory. Well, the first question
I asked was: Was poly even okay?
When it happened, it wasn't as
if it was nonconsensual we were
all from campus, we all talked
about it, agreed on it, had the con
sent of everyone involved. We
went on cute dinner dates, bick
ered over completely pointless
things, flirted over Skype, cuddled
how was that different from
"normal"? My friends had similar
relationships and were some of
the happiest, most content people
I knew. But for some reason, poly
didn't make sense to people
around me.

Some people told me that my
love wasn't genuine since it was
"spread out," or something
how could I be so cruel to my
partners as to only love them half
as much as I should, or a third as
much as I should? I was honestly
puzzled by the question; what
about people with two kids? Is
each only loved half as much as
they should be? Sorry, economists,
but love is an infinite resource
