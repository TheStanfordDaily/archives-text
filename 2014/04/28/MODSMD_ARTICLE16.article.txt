# Being green and looking it, too
## 
### Joe Troderman 
We care about the planet at
Stanford. From being a
leader in renewable re
search to funding student environ
mental projects via sources like The
Green Raid; from SESI, the new
project that will replace our old co
generation by saving the waste heat
of energy production, to solar pan
els all over campus and from the
various gardens on campus and lo
cal food purchases to the tens of stu
dent groups on campus with envi
ronmental focuses (which the school
graciously funds), there is no deny
ing that Stanford is a university
that cares about sustainability.
But it's more than just an admin
istrative concern: Students reaf
firmed that they value our planet
(with an overwhelming majority of
over 78 percent on the ASSU bal
lot), calling for Stanford to divest its
endowment from fossil fuel compa
nies, whose products contribute sig
nificantly to global climate change.
However, there are also times
when simply carelessness or
thoughtlessness cloud student
minds, causing us to be wasteful.
Moreover, this attitude permeates
to a deeper level than simply the
student body, reaching through the
core of our university in one very
clear way: As much hard work as
the administration and mainte
nance staff do at Stanford Universi
ty, we students fall short in a very
clear area the physical appear
ance of our university.

What comes to mind most
strongly now is how our university
has dealt with the ongoing drought
across California. None would ar
gue that the situation has been se
vere: in fact, it's been economically
devastating to many industries and
has had a serious impact on the way
people live their lives. When one
knows that they might lose their
water at any moment to rationing, it
is quite scary.
The fact is, though, with all the
money Stanford University has,
this threat is non-existent. We can
buy our way out of any environmen
tal problem. But it is exactly this
problem-solving mindset that is our
university's greatest environmental
problem. Stanford is rich enough to
be apathetic. So while the rest of the
state begins to look like a desert,
Stanford quite literally remains a
green oasis. While the university
has made serious efforts to cut wa
ter usage, promoting an education
campaign for students to use less
water and making various upgrades
in water efficiency, our university
has failed in a very serious way dur
ing this drought, and that way has
been in how we separate what we do
from what we say.
While we have shut the foun
tains off around campus, the grass

(the maintenance of which is highly
water intensive) stays green and in
the mornings, we can often still see
puddles and mud. While there are
electric and biodiesel Marguerite
shuttles, there are also giant trucks
that rip out all the grass in front of
Stern, plant a piece of modern art,
and then continue to place down
new turf to keep everything looking
green. This behavior is dichotic and
should be recognized as such. And
this dichotomy damages the entire
ethos of our campus, making us, to a
degree, environmental hypocrites.
When one sees sprinklers fresh
ly spritzing in the afternoon to
nourish a newly planted lawn, it
does not send the message that
there is a drought. And when our
campus remains an oasis while we
put up notices in bathrooms about
how to conserve water, the message
students imbibe is mixed.

Our campus' collective care
about the earth is clear at times, but
sometimes, this concern wanes. Es
pecially at times when students are
stressed, the slight extra effort in
volved to "be green" on campus can
be too much. This negligence is un
derstandable and reasonable: we
cannot all be perfect always, of
course. But Stanford tries to look
perfect, and without reminders
around us about the degraded state
of our planet, it can become easier
to fall into this rut and be negligent
ourselves.

President Hennessy has stated
before that sustainability should be
a part of everything we do on our
campus. But in order for that mes
sage to be sincere, we need to have
an image that matches it. Of course,
aesthetics are important (well, some
of us engineers don't particularly
care about that), and we should
maintain a beautiful campus; yet
when we maintain beauty with
lawns and temperate plants on a
land that is naturally chaparral, the
message is not one of stustainabili
ty. The message is instead that we
are a gilded cage, protected from all
(much to the chagrin of any natural
ist philosopher). It is true that our
university has money, but that does
not mean we should be exuberant.

In away, Stanford's drought re
sponse reminds me of the global po
litical landscape on climate change.
Poor, developing countries cannot
afford to be concerned with the envi
ronment when they lack basic infra
structure. But more developed, af
fluent countries already have the ba
sic necessities and can afford to act
differently: They can work toward
using less and revamping their in
frastructure toward more sustain
able modes. The same holds true for
affluent universities and individuals.
But on the whole, all three groups

have failed to live up to their capabil
ities to be leaders and to take re
sponsibility for their own actions.
The only places that can truly afford
to make changes are the ones choos
ing not to.
While it is complicated for a re
search university with many vested
interests, Stanford has verbally
made the message to be sustainable.
Yet, like the countries which signed
the Kyoto Protocol more than 15
years ago, we have maintained a
business as usual attitude, caring
more about our appearances to at
tract people to our campus, striving
to catch up to Harvard's endowment
when our returns are already likely
in excess of a billion dollars per an
num, and competing in an imaginary
cold war with every other university.
Stanford's administration actual
ly has a bit of its own duck syn
drome, working like mad men to
keep every plant painted chrome
and every blade of grass green,
while all our research (and our
school website) tells us it is unnatu
ral to have grass at all in chaparral
environments, that affluent con
sumerism creates unsustainable
footprints and that climate change is
eminent and dangerous. But the
sprinklers stay on and the alumni
events still use bottled water.
Of course, our university cannot
change overnight. But over decades,
we've remained the same. And as
our natural environment drops hints
with once-in-one-hundred-year
droughts, we need to listen now.
Imagine the message our univer
sity would send if the grass turned
brown. The divestment vote was
nonbinding, but what if we went car
bon neutral and divested from fossil
fuels entirely, too? I think that then,
the message we would be sending
would align with our research and
with President Hennessy's state
ment. And if that were to happen,
the collective consciousness of our
university would shift, too. Students
could not take a 20-minute shower
without remembering that there is a
drought. Nor could they drive to
Lag Late Night because it was too
far to bike or walk from Manzanita
without thinking that their actions
would be contributing, if only a little,
to the climate change that makes
our droughts more severe.
We all play a role in our campus
culture, though, and so while our
university can drive our thoughts,
we too must be active. That is where
student leadership comes in, where
our voices and votes matter, and
where we can be the ones to move
Stanford where it needs to go, so
that it can be the leader that only
Stanford can afford to be.
