# STUDENT LIFE
## Documentary group sparks student activism Cameras as Witness aims to foster discussion through films 
### ALEXIS GARDUNO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the past four years, Stanford's
Camera as Witness (CAW) program
has sought to foster student activism
on campus by working hand-in-hand
with student leaders to spark conver
sation on contentious social issues.
CAW is the Stanford affiliate of
The United Nations Association Film
Festival (UNAFF), an international
documentary film festival founded in
1998 that takes place each year in the
Bay Area. UNAFF documentaries
frequently feature themes like human
rights, environmental themes, popula
tion migration, refugees and home
lessness.
Jasmina Bojic, the founder of UN
AFF and CAW, stated that she creat
ed the organizations because she
wanted to apply documentaries to ed
ucation.
"I was inspired by how documen
taries can be used in away of educa
tion," Bojic said, before adding, "One
of the reasons I decided to found UN
AFF here in the Bay Area is because
it is the birthplace of the United Na
tions, not New York."
UNAFF has worked to support the
work of the United Nations by "con
tinuing the conversation" about hu
man rights issues in the United
States and around the world. The fes
tival does not, however, receive politi
cal or financial support from the Unit
ed Nations.
