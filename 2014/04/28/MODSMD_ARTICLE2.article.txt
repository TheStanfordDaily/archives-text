## Documentary group sparks student activism Cameras as Witness aims to foster discussion through films 
### ALEXIS GARDUNO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the past four years, Stanford's
Camera as Witness (CAW) program
has sought to foster student activism
on campus by working hand-in-hand
with student leaders to spark conver
sation on contentious social issues.
CAW is the Stanford affiliate of
The United Nations Association Film
Festival (UNAFF), an international
documentary film festival founded in
1998 that takes place each year in the
Bay Area. UNAFF documentaries
frequently feature themes like human
rights, environmental themes, popula
tion migration, refugees and home
lessness.
Jasmina Bojic, the founder of UN
AFF and CAW, stated that she creat
ed the organizations because she
wanted to apply documentaries to ed
ucation.
"I was inspired by how documen
taries can be used in away of educa
tion," Bojic said, before adding, "One
of the reasons I decided to found UN
AFF here in the Bay Area is because
it is the birthplace of the United Na
tions, not New York."
UNAFF has worked to support the
work of the United Nations by "con
tinuing the conversation" about hu
man rights issues in the United
States and around the world. The fes
tival does not, however, receive politi
cal or financial support from the Unit
ed Nations.
Meanwhile, CAW works direct
ly with students to find out which
international issues students want
to learn about and attempt to
match their interests with a rele
vant documentary.
"They [student leaders] ask
whether we want to know a little
more about living in Pakistan or in
a gay-lesbian community in a dif
ferent part of the world; so then
we go to the CAW/UNAFF

archive, get some of the films, and
then talk with the filmmakers to
try and get them here as well,"
Bojic said.
According to Bojic, student in
volvement has proven critical to
UNAFF's success. For example,
last February, South Korean stu
dent Youngdon Youn participated
in a "Welcome to North Korea"
discussion in Crothers Hall.
CAW also manages an ongoing
collaboration with Crothers' Glob
al Citizenship theme.
"We'll have a couple screen
ings where we'll have a student
and faculty member discussion
afterwards," said Adriana Baird

'l5, a member of the Stanford
Film Society.
In a similar effort, CAW will
screen "Citizen Koch" tonight and
host a discussion between the doc
umentary's Academy Award-nomi
nated filmmakers, Carl Deal and
Tia Lessin, and audience mem
bers.
'"Citizen Koch' is about democ
racy in the United States, but it's
much more about the legal system,
and voting, and how much we are
involved in the voting process," Bo
jic said.
