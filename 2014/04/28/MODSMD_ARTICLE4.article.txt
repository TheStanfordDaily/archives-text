### CHELSEY SVEINSSON 
On Thursday evening at CEMEX Auditori
um, Glenn Singleton M.A. '93, an award-win
ning author and former admissions director of
the University of Pennsylvania, discussed race
at Stanford during "Courageous Conversa
tions," an event hosted by the Stanford Nation
al Association for Advancement of Colored Peo
ple (NAACP).

The event received close to 250 audience
members, with those in attendance expressing
mixed reactions to Singleton's talk in general

and to its presentation and focus in particular.
Singleton framed his objective as bettering
the Stanford community through his work on
critical race theory.
"What I am focused on right now and what I
am feeling right now is a deep commitment to
Stanford," Singleton said.
Singleton went on to discuss examples of
what he considered courageous conversations
about race, including Supreme Court Justice
Sonia Sotomayor's dissent against the case up
holding Michigan's ban on affirmative action.
He noted that he himself had waited until his

graduation day at the Graduate School of Edu
cation to bring up his issues with race.
Following his anecdotes, Singleton present
ed several charts of data showing that African-
American, Latino and Native American high
school students consistently score lower than
their white counterparts on the SAT, even when
controlling for household income.
Singleton subsequently introduced four
agreements staying engaging, speaking the
truth, experiencing discomfort and expecting
and accepting non-closure that he de
scribed as potentially helping to stir con
versations about race in the college set
ting.
The last half of the talk featured audi
ence participation, with attendees speak
ing about race issues they had personally
faced or encountered in their community
and how they would like to see them ad
dressed. Some audience members pub
licly shared their personal experiences
and ideas on how Stanford can better fa
cilitate conversations about race.
Overall, Singleton lauded the manner
in which audience members engaged with
one another.
"I am so proud of the group," he said.
"I am excited by the examples from when
the folks stood up."
Kyle Neil 'l7, one of the event organiz
ers and a member of the Stanford
NAACIf described Singleton's guidance
as applicable to conversations not just
about race but about other sensitive top
ics on campus.
"I thought that these tools that Glenn
gave us would be very useful in furthering
the conversation about race but more im
portantly would give us the tools to have
difficult conversations," Neil said. "When
you look at the idea of 'Courageous Con
versations,' it is not specifically attached
to race."
However, not everyone left the event
feeling that they had gained newfound
courage or skillset to broach conversa
tions about race.
Jonathan Spratley 'l5 argued that the
discussion was not focused enough.
"I had high hopes for Glenn Single
ton's 'Courageous Conversations,' howev
er I left fairly disappointed," Spratley
said. "From the beginning, Singleton's ex
cessive arrogance left me wondering what
the event was about."
Jackie Fielder 'l6, an organizer for the
event and a member of the NAACIJ
claimed that attendees will continue to
have conversations about race long after
the conclusion of the event, despite the
generally mixed reaction.
"I hope it will give at least the people
who attended the impetus to start talking
about race and not just race with self but
race within their student groups, them
dorms and their daily lives," she said.
During an interview with The Daily
following his presentation, Singleton
framed the purpose of the Thursday talk
as moving the Stanford community to
wards implementing tools to have conver
sations about race on campus.
"Today I really wanted the campus to
move toward action," Singleton said.
