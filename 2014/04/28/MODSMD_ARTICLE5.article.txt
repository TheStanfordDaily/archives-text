# TITLE DROUGHTS QUENCHED
## THIRD YEAR'S THE CHARM FOR CARD 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
As the saying goes, "Defense wins
championships."
After falling just short of MPSF titles
with losses in the 2012 and 2013 champi
onship matches, No. 1 Stanford women's
water polo (22-1, 6-0 MPSF) continued to
flex its muscles on defense and was finally
able to add a conference title to its long list
of accolades over the last several seasons
with a 6-5 victory over No. 2 UCLA in the
MPSF title match on Saturday.
The Cardinal's third victory over the
Bruins (25-4, 5-1) this season gave them
their first conference title since 2006 and
the fifth in program history. As the top
overall seed in the tournament, the Cardi
nal earned a first-round bye before defeat

ing No. 4 California in the semifinal to set
up the marquee battle between the top two
teams in the nation. Stanford has now won
both No. 1 versus No. 2 duels in which it
has participated this year both against
UCLA in the last three weeks.
The ultimate difference in the matchup
came down to Stanford's ability to take ad
vantage of favorable situations after falling
behind early, using three 6-on-5 goals and a
converted penalty, coupled with suffocating
defense, to overcome a halftime deficit and
pull off the comeback.

With neither team having exceeded 10
points in any of the squads' last three
matchups this year, another defensive bat
tle was par for the course. And while the 6-
5 final score certainly seemed to imply a

defensive struggle through
out the matchup, that was
definitely not the case dur
ing the first period, in which
six of the match's 11 goals
were scored.
Sophomore Maggie Stef
fens opened the scoring
quickly before UCLA
scored just 28 seconds later
on a power play. Although
UCLA proceeded to push
ahead 2-1 and later 3-2,
Stanford didn't allow itself
to fall behind too signifi
cantly early, with equalizers
from senior Kaley Dodson
and freshman Jamie
Neushul to keep the score
knotted at the end of the
first period.
However, UCLA's de
fense which forced Stan
ford to tie a season-low in
scoring by allowing just six
points buckled down in
the second period, holding
Stanford scoreless and tak
ing a 5-3 halftime lead on a
power-play goal from soph
omore Kodi Hill and a late
goal from junior Emily
Donohoe.
Prom there, however, it
was all Stanford for the rest
of the match.

Using a defensive ad
justment with double teams
on both Donohoe and sopho
more Rachel Fattal, it was
Stanford's defense that
commanded the second half
as it held UCLA's offense
scoreless, giving the power
ful and opportunistic of
fense a fighting chance at
mounting the eventual
comeback.
With five 30-goal scorers
on the offense leading the
charge for the Cardinal, it
was only a matter of time
until Stanford would be able
to put more points on the

board as the match went on.
It started with senior Anni
ka Dries, who brought the
Cardinal within one with
4:53 left in the third period.
With just more than two
minutes left, Stanford drew
a five-minute penalty, giving
Steffens the opportunity to
step up and punch through
the match-tying goal.
And in the final period,
Stanford was finally able to
complete the comeback, us
ing a power play goal from
senior Kelsey Suggs to take
the lead for good after sti
fling two power plays from
UCLA. Clinging to a one
point lead with 3:55 left to
play, Stanford was able to
hang on despite one final
Bruin power play in the
waning seconds of the
match. The monumental de
fensive effort to ice the
game included a four-save
performance from sopho
more Gabby Stone, who
continues to impress down
the stretch against some of
the most powerful offenses
in the country.
With the victory, Stan
ford claimed an automatic
berth into the eight-team
NCAA Championships from
May 9-11 hosted by USC,
with the two at-large berths
not awarded to conference
champions likely going to
UCLA and another MPSF
team. The Cardinal join
Princeton (CWPA),
Pomona-Pitzer (SCIAC),
Wagner (MAAC), UC-San
Diego (WWPA) and UC-
Irvine (Big West) as confer
ence champions.
The Cardinal will look to
return to the NCAA title
game for the fifth year in a
row and claim its third na
tional championship in the
last four seasons when the
NCAA Championships kick
off in Los Angeles on May 9.

up the marquee battle between the top two
teams in the nation. Stanford has now won
both No. 1 versus No. 2 duels in which it
has participated this year both against
UCLA in the last three weeks.
The ultimate difference in the matchup
came down to Stanford's ability to take ad
vantage of favorable situations after falling
behind early, using three 6-on-5 goals and a
converted penalty, coupled with suffocating
defense, to overcome a halftime deficit and
pull off the comeback.

With neither team having exceeded 10
points in any of the squads' last three
matchups this year, another defensive bat

defensive struggle through
out the matchup, that was
definitely not the case dur
ing the first period, in which
six of the match's 11 goals
were scored.
Sophomore Maggie Stef
fens opened the scoring
quickly before UCLA
scored just 28 seconds later
on a power play. Although
UCLA proceeded to push
ahead 2-1 and later 3-2,
Stanford didn't allow itself
to fall behind too signifi
cantly early, with equalizers
from senior Kaley Dodson
and freshman Jamie
Neushul to keep the score
knotted at the end of the
first period.
However, UCLA's de
fense which forced Stan
ford to tie a season-low in
scoring by allowing just six
points buckled down in
the second period, holding
Stanford scoreless and tak
ing a 5-3 halftime lead on a
power-play goal from soph
omore Kodi Hill and a late
goal from junior Emily
Donohoe.
Prom there, however, it
was all Stanford for the rest
of the match.

Using a defensive ad
justment with double teams
on both Donohoe and sopho
more Rachel Fattal, it was
Stanford's defense that
commanded the second half
as it held UCLA's offense
scoreless, giving the power
ful and opportunistic of
fense a fighting chance at
mounting the eventual
comeback.
With five 30-goal scorers
on the offense leading the
charge for the Cardinal, it
was only a matter of time
until Stanford would be able
to put more points on the

board as the match went on.
It started with senior Anni
ka Dries, who brought the
Cardinal within one with
4:53 left in the third period.
With just more than two
minutes left, Stanford drew
a five-minute penalty, giving
Steffens the opportunity to
step up and punch through
the match-tying goal.
And in the final period,
Stanford was finally able to
complete the comeback, us
ing a power play goal from
senior Kelsey Suggs to take
the lead for good after sti
fling two power plays from
UCLA. Clinging to a one
point lead with 3:55 left to
play, Stanford was able to
hang on despite one final
Bruin power play in the
waning seconds of the
match. The monumental de
fensive effort to ice the
game included a four-save
performance from sopho
more Gabby Stone, who
continues to impress down
the stretch against some of
the most powerful offenses
in the country.
With the victory, Stan
ford claimed an automatic
berth into the eight-team
NCAA Championships from
May 9-11 hosted by USC,
with the two at-large berths
not awarded to conference
champions likely going to
UCLA and another MPSF
team. The Cardinal join
Princeton (CWPA),
Pomona-Pitzer (SCIAC),
Wagner (MAAC), UC-San
Diego (WWPA) and UC-
Irvine (Big West) as confer
ence champions.
The Cardinal will look to
return to the NCAA title
game for the fifth year in a
row and claim its third na
tional championship in the
last four seasons when the
NCAA Championships kick
off in Los Angeles on May 9.

As the saying goes, "Defense wins
championships."
After falling just short of MPSF titles
with losses in the 2012 and 2013 champi
onship matches, No. 1 Stanford women's
water polo (22-1, 6-0 MPSF) continued to
flex its muscles on defense and was finally
able to add a conference title to its long list
of accolades over the last several seasons
with a 6-5 victory over No. 2 UCLA in the
MPSF title match on Saturday.
The Cardinal's third victory over the
Bruins (25-4, 5-1) this season gave them
their first conference title since 2006 and
the fifth in program history. As the top
overall seed in the tournament, the Cardi
nal earned a first-round bye before defeat

ing No. 4 California in the semifinal to set
up the marquee battle between the top two
teams in the nation. Stanford has now won
