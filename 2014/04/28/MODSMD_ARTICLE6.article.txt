# FIRST TITLES FOR GOLF SINCE 1990s

### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
The drought is finally over. The streak
has, at long last, ended. The elusive has now
become the reality. Today, the Pac-12 Men's
and Women's Golf Championship trophies
reside where they haven't been for some 20
years: Stanford University.
After successfully weathering a wild final
round push by Washington, the Cardinal
men's golf team captured its first conference
title since 1994, defeating the second-place
Washington Huskies by 15 strokes. Junior
Patrick Rodgers made it a sweep for Stan
ford, as he picked up the first and only indi
vidual Pac-12 crown of his storied collegiate
career. The outgoing junior entered Sun
day's fourth round with a five-shot lead, see
ing the advantage shrink a tad over the final
18 holes but ultimately holding on to best
UW's Cheng-Tsung Pan, who finished two
strokes back of the two-time First Team Ail-
American.
Despite the Huskies' impressive final

round performance, the Card's lead was nev
er seriously in doubt. Head coach Conrad
Ray's sextet led from the gun and took all of
the drama out of the event by Saturday's
end. By then, Stanford had built a 21-shot
cushion over Cal, an advantage due in large
part to Rodgers' magnificent Friday after
noon second round. The former Pac-12
Freshman of the Year scorched The Gallery
at Dove Mountain course, firing a tourna
ment-low 7-under 65, an effort aided by three
eagles over a seven-hole stretch on his back
nine.

But with the Pac-12 employing a play
six-count five format, the Cardinal needed
much more than the drives, chips and putts
of just one player. Unlike last season's con
ference event at which Stanford was able to
put just two golfers in the individual top 20,
the squad placed five in the top 20 this year.
After Rodgers came senior Cameron Wilson
in third, recording his highest career finish
in four starts at the Pac-12 championships.
