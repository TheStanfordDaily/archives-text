# FIRST TITLES FOR GOLF SINCE 1990s
## 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
The drought is finally over. The streak
has, at long last, ended. The elusive has now
become the reality. Today, the Pac-12 Men's
and Women's Golf Championship trophies
reside where they haven't been for some 20
years: Stanford University.
After successfully weathering a wild final
round push by Washington, the Cardinal
men's golf team captured its first conference
title since 1994, defeating the second-place
Washington Huskies by 15 strokes. Junior
Patrick Rodgers made it a sweep for Stan
ford, as he picked up the first and only indi
vidual Pac-12 crown of his storied collegiate
career. The outgoing junior entered Sun
day's fourth round with a five-shot lead, see
ing the advantage shrink a tad over the final
18 holes but ultimately holding on to best
UW's Cheng-Tsung Pan, who finished two
strokes back of the two-time First Team Ail-
American.
Despite the Huskies' impressive final

round performance, the Card's lead was nev
er seriously in doubt. Head coach Conrad
Ray's sextet led from the gun and took all of
the drama out of the event by Saturday's
end. By then, Stanford had built a 21-shot
cushion over Cal, an advantage due in large
part to Rodgers' magnificent Friday after
noon second round. The former Pac-12
Freshman of the Year scorched The Gallery
at Dove Mountain course, firing a tourna
ment-low 7-under 65, an effort aided by three
eagles over a seven-hole stretch on his back
nine.

But with the Pac-12 employing a play
six-count five format, the Cardinal needed
much more than the drives, chips and putts
of just one player. Unlike last season's con
ference event at which Stanford was able to
put just two golfers in the individual top 20,
the squad placed five in the top 20 this year.
After Rodgers came senior Cameron Wilson
in third, recording his highest career finish
in four starts at the Pac-12 championships.

Junior Patrick Rodgers (above) is one individual title away from tying Tiger Woods' record
of 10 after winning the only Pac-12 individual title of his career on Sunday in Arizona.
Entering Sunday's round at
even-par with rounds of 72-
71-73 under his belt, Wilson
turned up the heat in the fi
nal 18, holing five birdies en
route to a 4-under 68 score
that moved him from T-4th
into the top three.
Freshman Maverick Mc-
Nealy's T-9th position gave
the Card three in the individ
ual top-10 no other team
in the field had more than
two. The Bay Area native,
who has been inconsistent at
times throughout his fresh
man year, showed up in a big
way on Sunday with a four
birdie, two-bogey 2-under 70
to vault from T-17th into the
top-10. Classmate Viraat
Badhwar and sophomore
David Boote rounded out
Stanford's top-20 perform
ers, both finishing T-16th in
the 72-man tournament.
Still, the day, and indeed
the weekend, belonged to
Rodgers, as he recorded his
10th collegiate win, four of
which have come during this
spring season. He now is just
one victory shy of tying the
program record, held by
Tiger Woods.
Initially, it seemed, one
drought would end and an
other would be prolonged.
As late as the final hole at
the Pac-12 Women's Golf
Championships, it appeared
the Stanford women would
finish a close second to Ari
zona and barely miss out on
the team's first conference
win since 1999. Apparently,
the women thought the par
ty that ensued in Tucson,
Arizona, after their male
counterparts' victory just
wasn't enough, and threw
one of their own in Corvallis,
Oregon, a short time later to
celebrate a comeback victory

for the ages.
At the outset, it looked as
if this could be the iteration
that ended the winless
streak. Friday's opening
round marred by a 90-
minute delay due to heavy
rain and hail saw junior
Mariko Tumangan bust out
of her spring slump with a 5-
under 67 on the fabled Tryst
ing Tree course. A punch like
that was exactly what the
Cardinal needed: a solid
fourth score to support the
relatively consistent efforts
of sophomores Mariah
Stackhouse and Lauren Kim
and freshman Casey Daniel
son. And it showed in the re
sults: Head coach Anne
Walker's squad overcame
the inclement weather to sit
in second, just one shot back
of national title contender
UCLA. On top of that, the
juggernaut that is USC had
an uncharacteristically off
day and found itself further
back in the pack.
Thus, everything ap
peared to be coalescing for
the Card at exactly the right
time: Tumangan was turning
her play around a neces
sary development if Stan
ford was to have any chance

of winning and the Tro
jans were faltering. Though
much golf was left to be
played, everything seemed
to portend a positive ending
for the quintet.
Saturday was a different
story, however. The windy
and rainy conditions contin
ued as the Cardinal shot five
strokes worse than the day
before, posting a 3-over 291
cumulative score to drop to
third. Tumangan's resur
gence was short lived, as she
followed-up her 67 with a 9-
over 81 in the second round.
Stackhouse too wasn't able
to replicate her Friday per
formance, coming in at 3-
over 75 on moving day. Even
Kim's ace on the par-3, 154-
yard 13th hole wasn't
enough to lift the team's
score, which left it four back
of UCLA and three behind
Arizona, with USC looming
in fourth.
By mid-round Sunday,
Stanford was still in the mix
at the top but there was an
overwhelming feeling of a
moral victory coming on:
that the Card would battle
tough but it simply wouldn't
be enough to overcome the
stacked Bruins and Trojans

squads. No shame in losing
to two of the best NCAA golf
teams of all time. Plus, the
Cardinal would return 80
percent of their lineup to
next year's event this just
wasn't their time, yet.
This unit decided that
"yet" couldn't wait until next
year or the season after that
the moment to strike was
now, and strike they did. In a
wild sequence of events, Ari
zona's Lindsey Weaver and
Southern Cal's Annie Park
shot a combined 3-over on
holes 15-18, while their
group-mate Stackhouse
stayed bogey-free during
that stretch. That, coupled
with UCLA's 10-over 288
team score, opened a door
that Stanford barely eked
through, breaking through
the chains of history and
hardship to cross the thresh
old of victory.
Both men's and women's
teams will find out their
NCAA Regional assign
ments this week, with the
women beginning play on
May 8 followed by the men a
week later.

Sophomore Lauren Kim (above) hit a hole-in-one on the par-3 13th hole this past weekend,
which ultimately played a role in Stanford's narrow 1-stroke margin of victory.
