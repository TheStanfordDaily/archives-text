# Q&A DAVID SPIEGEL PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE
## 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Professor of Medicine David
Spiegel was recently named as the
2014 recipient of the Joan and
Stanford Alexander Award in
recognition of his research on
stress and health. The Daily sat
down with Spiegel, who will accept
the award and give a lecture on his
work on April 30 at the Baylor Col
lege of Medicine, to discuss his in
terest in hypnosis, changes he has
witnessed in his field over time
and the award itself.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What
have been some of the most influen
tial changes you have seen in your
field [psychiatry and behavioral sci
ences] throughout your professional
career?
David Spiegel (DS): I think the
field has moved from being bot
tom-up, as far as the body-mind
relationship goes, to being more
open to the idea of some top-down
control... The field has also start
ed to recognize that the way you
use your mind can have an effect
on your body. We can control pain
and anxiety, and we can help peo
ple better, even with serious ill
nesses.
I think we have taken a less
mechanistic view of what the
mind-body relationship is like and
are beginning to open up to the
idea that how you live your life,
how you manage your anxiety,
stress and symptoms can have an
effect on not just how you live with
the disease but how long you live
with the disease.
TSD: What drew your interest to
hypnosis as a form of pain man
agement and healing?
DS: My father was a psychia
trist who learned how to use hyp
nosis in World War 11, and he was
practicing it when I was a kid. I
used to hear him talk about his
cases, and I was fascinated by
what he did. I then took a hypnosis
course in medical school, and I
think the turning point was this
patient I had. They told me,
"Spiegel, your next case is an asth
ma patient, she's in room some
thing or other down the hall." I
just followed the sound of the
wheezing down the hall, and there
was this fifteen-year-old in bed,
knuckles white and struggling for
breath.
She was in bad shape, and her
mother was crying. I asked her if
she wanted to learn a breathing
exercise, and she nodded. I had
just started the hypnosis course
and managed to get her hypno
tized. Within five minutes, she's ly
ing back in bed; she's breathing
better; and her mother stopped
crying. She had been hospitalized
every month for three months and
had one subsequent hospitaliza
tion and now is studying to be a
respiratory therapist.
I thought that anything that
can help a patient that much was
worth looking into. I started ex
ploring hypnosis to see how it
could help people in stressful situ
ations dealing with mind-body
problems. I started doing random
ized control trials to see if [hypno
sis] worked and looked at the neu
rophysiology to see what was go
ing on in the brain when you use
hypnosis. In 1998, I opened the
Center for Integrative Medicine at
Stanford, and hypnosis is one of
the main treatments that we offer.
TSD: Did you find that your re
search was met with a lot of
skepticism? If so, how have you
continued to stand your ground?
DS: Yes, I have. There are peo
ple who think hypnosis is just a
bunch of mumbo-jumbo, and it is
n't. It's the oldest western concep
tion of psychotherapy. My main
way of dealing with it is knowing
that to advance medical care you
need facts, not opinions. My way of
standing up to it is to do the re
search, publish it in mainstream
journals and let people read the
work and decide if we have enough
evidence to support our claims.
TSD: What can integrative med
icine do that traditional cannot?
DS: I'd say one of the big prob
lems in American healthcare is
that we're really good at acute
care ... You get diagnosed quickly
and accurately and treated defini
tively, and it's very good. [Where]

we're not so good is with chronic
medical problems because we keep
applying an acute care model.
The way integrative medicine
helps is it provides ways for people
to manage symptoms like anxiety,
pain, fatigue and depression with
techniques like mindfulness,
acupuncture and hypnosis that are
very useful in that setting. I think
where we are really good is deal
ing with chronic symptoms that we
can help people manage better.
TSD: How does it feel to be
granted the Joan and Stanford
Alexander Award?
DS: It feels very good. It's al
ways nice to have people recognize
that what you're doing seems to
have an impact, and they've given
it to some very prominent people.
It feels nice to have your peers ac
knowledge that what you do seems
to be important and have an im
pact on how people think about
psychiatric conditions. I'm grate
ful to Stanford that I've had the
opportunity to build the kind of ca
reer that allows me to get that
kind of recognition. This is a place
where the sky is the limit if you
can do it, where you have an op
portunity to develop ideas and test
them.
TSD: What would you like to see
in the future for the use of hyp
nosis and its integration?
DS: I would like to see people
use it as a regular technique to
help them focus better, think bet
ter and manage stressors better. I
use it as a therapeutic tool, but a
lot of what I teach patients virtual
ly anybody can learn. I would love
to see it used as a teaching and
learning technique that most peo
ple know how to do. I think there's
a lot we learn from helping people
manage pain and anxiety and focus
their attention. I'd like to see it not
as just some weird historical foot
note but as a standard technique.
