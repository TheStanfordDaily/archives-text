## MEN'S VOLLEYBALL FACES POSTSEASON PLAY-IN GAME 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's volley
ball team won't have much time
to rest, as it received an at-large
berth to an NCAA play-in
match this afternoon in Chicago
after a disappointing loss to
BYU in the finals of the MPSF
Tournament over the weekend.
In that play-in match, the No. 3

seed Cardinal (22-8) will face
No. 6 seed Erskine College (21-
6), with the winner of the match
advancing to the NCAA semifi
nals.
A win would take Stanford to
the NCAA Tournament for its
first appearance since the 2010
season, when Stanford won the
championship and brought
home its second national title. If
Stanford advances, it will set up

a rematch with second-seeded
BYU with a spot in the national
championship match on the line.
Despite being swept by BYU
last weekend, Stanford has had
a dominant and otherwise per
fect ending to the season. The
Cardinal were on a 13-match
winning streak and had not yet

been swept during the sea
son. The keys to Stanford's
13-game winning streak and
success were its confident
and aggressive offense that
was balanced with consisten
cy and patience. Against
BYU, Stanford had more er
rors than normal and
seemed flustered and lack
ing momentum at points
throughout the match. If the
team wants to beat Erskine,
they have to get the bad
taste of the BYU loss out of
their mouths and play as
they did before losing the
MPSF Tournament.
Senior All-American Bri
an Cook has been paramount
to Stanford's success, aver
aging 3.81 kills and 4.30
points per set. He is hitting
.353 for the season and
brings leadership and guid
ance to the team, keeping
calm under pressure and
stepping up in big moments.

The Cardinal have another
Ail-American in sophomore
setter James Shaw, who is
the driving force for the of
fense's consistency. Also vi
tal to Stanford's offense are
senior Steven Irvin with a
.295 attack percentage this
season and senior Eric
Mochalski with a .294 attack
percentage. Impressively,
sophomore Conrad Kamins
ki has not only maintained,
but has actually increased
his league-leading percent
age to .509.
As a team, the Cardinal
average 13.6 kills per set and
limit their opponents to 11.3
kills per set. The team has a
hitting percentage of .335
and has only been outhit a
few times this season, but
has lost several matches de
spite outhitting their oppo
nents. One of Stanford's
strong suits is its service
game, with 154 aces so far
this season.

Erskine is a new team to
collegiate competition and is
in just its second season of
play. The team earned an au
tomatic berth by sweeping

Mount Olive in their confer
ence tournament, the Con
ference Carolinas Champi
onship. Sophomore outside
hitter Mike Michelau, who
was the tournament's most
valuable player, leads the
Flying Fleet's offense. He
averages a .256 attack per
centage and over four kills
per set, with over 359 kills so
far this season. He is the on
ly Erskine player that aver
ages over four kills per set,
with Roberto Vargas coming
in second with 3.73 kills per
set.
As a team, Erskine aver
ages a .268 attack percent
age and 13.6 kills per set.
Like Stanford, Erskine is
very strong from behind the
service line with 155 aces so
far this season. Further
more, it has limited oppo
nents to just 81 aces, provid
ing the team with a strong
advantage from the service
line. Its major weakness has
been blocking, having been
consistently out-blocked by
opponents throughout the
season.
Because Erskine is out

side of Stanford's league and
the two have never faced
each other before, it is diffi
cult to know how the two
teams will match up. Many
view Stanford's conference,
the MPSF, as the toughest in
the country. Erskine's
league is less competitive
and the Flying Fleet there
fore has not faced many top
ranked opponents this year.
The only two common oppo
nents Erskine and Stanford
have shared this season
were Lewis University and
Cal Baptist, both of which
Stanford defeated. Erskine,
however, lost to Lewis.
The Cardinal have two
major advantages: Stanford
faced tougher opponents and
has experience and success
in the NCAA Tournament.
This will be Erskine's first
time ever in the tournament.
The match will be played
at Loyola University in
Chicago, the No. 1 overall
seed and tournament host,
this afternoon at 4 p.m.
