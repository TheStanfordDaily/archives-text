## Conference titles elude Cardinal Ahn, Zhao unable to clinch doubles victory 
### FIONA NOONAN STAFF WRITER 
The No. 9 Stanford women's tennis
team (16-2, 8-2 Pac-12) fell short this
weekend at the Pac-12 Women's Tennis
Championships in Ojai, California. Six dif
ferent Cardinal players reached at least
the quarterfinals in doubles, singles and
invitational doubles and singles, but none
ultimately won the tournament finals.
In the main draw, the Cardinal were
represented in singles by No. 49 junior
Ellen Tsay, No. 54 sophomore Krista
Hardebeck, No. 40 freshman Taylor
Davidson and No. 23 freshman Carol
Zhao, who came into the tournament
seeded fourth.
After an incredible run in last year's
tournament in which she reached the sin
gles championship match, Hardebeck
bowed out early this year after falling 6-3,
7-5 to UCLA's No. 13 Chanelle Van
Nguyen, who came into the singles tour
nament ranked second.
For the other three Cardinal players,
the first round draw was significantly eas
ier, with no opponents listed on the nation
al rankings or seeded higher in the tour
nament.
Tsay, Davidson and Zhao each downed
their opposition on Thursday morning to
advance to the round of 16 later in the day,
during which the sailing was not as
smooth.
Tsay fell to California's No. 31 Denise
Starr, who was the only Bear to lose her
match to the Cardinal when the two teams
faced on April 19. Davidson also reached
the end of her tournament run as Arizona
State's No. 55 Desirae Krawczyk upset
the exceptionally solid freshman in three
sets.
That left just Zhao in the running for
the singles championship, and after whip
ping through Julija Lukac of Washington,
Cal once again stood between the Cardi
nal and the title. On Friday, Zhao's quar
terfinal draw was No. 25 Lynn Chi, who
came into the draw as the fifth seed, mak
ing the match one of the most intense of
the tournament.
After just two sets, though, Chi had
her second victory over a Stanford player
in a week, and she went on to the semifi
nals instead of Zhao. Chi ultimately lost in
the semifinals to UCLA's top-seeded Jen
nifer Brady, who went on to win the sin
gles tournament.
Still, Zhao, a freshman from Canada,
had an impressive run at her
first Pac-12 Tournament and
quickly had to refocus her
self to begin doubles play.
Zhao and senior Kristie Ahn
were seeded top overall spot
in the doubles draw after
losing just one match during
conference play. The No. 38
duo of Davidson and Tsay al
so made an appearance as
the third overall seed.
Both Cardinal pairs
breezed past the round of 16
and into the quarterfinals,
where UCLA's No. 11 duo of
Chanelle Van Nguyen and
Courtney Dolehide took
down Davidson/Tsay 8-5.
Zhao and Ahn, however,
continued to cruise straight
through to the semifinals,
where Zhao had double the
opportunity for revenge in
facing Cal's No. 42 Lynn Chi
and Annett Schutting on
Saturday. Schutting and Chi
were also the only team to
have defeated Ahn and Zhao

during the regular season,
which clinched the doubles
point for Cal on Stanford's
Senior Day.
This time was different.
Ahn and Zhao came out fir
ing, and took down the Cal
pair 8-3 to move on to the
Ojai Tournament doubles
championship against USC's
Kaitlyn Christian and Giu
liana Olmos.
Olmos and Christian
were a bit of a surprise com
ing into the finals, especially
after not having been ranked
during the regular season.
Regardless, they overcame
the odds to defeat Stanford's
last shot at a title with a 6-3,
6-3 result on Sunday after
noon.
If Ahn and Zhao had won,
it would have been the first
conference doubles title for
the Cardinal since 2006.
Overall, the weekend was
still a success for Stanford's
squad despite the lack of an
ultimate victory. Their
biggest and most important
stage yet, the NCAA Tour
nament, is still to come.
Ahn will be back in the
singles rotation for the na

tional championships, and
Hardebeck should also be in
good form in the No. 2 posi
tion in the Cardinal's lineup.
Bright spots will also cer
tainly include Zhao and No.
52 freshman Caroline Doyle,
who had a fantastic weekend
in the invitational portion of
the tournament. She came in
seeded first in her draw, and
went all the way to the semi
finals before falling to No. 70
Olmos of USC.

The best could certainly
be still to come for Stanford,
and plenty of opportunities
for vengeance will surface as
the NCAA Tournament be
gins. Pac-12 powerhouses
UCLA, USC and Cal will all
be present in the tournament,
as will East Coast heavy-hit
ters Duke, Virginia and
Georgia.
Despite some recent loss
es, the Cardinal will go in as
strong as ever, hoping to
show the nation why they are
the most decorated women's
program in the history of col
lege tennis.
