## Conference titles elude Cardinal Ahn, Zhao unable to clinch doubles victory 
### FIONA NOONAN STAFF WRITER 
The No. 9 Stanford women's tennis
team (16-2, 8-2 Pac-12) fell short this
weekend at the Pac-12 Women's Tennis
Championships in Ojai, California. Six dif
ferent Cardinal players reached at least
the quarterfinals in doubles, singles and
invitational doubles and singles, but none
ultimately won the tournament finals.
In the main draw, the Cardinal were
represented in singles by No. 49 junior
Ellen Tsay, No. 54 sophomore Krista
Hardebeck, No. 40 freshman Taylor
Davidson and No. 23 freshman Carol
Zhao, who came into the tournament
seeded fourth.
After an incredible run in last year's
tournament in which she reached the sin
gles championship match, Hardebeck
bowed out early this year after falling 6-3,
7-5 to UCLA's No. 13 Chanelle Van
Nguyen, who came into the singles tour

For the other three Cardinal players,
the first round draw was significantly eas

Tsay, Davidson and Zhao each downed
their opposition on Thursday morning to
advance to the round of 16 later in the day,
during which the sailing was not as
smooth.
Tsay fell to California's No. 31 Denise
Starr, who was the only Bear to lose her
match to the Cardinal when the two teams
faced on April 19. Davidson also reached
the end of her tournament run as Arizona
State's No. 55 Desirae Krawczyk upset
the exceptionally solid freshman in three
sets.
That left just Zhao in the running for
the singles championship, and after whip
ping through Julija Lukac of Washington,
Cal once again stood between the Cardi
nal and the title. On Friday, Zhao's quar
terfinal draw was No. 25 Lynn Chi, who
came into the draw as the fifth seed, mak
ing the match one of the most intense of
the tournament.
After just two sets, though, Chi had
her second victory over a Stanford player
in a week, and she went on to the semifi
nals instead of Zhao. Chi ultimately lost in
the semifinals to UCLA's top-seeded Jen
nifer Brady, who went on to win the sin
gles tournament.
Still, Zhao, a freshman from Canada,
