# UNEXPECTED EARLY EXIT
## Men's tennis falls in Pac-12 tourney 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
After closing out its regular
season on a strong note with a
five-match winning streak, the
No. 27 Stanford men's tennis
team (14-5, 5-2 Pac-12) was un
able to extend its success to the
postseason as it suffered a 4-2
first-round defeat in the Pac-12
Tournament at the hands of No.
49 Oregon (17-8,1-6).
Although the Cardinal had
likely booked its ticket to the
upcoming NCAA Tournament
with its run to end the season, a
strong showing at the confer
ence tournament would have
left little to doubt about Stan
ford's postseason aspirations.
And being matched up against
either Washington or Oregon
both teams that Stanford
had defeated down the stretch
seemed to put Stanford in a
favorable position to make a
deeper run into the tourna
ment.
However, the third-seeded
Cardinal turned in an uncharac
teristic performance against
seventh-seeded Oregon in
which they claimed the doubles
point but struggled on singles,
which ultimately led to their
early exist from the bracket af
ter a first-round bye.
Despite having issues finish
ing out doubles matches during
its winning streak to close out
the season, Stanford started
out the match against Oregon

on a strong note, with the No. 2
doubles pairing of senior Jamin
Ball and junior John Morrissey
cruising to an 8-4 victory before
the No. 3 pairing of freshman
Yale Goldberg and sophomore
Trey Strobel earned an 8-6 de
cision to give Stanford just its
second doubles point in the last
five matches a good sign giv
en that head coach John
Whitlinger had identified the
doubles point as a focus for the
team moving forward.
Unfortunately for the Cardi
nal, the normally strong singles
corps wasn't able to take advan
tage of the early lead. Although
Morrissey on court one, senior
Daniel Ho on court two, sopho
more Anthony Tsodikov on
court five and junior Robert
Stineman on court six all won
their first sets, only Tsodikov
was able to carry through to a
singles win, as the sophomore
gave Stanford its second and fi
nal point of the afternoon with a
6-1, 7-6 (4) victory over Ore
gon's Joey Swaysland.
On court four, sophomore
Nolan Paige was quickly dis
patched, 6-3, 6-4 by his Duck
opponent, while Stineman and
Ho both faltered after their suc
cessful first sets with three-set
losses to give the Ducks the 3-2
lead. Needing to clinch a victory
to tie the match at three points
apiece and give Stanford a shot
at the win, Morrissey continued
his battle on court one but to no
avail; the junior from Ireland
went down relatively quietly in
the third set to No. 78 Robin
Cambier of Oregon in a 4-6,6-4,


ZETONG LI/The Stanford Daily
Sophomore Anthony Tsodikov (above) won the second and final point for
Stanford against Oregon as the Ducks outpaced the Card in a 4-2 win.
6-2 decision to ice the match
for the Ducks.
The singles performances
were a stark contrast to
those in the teams' earlier
meeting this season, which
Stanford won 4-2 after losing
the doubles point. Benefitting
from dominant singles per
formances from Morrissey,
Strobel and Tsodikov, as well
as the match-clinching three
set victory from Ho, the Car
dinal cruised to victory.
The Ducks would go on to
flop in the semifinals as they
lost 4-0 to second-seeded

UCLA, which eventually
pulled off the upset of top
seeded USC in the finals to
claim the conference tourna
ment title. Stanford was the
only team seeded in the top
four of the tournament to not
reach the semifinals.
Despite its early exit from
the tournament, Stanford is
still in a good position to
claim one of the at-large bids
to the 64-team NCAA Tour
nament field when the selec
tion show occurs this after
noon. The Cardinal will learn
their postseason fate and
presumptive next matchup
when the show airs on
NCAA.com at 2 p.m.
