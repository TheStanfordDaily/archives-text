## SUPER TUESDAY Limit government, not speech 
### Josh Jones 
Many tout campaign finance
reform as the last great
hope in the fight to fix
Washington. As such, the impact of
money in politics has long been de
bated and resisted. The Bipartisan
Campaign Reform Act of 2002,
commonly referred to as the Mc-
Cain-Feingold Act, stipulates two
major limits on campaign spending.
The first of these is a base limit,
which caps campaign contributions
to any given candidate or organiza
tion at $2,600 per election cycle.
The second major stipulation limits
the amount a single donor may con
tribute in an election cycle to
$48,600 for all federal candidates
and $74,600 to political action com
mittees (these figures are tied to
the Consumer Price Index).
On April 2, 2014, the Supreme
Court ruled 5-4 in McCutcheon v.
FEC that the second stipulation
placing aggregate caps on individ
ual campaign contributions was un
constitutional under the First
Amendment. While supporters
hailed the decision as a major win
for free speech, others warned that
the wealthy now had more power
than ever before to corrupt our
democracy.
Justice Breyer captured the
spirit of the opposition in his dis
senting opinion: "[T]he anti-cor
ruption interest that drives Con
gress to regulate campaign contri
butions is a far broader, more im
portant interest than the plurality
acknowledges. It is an interest in
maintaining the integrity of our
public governmental institutions."
Although fighting government
waste and corruption is definitely
important, there are a few prob
lems with this line of thinking.
First, it supports the notion (all too
pervasive today) that if a goal is
deemed important or utilitarian
enough, we are justified in overrid
ing Constitutional rights in its
name. One may believe that pre
venting corruption is worth placing
restrictions on campaign expendi
tures, but this value judgment
alone hardly makes doing so legal
or constitutional.
To be fair, Justice Breyer also
argued that the legal precedent set
by cases such as Buckley v. Valeo
justified the restrictions over
turned by McCutcheon. But as
the Supreme Court can and does
overrule itself to set new prece
dents, the majority opinion can
hardly be deemed out-of-form for
doing so in this instance. Regard
less of one's opinion on the ruling,
the McCutcheon decision has
clearly shown that advocates of
campaign finance reform will need
to pass a constitutional amendment
to limit campaign contributions.
The real issue at hand is
whether money is speech. But how
could we possibly classify it other
wise?
Few would argue that a pam
phlet, poster, or rally is not a form
of free speech. But as the econo
mist Murray Rothbard taught, all
freedoms of expression religion,
speech, press, and assembly are
largely, if not entirely, contingent

on property rights. After all, how
can we profess to support a man's
right to free speech while simulta
neously restricting the resources
he allocates towards traveling,
renting out venues, publishing
books, securing airtime, making
posters, creating videos and financ
ing his staff? The freedoms of ex
pression don't just protect the
grumblings of private individuals.
They demand that people have the
opportunity to propagate actively
and persuade peacefully. As Justice
Kennedy wrote in the majority
opinion in Citizens United v.
FEC, "If the First Amendment has
any force, it prohibits Congress
from fining or jailing citizens, or as
sociations of citizens, for simply en
gaging in political speech."
Yes, Washington is far from
transparent and corporatism is
alive and well in the Capitol. Money
talks â€”if not directly via bribes
and "quid pro quo" agreements,
then certainly through the aid in
terested parties can promise politi
cians during election season. How
ever, if we focus on placing arbi
trary caps on the amount of money
a person or group of people are al
lowed to expend advancing their
ideas and principles, not only do we
limit the First Amendment, we mis
diagnose the problem. Money itself
does not imperil our freedom the
offensively large and undue influ
ence the government has in our in
dividual lives and economy does.
After all, why do unions, corpo
rations and the affluent on both
sides of the aisle find it so prof
itable to spend billions of dollars on
super PACs and lobbyists?
Sadly, it is because in giving gov
ernment the power to license and
regulate to protect our citizens and
push for social equality, we have al
so given special interests strong in
centives to shape public policy. In
placing restrictions (however well
intentioned) on voluntary associa
tions and exchanges, we have given
the most powerful and affluent in
our society the ability to use the
legally sanctioned coercion of the
state to stamp out their competi
tors and prey upon the weak. We
have made it possible for interest
groups to write subsidies, loopholes
and special deals into law, often in
to the very legislation meant to re
strain their power.
The motivations of those who
wish to get the money out of politics
are admirable. But getting the pow
er out of politics is much more so,
and more effective besides. If we
want a free society, we need to re
strict the power of the state, not the
power of private citizens and or
ganizations.
