## R&DE: No substitute for Ike's 
### Andrew Aude 
Dear Shirley Everett and Michael
Gratz,

More than 1,400 students and
I are disappointed that un
der your leadership, Stan
ford Residential and Dining Enter
prises (R&DE) sought to compete
for the Forbes Family Cafe space in
Huang Engineering Center, soon to
be vacated by Ike's Place. By and
large, Stanford students prefer
Ike's to R&DE's restaurants. I
can't compare Ike's to your re
placement offering, because you
haven't even declared what kinds of
food it will serve.
Although some students griped
about Ike's price increase, more
students gripe that R&DE's prices
are even higher. R&DE's "grab and
go" bottled drinks are 20-30 per
cent more expensive than those
sold by independent vendors, with
a nearly 100 percent markup. For
example, an 8 oz. Red Bull at
Tresidder Express costs $2.29, but
the same item at Munger Market
costs $3.75. R&DE's high prices,
skimpy product offerings and mini-

mal operating hours are all reasons
why R&DE should not be opening
any more restaurants on campus.
Do you really think students want
more restaurants that are only
open from 11AM-2PM, five days
per week?
Furthermore, it is appalling that
you are able to operate your restau
rants tax-free under Stanford's
501(c)(3) status. As you know,
R&DE restaurants fail the IRS's
three-part test for Unrelated Busi
ness Income. Per IRS Publication
598, R&DE restaurants are 1) "A
trade or business," 2) "Regularly
carried on" and 3) "Not substantial
ly related to furthering the exempt
purpose of the organization" (that
organization is Stanford Universi
ty).
Despite its good intentions,
R&DE Hospitalities & Auxiliaries
doesn't seem to be acting "in sup
port of Stanford's academic mis
sion." Remember, R&DE's existing
restaurants would be paying a 30-
38 percent Unrelated Business In
come Tax if it weren't for the IRS's
broadly defined "Convenience of

Members" exemption. (However, I
would argue that R&DE's restau
rants are not convenient for stu
dents, faculty or visitors.) R&DE
restaurants unfairly outcompete
private vendors that actually have
to pay business taxes. Your vast
$lBO million annual budget will on
ly grow now that you have eliminat
ed one of your largest competitors.
Enough is enough. Stop expand
ing your restaurant business.
"Fundraising" via food sales is not
appropriate, and we deserve better.
Students want high-quality in
dependent vendors, like Ike's, on
Stanford's campus. In fact, a peti
tion to save Ike's has garnered
more than 1,000 signatures in the
last 48 hours, adding up to over
1,460 signatures total.
We ask that you forfeit your
newly awarded lease in Huang En
gineering Center.
Sincerely,
Andrew Aude 'l6
