The United States spent
$6,285,557,223 on all congres
sional and presidential elec
tions during the 2012 election cycle.
To put that in perspective, fully one
fourth of the world's countries have
a lower Gross Domestic Product
than America's campaign spending.
It was not always this way. In
2002, Congress passed the Biparti
san Campaign Reform Act, led by
Senators John McCain and Russ
Feingold. The act intended to limit
the impact of 'soft money,' which is
money spent not directly by candi
dates, but by other organizations
corporations, non-profits and
unions in support of them.
First, McCain-Feingold capped
the total amount of money that
these organizations are permitted
to contribute. Second, it prohibited
these groups from running com
mercials targeting a candidate with
in 60 days of the general election.
Third, it prohibited candidates from
coordinating with these organiza
tions.
That law survived an initial chal

Mitch McConnell in McConnell v
Federal Election Commission.
McConnell argued that the law un

constitutionally infringed on his
right to free speech equating
money to speech.
While that argument failed in
2003, the Court upheld it just seven
years later in the now infamous case
of Citizens United v Federal
Election Commission. The
group Citizens United sought to air
a film entitled Hillary: The
Movie on television. After the FEC
blocked it, Citizens United sued.
Citizens United argued that the
restrictions on advertising and do
nations unconstitutionally limited
their right to free speech. Not only
did the Supreme Court buy the ar
gument that money is speech, it al
so agreed that corporations are peo
ple, or at least are guaranteed the
same rights as people namely, in
this case, a right to speech.
In so doing, the Court permitted
the creation of super PACs, which
are political action committees that
can receive unlimited funds from in
dividuals, corporations or other
groups, as long as they do not coor
dinate their spending with candi
dates.
Setting aside the claim that
