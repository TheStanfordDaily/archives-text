The United States spent
$6,285,557,223 on all congres
sional and presidential elec
tions during the 2012 election cycle.
To put that in perspective, fully one
fourth of the world's countries have
a lower Gross Domestic Product
than America's campaign spending.
It was not always this way. In
2002, Congress passed the Biparti
san Campaign Reform Act, led by
Senators John McCain and Russ
Feingold. The act intended to limit
the impact of 'soft money,' which is
money spent not directly by candi
dates, but by other organizations
corporations, non-profits and
unions in support of them.
First, McCain-Feingold capped
the total amount of money that
these organizations are permitted
to contribute. Second, it prohibited
these groups from running com
mercials targeting a candidate with
in 60 days of the general election.
Third, it prohibited candidates from
coordinating with these organiza
tions.
That law survived an initial chal
lenge, led overeagerly by Sen.
Mitch McConnell in McConnell v
Federal Election Commission.
McConnell argued that the law un

constitutionally infringed on his
right to free speech equating
money to speech.
While that argument failed in
2003, the Court upheld it just seven
years later in the now infamous case
of Citizens United v Federal
Election Commission. The
group Citizens United sought to air
a film entitled Hillary: The
Movie on television. After the FEC
blocked it, Citizens United sued.
Citizens United argued that the
restrictions on advertising and do
nations unconstitutionally limited
their right to free speech. Not only
did the Supreme Court buy the ar
gument that money is speech, it al
so agreed that corporations are peo
ple, or at least are guaranteed the
same rights as people namely, in
this case, a right to speech.
In so doing, the Court permitted
the creation of super PACs, which
are political action committees that
can receive unlimited funds from in
dividuals, corporations or other
groups, as long as they do not coor
dinate their spending with candi
dates.
Setting aside the claim that
corporations are people, the
great irony of Citizens
United is that it claims be
cause political speech is so
important to democracy, it
should be unrestricted. But
instead, it created a system
in which political speech is
restricted to the wealthy.
Free speech is no longer
free.
In the 2012 presidential
election, super PACs spent
almost $1 billion, according
to the FEC. Research con
ducted by the Sunlight Foun
dation, a group that seeks to
promote transparency in
government, found that
31,385 people donated 28.1
percent of all political contri
butions in 2012. That's right,
1 percent of the 1 percent do

nated $1.7 billion.
More and more is being
spent each cycle, according
to the Center for Responsive
Politics.
One person, one vote is no
longer valid.
With all of this money be
ing spent, the fundamental
principle of American democ
racy is ignored. Now, one dol
lar, or some proportion there
of, translates to one vote.
The fact of the matter is
that more money does corre
late to more votes. Between
the $2.1 billion raised by
Obama and Romney, Obama
raised 51.9 percent; he took
51.1 percent of the popular
vote. The Center for Respon
sive Politics finds that the
biggest spender in a House
race wins nine times out of
10.
This should be frighten
ing if you're a democrat a
proponent of democracy. But
it should be more frightening

if you're a Democrat.
Although Obama raised
more money than Romney in
2012, Romney's unregulated
super PAC spent twice as
much as President Obama's
$153 million to $74.7 mil
lion. Of the top ten spending
super PACs, nine are associ
ated with Republicans; of the
top twenty, fifteen are. Those
five Democratic PACs spent
$81,419,130, compared to the
Republicans' $424,526,232,
according to data from the
New York Times.

However, it's not as if Re
publicans are simply more
popular with people after
all, Romney did lose. In
stead, their few donors are
spending more money. 'Max
ing out' reaching the
$2,500 cap on donations to
candidates is four times
more likely for Romney sup
porters than it is for Obama
supporters.
Unfortunately, this trend

is likely to continue. Less
than a month ago, the Court
overturned aggregate contri
bution limits. The majority in
McCutcheon v. Federal
Election Commission
confirmed that money is
speech, and that the govern
ment cannot constitutionally
limit total donations to all
candidates. That being said,
contributors can only still do
nate $2,600 to any one candi
date. But a few people will be
able to donate to even more
candidates than before.

In case after case, the
Supreme Court has under
mined the true principle of
democracy. Until Congress
decides that speech should
be free and equitably distrib
uted, we need to fight money
with money. The good news
is that this works. Nearly 60
percent of President Oba
ma's campaign contributors
donated less than $2OO. With
more than 10 million dona
tions, he outraised Mitt
Romney. Next election sea
son, be a part of that.

31,385 people donated 28.1
percent of all political contri
butions in 2012. That's right,
1 percent of the 1 percent do

nated $1.7 billion.
More and more is being
spent each cycle, according
to the Center for Responsive
Politics.
One person, one vote is no
longer valid.
With all of this money be
ing spent, the fundamental
principle of American democ
racy is ignored. Now, one dol
lar, or some proportion there
of, translates to one vote.
The fact of the matter is
that more money does corre
late to more votes. Between
the $2.1 billion raised by
Obama and Romney, Obama
raised 51.9 percent; he took
51.1 percent of the popular
vote. The Center for Respon
sive Politics finds that the
biggest spender in a House
race wins nine times out of
10.
This should be frighten
ing if you're a democrat a
proponent of democracy. But
it should be more frightening

if you're a Democrat.
Although Obama raised
more money than Romney in
2012, Romney's unregulated
super PAC spent twice as
much as President Obama's
$153 million to $74.7 mil
lion. Of the top ten spending
super PACs, nine are associ
ated with Republicans; of the
top twenty, fifteen are. Those
five Democratic PACs spent
$81,419,130, compared to the
Republicans' $424,526,232,
according to data from the
New York Times.

However, it's not as if Re
publicans are simply more
popular with people after
all, Romney did lose. In
stead, their few donors are
spending more money. 'Max
ing out' reaching the
$2,500 cap on donations to
candidates is four times
more likely for Romney sup
porters than it is for Obama
supporters.
Unfortunately, this trend

is likely to continue. Less
than a month ago, the Court
overturned aggregate contri
bution limits. The majority in
McCutcheon v. Federal
Election Commission
confirmed that money is
speech, and that the govern
ment cannot constitutionally
limit total donations to all
candidates. That being said,
contributors can only still do
nate $2,600 to any one candi
date. But a few people will be
able to donate to even more
candidates than before.

In case after case, the
Supreme Court has under
mined the true principle of
democracy. Until Congress
decides that speech should
be free and equitably distrib
uted, we need to fight money
with money. The good news
is that this works. Nearly 60
percent of President Oba
ma's campaign contributors
donated less than $2OO. With
more than 10 million dona
tions, he outraised Mitt
Romney. Next election sea
son, be a part of that.

The United States spent
$6,285,557,223 on all congres
sional and presidential elec
tions during the 2012 election cycle.
To put that in perspective, fully one
fourth of the world's countries have
a lower Gross Domestic Product
than America's campaign spending.
It was not always this way. In
2002, Congress passed the Biparti
san Campaign Reform Act, led by
Senators John McCain and Russ
Feingold. The act intended to limit
the impact of 'soft money,' which is
money spent not directly by candi
dates, but by other organizations
corporations, non-profits and
unions in support of them.
First, McCain-Feingold capped
the total amount of money that
these organizations are permitted
to contribute. Second, it prohibited
these groups from running com
mercials targeting a candidate with
in 60 days of the general election.
Third, it prohibited candidates from
coordinating with these organiza
tions.
That law survived an initial chal
lenge, led overeagerly by Sen.
Mitch McConnell in McConnell v
Federal Election Commission.
McConnell argued that the law un

constitutionally infringed on his
right to free speech equating
money to speech.
While that argument failed in
2003, the Court upheld it just seven
years later in the now infamous case
of Citizens United v Federal
Election Commission. The
group Citizens United sought to air
a film entitled Hillary: The
Movie on television. After the FEC
blocked it, Citizens United sued.
Citizens United argued that the
restrictions on advertising and do
nations unconstitutionally limited
their right to free speech. Not only
did the Supreme Court buy the ar
gument that money is speech, it al
so agreed that corporations are peo
ple, or at least are guaranteed the
same rights as people namely, in
this case, a right to speech.
In so doing, the Court permitted
the creation of super PACs, which
are political action committees that
can receive unlimited funds from in
dividuals, corporations or other
groups, as long as they do not coor
dinate their spending with candi
dates.
Setting aside the claim that
corporations are people, the
great irony of Citizens
United is that it claims be
cause political speech is so
important to democracy, it
should be unrestricted. But
instead, it created a system
in which political speech is
restricted to the wealthy.
Free speech is no longer
free.
In the 2012 presidential
election, super PACs spent
almost $1 billion, according
to the FEC. Research con
ducted by the Sunlight Foun
dation, a group that seeks to
promote transparency in
government, found that
31,385 people donated 28.1
percent of all political contri
butions in 2012. That's right,
