# Domino theory in the 21st century

### Anthony Ghosn 
Hindsight can be cruel. Watch
ing the Ukrainian crisis un
fold raises many "if only"
moments. If only President Obama
had been more assertive with Putin
over the extradition of Edward
Snowden. If only the U.S. foreign
policy apparatus had not looked so
weak in its commitment to protect
ing Syrian civilians from chemical
weapons. If only we had been more
decisive in the early days of the
Crimean annexation.
Unfortunately, it is only in retro
spect that we can know the effects of
foreign policy fumbles. However, re
visiting the chain of events that has
left Eurasia in a state of total uncer
tainty sheds light on a timeless real
ity: foreign policy is not a one-shot
game.
As Winston Churchill eerily stat
ed the year before the outbreak of
the Second World War, "Do not sup
pose that this is the end. This is only
the beginning of the reckoning. This
is only the first sip, the first fore
taste of a bitter cup which will be
proffered to us year by year unless
by a supreme recovery of moral
health and martial vigor, we arise
again and take our stand for free
dom as in the olden time." The rhet
oric of "if only's" was present during
Churchill's time as well: If only we
had not allowed Germany to violate
the Treaty of Versailles by occupy

ing the Rhineland; if only we had
never permitted the annexation of
the Sudetenland or that of Austria.
My concern however, is that the
"if only's" are going to get worse.
The President was recently in Japan
and the Philippines, two U.S. allies
that have serious territorial dis
putes with China. China and the
Philippines have been on the brink
of war several times in the last
decade and Sino-Japanese tensions
soared last year as a result of a ter
ritorial dispute over islands in the
East China Sea. The question is ob
vious: How can our allies depend on
our guarantee of protection when
we have done absolutely nothing to
hinder the annexation of Crimea?
If Russia, only the world's sixth
largest economy (and its third
largest army by military spending),
intimidated us, how can our allies
expect us to stand in the face of Chi
na? China's military spending is al
most twice that of Russia, and un
like Russia's, the Chinese economy
is central to global trade and pros
perity. Not to mention the fact that
the Chinese government has enor
mous U.S. dollar reserves and
American debt that can be used in
all sorts of ways to haunt our fragile
economy.
So what can China do? It can
continue pressing its military might,
extending its air defense zone and

furthering its saber-rattling in far
away waters. It can continue deep
ening its relationships with potential
client states in Asia and Africa that
may no longer consider American
assurances 100 percent valid.
The effects of our foreign policy
impotence in Russia will be felt in
ternationally and in unexpected
ways. The short-termism that has
plagued our economic decision mak
ing and has led our leaders to bur
den our generation with historic
amounts of debt can now be seen in
a much more dangerous context.
The world is so vastly transparent
and fast moving that we cannot af
ford to miss opportunities to demon
strate that we stand for something
greater than geopolitics or, in the
case of Crimea, domestic politics
as a nation. We stand for away of life
of freedom, democracy and free
exchange and these concepts are
worth standing up for.
The applause at the official diplo
matic platitudes that President Oba
ma is espousing in Asia seems to
have temporarily drowned out the
hollow sound of gunfire that sent the
mayor of Ukraine's second largest
city into critical care. My fear is that
the reverberations from the bullet
will outlast the applause.
