# STAND protests Kagame
## Rwandan President speaks, faces protests about human rights record 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
Around a dozen members of Stanford
STAND, a human rights group, demonstrated
outside a Graduate School of Business event
featuring Rwandan President Paul Kagame
last Friday, in an effort to prompt conversation
of and raise awareness about allegedly repres
sive actions by Kagame's administration.
According to Jared Naimark 'l4, the

STAND students demonstrated at the event
because the Stanford chapter of the national
STAND organization focuses explicitly on hu
man rights in Sudan, South Sudan, Burma,
Syria and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Rwanda has repeatedly intervened in Congo in
recent years.
The group also works with Friends of the
Congo, an organization based in Washington,
D.C. that works to raise awareness about chal
lenges faced by people in the Congo and to

support Congolese institutions.
Demonstrators emphasized, however, that
their efforts were not intended to interrupt the
procession of the event.
"We [were] not planning to disrupt the
event in any way," Naimark said. "We're curi
ous to hear what he had to say. The goal is to
get information in people's hands."
The demonstrators handed out informa-

tional factsheets and flyers
that detailed human rights
violations allegedly perpe
trated by the Kagame ad
ministration, as well as print
ed copies of an editorial arti
cle that they had published in
The Daily that day, according
to Melanie Langa 'l6, a
member of STAND and one
of the demonstrators.
"STAND was interested
in changing the dialogue
around this event because we
felt it wasn't representative
of the whole story," Langa
said. "There are whole sto
ries and perspectives that
you can take to this event.
Since he's been president,
Rwanda has made many
strides and has improved
and [Kagame's] done a good
job in a lot of cases and sce
narios but it's also important
to recognize that his govern
ment has been destabilizing
Eastern Congo and because
of that we are interested in
making sure that side of the
story people knew about."
Scott St. Marie MBA 'l5,
one of the student coordina
tors of Kagame's address,
stated that he thought the
STAND students' presence
at the event was beneficial.

"I'm glad that they were
there to help broaden our di
alogue about Kagame and
Rwanda," St. Marie said.
"Rwanda has a tumultuous
and complex history, and I'm
glad we were able to talk
about multiple perspectives."
In fact, St. Marie later ap
proached the students and en
sured that one of the STAND
representatives could engage
in the audience participation
portion of the event. Audience
questioning, according to St.
Marie, included queries about
term limits and whether
Kagame has plans to run for a

third term.
"We passed out all the fly
ers we brought and people
were very receptive," Langa
said. "I think it was very suc
cessful. We got people to
think of other issues that we
didn't think would be ad
dressed without some kind of
push and we're contributing
to what might be missing
from that conversation."
