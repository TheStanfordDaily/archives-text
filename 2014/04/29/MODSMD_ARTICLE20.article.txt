### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
The No. 2 Stanford women's light
weight varsity eight boat won the grand
final of the WVB Dl/Open event at the
WIRA (Western Intercollegiate Row
ing Association) Championships on
Lake Natoma in Rancho Cordova, Cali
fornia, on Sunday. The win is the second
two-day race event in which the Cardi
nal have taken home the gold. It was
the varsity eight boat's sixth first-place
finish this spring out of eight races. The
varsity eight has won all four of its
races in two-day regattas.
Members of the IVB title-winning
boat include freshmen Jackie Huddle
and Christine Cavallo, sophomores Brit
tany Presten and Katherine Christel,
juniors Mackenzie Crist, Alicia Kapjian-
Pitt, Jordan Duval-Smith and Bailey
Yuro and senior Molly Hayes.
The Cardinal had their second con
secutive weekend of competition after
travelling to Boston last weekend to
race against four of the other top-seven
teams in the nation. The IVB fell to then-
No. 2 Harvard-Radcliffe but finished
ahead of No. 4 Boston University, No. 5
Wisconsin and No. 7 MIT.

On Lake Natoma, the IYB and 2YB
boats had strong finishes on Saturday to
advance to the finals on Sunday. The
IVB finished in first place on the first
day of competition, five seconds ahead of
the next closest finisher, beating Port
land State, Seattle and San Diego State.
The 2VB placed third. The lVB's time of
6:51.50 was the fastest of the eight
teams in the two heats of the event that
weekend.
According to head coach A1 Acosta,
for both two-day regattas that the team
has raced in this season (the second be
ing the San Diego Crew Classic), the
team has emphasized coming out hard
and leaving nothing to regret on Satur
day to put them in a good place heading
into the second day of racing. In the
WIRA and San Diego events, the plan
panned out and the Card's IVB came
home with gold medals from both.
"After Saturday's race we identified
a few things to work on, so those were
our main focus during the race [on Sun
day]," Hayes said.
Headwinds on Sunday slowed times
slightly and the team also suffered a
technical failure, but that didn't affect
the consistency across the Card's races,
which has been a season-long goal. De-

spite being the only lightweight team to
go up against other schools' openweight
boats, Stanford won by open water with
a time of 6:53.0, finishing just over four
seconds ahead of Sacramento State and
6.5 seconds in front of Saint Mary's.
"We had some unexpected adversity
in the second half of [Sunday's] race
when the 'cox box' the microphone
system went out, but we handled it
well and didn't let it affect us," Hayes
said.

The 2VB finished in fifth on Sunday
while the varsity four boat earned silver
after finishing 5.5 seconds behind UC-
Irvine, despite trailing by a greater
margin for the majority of the race.
"As a team, I'm really proud of how
far we've come during the season,"
Hayes said. "Our lightweight four boat
did great by earning a second place [fin
ish] during their final today."
The Cardinal will regroup this week
before their annual Big Row against Cal
ifornia this Saturday at Redwood Shores.
The upcoming regatta will provide anoth
er opportunity to prepare for the IRA
Championships at the end of May.
