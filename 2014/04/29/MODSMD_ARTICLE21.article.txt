# POSTSEASON HOPES FALTER

### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
Stanford baseball's play
off chances were dealt a
tough blow this weekend, as
the Cardinal dropped two out
of three games to California
(18-21, 7-11 Pac-12) in an up
and-down series that was
frankly more down than up.
The Stanford team (18-19, I'-
ll) that won six of its last sev
en games entering the week
end only seemed to show up
on Sunday in a 4-1 win the
players posting a heart
breaking 7-4, 10-inning loss
on Saturday after a blown
save and a sloppy 9-5 loss in
Monday night's rubber
game seemed like an entire
ly different team. Those per
formances have placed a lot
of pressure on the Cardinal
with four weeks left in the
regular season.
To sum up the weekend,
entering Saturday, Stanford
was an undefeated 14-0 when
scoring more than three runs
in a game. Three games later,
the team had picked up its
first two losses in those situa
tions, highlighting the Cardi
nal's defensive and pitching
struggles in the series.
On Saturday, freshman
Cal Quantrill got the start
and battled through seven in
nings despite not having his
best stuff. After surrender
ing two runs in the third and
one in the fourth, Quantrill
allowed just one baserunner
over the next three innings.
Saturday's game was
Quantrill's longest start in his
last three appearances.
The offense tied the game
and then took the lead in the
sixth with aggressive
baserunning and a couple of
clutch hits from senior Brett
Michael Doran and senior
Brant Whiting. The Cardinal
have gone 10-for-12 in stolen
base attempts over their last
five games after going 11-for
-23 in prior appearances.
Senior reliever A.J. Vane
gas was called upon for the
two-inning save with the Car
dinal up 4-3 in the eighth, but
uncharacteristically strug
gled. He walked the leadoff
hitter and then allowed him
to score good for his first
earned run of the season, as
well as his first blown save.
In the top of the tenth, after

Stanford left the bases
loaded in the eighth and left
two men on in the ninth with
the opportunity to win the
game they left 12 runners
on base during the game
Vanegas allowed three runs
on two hits and a walk to give
the Bears a 7-4 lead.
Junior John Hochstatter,
who was making his third
start of the season after tak
ing over the spot in the rota
tion from freshman Chris
Viall, dominated Sunday's
game. He pitched his second
career complete game, al
lowing just six baserunners
and striking out three over
the nine innings. As a
starter, Hochstatter has al
lowed just four earned runs
over 23.2 innings, good for a
1.52 ERA.
"It's about the fifth time
in a row he pitched well for
us. He wasn't as sharp early
as he had been, but he got
stronger as the game went
on," said head coach Mark
Marquess. "He didn't have
much fastball command [ear
lier this season] and he got
hit a little bit early, but all of
a sudden he started getting
the fastball down, getting a
bit more velocity and that
was complemented with his
off-speed pitches. It's been a
confidence thing. He's
pitched big for us and he
knows he can do it and he's
not a freshman."
On the offensive side,
freshman Tommy Edman
stole the show, hammering a
three-run homer the first
of his career to left field in
the bottom of the fourth to
put Stanford up for good, 4-1.
"It was awesome, super

exciting. I probably had a
huge grin on my face running
the bases," Edman said. "I've
been trying to keep things
simple getting my foot
down early, seeing the ball for
really long and it's helped
my pitch selection a lot."
Through Monday's game,
Edman has exploded as of
late, amassing an eight-game
hitting streak in which he has
hit .423 (11-for-26). The five
RBIs that he has tallied over
that span more than double
his total over his first 16 ap
pearances. He has also stolen
three bases in that span.
Meanwhile, another Stan
ford player has been extend
ing a hit streak of his own, al
beit a bit more quietly follow
ing his three game-winning
hits last week. Senior Danny
Diekroeger has hit .417 (15-
for-36) over his season-long
nine-game hitting streak
though Monday, raising his
season batting average by 41
points to .304.

The momentum Stanford
gained after Sunday's win
was quickly lost on Monday,
as freshman Brett Hanewich
was hit hard early and
chased from the game after
allowing four runs two
earned over just 2.2 in
nings. It was an indication of
things to come for the Cardi
nal, as they committed three
errors in the contest, match
ing the amount of errors
they had made over the last

nine games.
"We just got beaten in
every phase of the game,"
Marquess said. "They
pitched better than us, they
played defense better than
us, hit better than us. There
wasn't a part of the game we
won."

Cal jumped to a 4-2 lead
after three innings, and later
extended it to 9-3 after pick
ing up 12 total hits in the
game. The Cardinal got the

tying run on deck in the ninth
after Bears starter sopho
more Ryan Mason faltered
towards the end of his per
formance, but Cal's closer
quickly shut them down.
Nearly every game for
Stanford is a must-win at this
point if the team hopes to
make the NCAA Tourna
ment. That journey will start
at Pacific this afternoon. The
Tigers enter the game on a
tear, having won 10 of their

last 12 games, including six of
seven on their current home
stand. They will send out
fifth-year senior southpaw
John Haberman, who is 3-1
with a 4.67 ERA in eight ap
pearances this season. The
Cardinal's starter is still to be
announced.
First pitch from Stockton,
California is set for 6 p.m.
