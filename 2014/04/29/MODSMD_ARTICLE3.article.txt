## 1,200 visit for Admit Weekend Unexpected rain dampens events and activities on Friday 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
Over 1,200 admitted students ar
rived on campus on April 24 for a rainy
Admit Weekend 2014, which offered
prospective freshmen (ProFros) pro
gramming from Thursday through
Sunday.
This year's programming included
speeches by President John Hennessy,
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2
and Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sion and Financial Aid Richard Shaw;
academic expositions and tours of ath
letic facilities, the Cantor Arts Center
and residence halls; and Friday
evening's annual BROC party.
Although Admit Weekend organiz
ers struggled to recruit a sufficient
number of room hosts (RoHos) this
year, Admit Weekend coordinator Kee
gan Livermore 'l6 said that this year's
turnout of RoHos significantly exceed
ed last year's showing. Over 1,000 Ro-
Hos had signed up to host admits by
the end of Spring Break.
According to Matthew Proto, assis
tant dean of admission for marketing
and communications, a total of 1,179
RoHos ultimately signed up and 1,258
ProFros checked in during registra
tion. Proto said that approximately 65
students who checked in did not re
quest an overnight host.
Dean of Freshmen and Undergrad
uate Advising Rob Urstein claimed
that this year's Admit Week
end helped ProFros learn
more about the Stanford
campus and its academic en
vironment.
"I think Admit Weekend
was extremely successful
and helped prospective stu
dents and their families
learn more about the range
and depth of opportunities
and resources available at
Stanford," Urstein said.
"Additionally, it gave them
the chance to get to know
one another and to meet a
lot of the incredible people

who make Stanford the
place it is."
Urstein and Proto credit
ed current Stanford stu
dents who aided the Univer
sity's efforts, whether by
hosting ProFros or showing
them around.
"I was impressed with
the efforts that all of our cur
rent students made to help
these ProFros feel at home
and welcome here," Urstein
said.
Admitted students have
until May 1 to accept the Uni
versity's offer of admission.
