### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
Over 1,200 admitted students ar
rived on campus on April 24 for a rainy
Admit Weekend 2014, which offered
prospective freshmen (ProFros) pro
gramming from Thursday through
Sunday.
This year's programming included
speeches by President John Hennessy,
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2
and Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sion and Financial Aid Richard Shaw;
academic expositions and tours of ath
letic facilities, the Cantor Arts Center
and residence halls; and Friday
evening's annual BROC party.
Although Admit Weekend organiz
ers struggled to recruit a sufficient
number of room hosts (RoHos) this
year, Admit Weekend coordinator Kee
gan Livermore 'l6 said that this year's
turnout of RoHos significantly exceed
ed last year's showing. Over 1,000 Ro-
Hos had signed up to host admits by
the end of Spring Break.
According to Matthew Proto, assis
tant dean of admission for marketing
and communications, a total of 1,179
RoHos ultimately signed up and 1,258
ProFros checked in during registra
tion. Proto said that approximately 65
students who checked in did not re
quest an overnight host.
