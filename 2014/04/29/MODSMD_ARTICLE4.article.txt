## Researchers find walking improves creativity 
### â€” Andrew Vogeley 
The next time a group of entre
preneurial students are struggling
to come up with the next big start
up idea, new research suggests tak
ing a walk might spark some cre
ative juices.
The research, conducted by
Professor of Education Daniel
Schwartz and Marily Oppezzo
Ph.D. 'l3, shows that creativity im
proves while people walk, with indi
viduals also experiencing a small
boost in creativity for a short peri
od after walking.
"Many people anecdotally claim
they do their best thinking when
walking. We finally may be taking a
step, or two, toward discovering
why," Oppezzo and Schwartz wrote
in the study published this week in
the Journal of Experimental Psy
chology: Learning, Memory and
Cognition.
While most past research has
focused on the general long-term
effects of aerobic exercise on cogni
tive ability, Oppezzo and Schwartz's
research is the first to explicitly ex
amine the connection between
walking and creativity.
The researchers tested both
walking outdoors and walking on a
treadmill in a blank room and found
no difference in participants' ability
to think creatively.
"I thought walking outside
would blow everything out of the
water, but walking on a treadmill in
a small, boring room still had
strong results, which surprised
me," Oppezzo told the Stanford
News Service.
With 176 college students and
adults participating in the trials,
the researchers used three ex
periments to gauge creativity us
ing a "divergent thinking" a
thought process in which individ
uals come up with creative ideas
by considering many potential
solutions test.
In these experiments, in
dividuals were given an ob
ject and told to come up with
alternate uses. A response
was considered creative if it
was not given by any of the
other participants.
Walking, however, did not
increase other types of
thinking, showing no posi
tive effect on focused think
ing.
"This isn't to say that
every task at work should be
done while simultaneously
walking, but those that re
quire a fresh perspective or
new ideas would benefit
from it," Oppezzo said.
