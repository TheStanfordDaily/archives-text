## Researchers find walking improves creativity 
### â€” Andrew Vogeley 
The next time a group of entre
preneurial students are struggling
to come up with the next big start
up idea, new research suggests tak
ing a walk might spark some cre

walking. We finally may be taking a
step, or two, toward discovering
why," Oppezzo and Schwartz wrote
in the study published this week in
the Journal of Experimental Psy
chology: Learning, Memory and
Cognition.
While most past research has
focused on the general long-term
effects of aerobic exercise on cogni
tive ability, Oppezzo and Schwartz's
research is the first to explicitly ex
amine the connection between
walking and creativity.
The researchers tested both
walking outdoors and walking on a
treadmill in a blank room and found
no difference in participants' ability
to think creatively.
"I thought walking outside
would blow everything out of the

adults participating in the trials,
the researchers used three ex
periments to gauge creativity us
