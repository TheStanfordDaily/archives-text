## Doonesbury cartoonist speaks as Rathbun Fellow 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
On April 28, the Stanford Office for
Religious Life hosted cartoonist Gary
Trudeau as the fifth Rathbun Visiting
Fellow as he delivered a "Harry's Last
Lecture on a Meaningful Life."
Trudeau is the creator of the Pulitzer
Prize-winning comic strip Doonesbury.
Past Rathbun Fellows have included
Sandra Day O'Connor '5O J.D. '52 and
the Dalai Lama.
Trudeau spoke before a full crowd in
Memorial Auditorium, using his
comedic wit to speak about pivotal
events in his life as well as his personal
growth.
At just eight years of age, Trudeau
recalled, he became enamored with the
energy of theater and took it upon him

self to pursue his dream.
"We rounded up the kids and we put
them in plays," he said. "Initially they
were plays that I wrote, and eventually,
I found out about Samuel French, a pub
lisher of plays. I sent my plays to him
because I wanted to do adult work. I
didn't want to do little kid work."
Trudeau described his generation as
disinclined to remain young and eager
to reach the excitement of adulthood.
However, Trudeau said he never set out
with the intent of adhering strictly to a
predefined plan, and recalled that he did
not have expectations for what was and
was not possible.
"I didn't feel ready for the creative
opportunities that came my way for one
minute," Trudeau said. "I didn't feel

that I could possibly have done
those musicals as a younger
man. I wrote for a column for
the op-ed page of The New
York Times, which was offered
to me in my early forties. I
wasn't ready to do that kind of
work, and I think it took me a
while to think I could write a
show like [Amazon political
sitcom] Alfa House."
Asked how he continues to
live a life of undying passion
with such self-confidence,
Trudeau emphasized "endless
curiosity." Audience members
were taken aback when he
shared his creative process as
an artist.
"There's been a nice align
ment of the opportunities and
my capabilities, but I don't
look too hard at the creative
process â€”like the way a
mountaineer never looks
down," Trudeau said. "You
think maybe that if you hold it
up to too much scrutiny, it
would somehow compromise
the process."
In addition to emphasizing

his curiosity, Trudeau dis
cussed the importance of be
ing an observer in a meaning
ful life and focused on the
quality of empathy. He con
fessed that the one thing he
wished he had done more was
to look less at the horizon and
more at his surroundings.
More than anything else,
Trudeau emphasized the im
portance of life in the present
and the expression of care for
those around you. Trudeau al
so explained his perspective
on his own legacy.
"I think that's really taking
your eye off the ball to worry
about legacy," Trudeau said.
"When I think of legacy, I
think of boxes of things in my
back room that my kids are
going to sort through and
throw out."
Jerry Kwong 'l7 said
Trudeau's talk provided a re
freshing contrast to previous
talks he has attended at Stan
ford this year.
"The last one I came to was
with John Hennessy and
Mark Zuckerberg, and there's
such a humongous contrast,"
Kwong said. "That was some
thing so techie, so current, and
so young and relevant, and
this is something completely

different, much more on the
philosophical side."
Audience members noted
that Trudeau's talk often took
unpredictable turns and devi
ated from the original theme
of a meaningful life.
"You're expecting 'this is
what a meaningful life looks
like,' and it was interesting
that he never explicitly an
swered that," said audience
member Christine Chen 'l7.
One of Trudeau's tangents
included a joke about a man
who went in to see a general
physician. When asked why
he was visiting, the man said
that he thought he was a
moth. To this, the physician
responded that he should go
see a psychiatrist and asked
why the man had visited to be
gin with. The man explained
that he saw the light on.
Trudeau framed the anec
dote as illustrative of a foun
dational concept for a mean
ingful life, arguing that each
of us will have moments when
we see those lights, and we'll
be immediately drawn to
them. The key, he empha
sized, is to not hold back.
