Researchers in Stan
ford's Brains in Silicon Lab,
led by Associate Professor of
Bioengineering Kwabena
Boahen, have developed a
system of chips that mimic
the computing structure and
process of the human brain.
The chips, which are cus
tom-designed by the lab, are
called "Neurocores." They
simulate over 6,000 individ
ual neurons and many more
synaptic, or inter-neural,
connections and were de
signed with the aim of in
creased power efficiency as
compared to existing chips.

The researchers com
bined the chips, whose devel
opment was funded by the
National Institutes of
Health (NIH), in an inter
linked grid of 16 chips (called
"Neurogrid"), which aims to
mimic the human mind by
simulating a network of one
million neurons and several
billion synaptic connections.
The design, which per
mits certain synapses to
share hardware circuits, al
lows the Neurogrid device to
operate with the same com
puting power and be the
same size as an Apple iPad.
However, the design also re
quires knowledge of the
brain to effectively leverage
the neural network. In the
future, the lab aims to create
a neurocompiler to compile
computer code so that the
network can run it more effi
ciently.
