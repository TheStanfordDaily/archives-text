## Student-athletes restricted by the NCAA 
### Cameron Miller 
In response to my initial column
lambasting the NCAA for its
backwards relationship with its
athletes, my colleague at The
Daily, Joey Beyda, penned a
well-written rebuttal piece in which
he argued that "student-athletes"
should not have a cut in the exorbi
tant revenues their talent, skill and
hard work secure. Fbrthermore, he
claimed that allowing these individu
als to privately profit off of their like
ness or performance would simply
exacerbate "the same income in
equality that plagues our country to
day."
Let me preface my own rebuttal
by saying that I have immense re
spect for Joey's dedication and the
body of work he's produced at The
Daily. He's been a sports desk editor
a thankless job for too many
volumes to count and continues to be
the leader behind The Daily's transi
tion to its new website design. If
there's anyone I want emulate in my
remaining time as a Daily sports
staffer, it's Joey Beyda; his influence
on this paper will be felt for years to
come.
Now that I have dispensed with
the pleasantries, it's time to get down
to business... to defeat Mr. Beyda.
I vehemently disagree with Joey's
assertion that the current NCAA
rules disallowing athletes from taking
to the free market and attempting to
profit from their skills, likenesses and
autographs should remain en
trenched. Not only are these restric
tions unfair, they are unjust more
so than denying players a slim cut of
the ballooning television revenue
their games rake in.

First, no other students on cam
pus are restricted and held down like
"student-athletes" are. If computer
science phenoms want to accept a
sponsorship deal from a software
company, they are free to do so. If
chemistry whizzes want to get paid
for a talk they might give to elemen
tary school students on the impor
tance of the sciences, there's nothing
stopping them. If English majors that
have just written best-selling novels
want to do a book signing, they don't
have to be wary of a multi-billion dol
lar "non-profit" swooping in from
above and suspending then* writing
privileges.
So god forbid that we allow John
ny Football to sign some mini-hel
mets, or Terrelle Pryor to trade
memorabilia for tattoos or this writer
to be an extra in a movie about long
distance running. Yes, I'm still angry
about that.
Point being, if other students can
take their talents to the free market,
why shouldn't the NCAA athlete be
allowed to do the same?
Second, Joey's example of a "play
er from poor roots but with a 2350
SAT score" that chooses "the option
that increases my short-term expo
sure" drips with a paternalistic flavor
I cannot stomach. Mr. Beyda assumes
and we all know what that does
that the draw of a football-crazy Okla
homan environment will be more en
ticing than the world-class education
a player could take advantage of at
Stanford. This assumption discredits
the individual's ability to gauge what
decision is truly the best one for him:
It may be the path that leads to im
mediate gratification or the one
comes with a delayed reward.
But who are you to say that one
choice is better for him than the oth
er? That's for the individual to decide,
not Mr. Beyda or anyone else, for
that matter. And if the kid has a 2350
SAT score, he's likely to have the abil
ity to think critically and make the
right choice about which situation
in Norman or Palo Alto—will benefit
him the most in the long-run. So don't
assume that just because of his back-

students on
campus are
restricted and
held down like
"student
athletes" are.

ground he'll choose "unwise
ly." It's not our responsibility
to pass judgment on the deci
sions of others.
Lastly, on the topic of in
creasing existing inequality, I
understand Joey's concern. If
players are allowed to profit
from their likeness and per
formances, athletic depart
ments and associated boosters
will be able to throw the full
weight of their financial re
sources at recruits in order to
influence a decision. This
could allow the fiscally domi
nant programs to land even

more prized recruits than
they otherwise would, leaving
smaller schools out in the cold.
But that's the inevitable re
sult of laissez-faire, free-mar
ket capitalism: some win and
some lose. The strong do what
they can, and the weak suffer
what they must.
And there's nothing we
should do to tamper with that.

Cameron Miller was furious
when he learned that his own
colleague, Joey Beyda, took
the role, of "Background Run
ner #5" that he so desperately
wanted. To give Cameron
