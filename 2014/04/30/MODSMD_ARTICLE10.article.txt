# WEDNESDAY ROUNDTABLE
## TALKING NFL IMPACT OF CARDINAL STARS 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
Last week, the roundtable
talked about which new Stanford
football recruit would make the
biggest immediate impact at the
collegiate level. This week, we'll
take it one step farther as we ask
football writers Joseph Beyda,
Michael Peterson and Vihan
Lakshman: which departing
Stanford football player is
primed to make the biggest im
mediate impact at the profes
sional level next season ?
Joseph: "Impact" is a funny word.
For one, I'm tempted to pick Cameron
Fleming, given the one-year trend for
former Cardinal tackles to have a
monumental (albeit unintentional) im
pact on the NFL.
Many mock drafts have Fleming
listed as the first Stanford player off
the board, though, so I'd be utterly re
miss to bring up the three-year
starter without giving him his due
credit. Leaving the film work to those
much more qualified than myself, it
seems that the scout on Fleming is
that his size and power will serve him
well in the NFL, but that his mobility
might not stack up against that of the
talented tackles he'll be competing
against for playing time, possibly forc
ing him to move away from the posi
tion he has anchored on the Farm.

Yet I hesitate to bet against the
most experienced member of an of
fensive line that only took two holding
penalties in the regular season last
year, and that averaged a paltry 1.15
sacks per Fleming start over the last
three seasons. When it comes to agili
ty, Fleming already has shown
progress, improving his vertical jump
by two inches in the four weeks be
tween the NFL Combine and Stan
ford's pro day. And Fleming should
blow away the competition when it
comes to picking up whatever the next
level throws his way. Don't forget, he's
literally a rocket scientist.

Michael: Fleming and David
Yankey will likely be the first two
Stanford players picked in the draft,
but I like Ed Reynolds' chances at
succeeding early in his NFL career.
After Reynolds' wildly successful
junior year, he was projected to be the
first safety taken in the 2013 NFL
Draft, potentially in the first round,
had he declared and left Stanford.
However, after a "down" statistical
season, Reynolds dropped to a fourth
round projection, according to CBS
Sports. The supposedly down year, in
my opinion, was due more to the re
spect other teams showed in throwing
away from Reynolds (targeting the
cornerbacks instead) than to poor
performance.


ZETONG LI/The Stanford Daily
Senior offensive tackle Cameron Fleming (center), a three-year starter for the
Cardinal - a span in which the team has clinched BCS bowl appearances
each season - will look to improve an NFL team's roster after being drafted
this May. Stanford tackles have had a big impact at the pro level in the past.
