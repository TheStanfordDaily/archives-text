# WEDNESDAY ROUNDTABLE
## TALKING NFL IMPACT OF CARDINAL STARS 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
Last week, the roundtable
talked about which new Stanford
football recruit would make the
biggest immediate impact at the
collegiate level. This week, we'll
take it one step farther as we ask
football writers Joseph Beyda,
Michael Peterson and Vihan
Lakshman: which departing
Stanford football player is
primed to make the biggest im
mediate impact at the profes
sional level next season ?
Joseph: "Impact" is a funny word.
For one, I'm tempted to pick Cameron
Fleming, given the one-year trend for
former Cardinal tackles to have a
monumental (albeit unintentional) im
pact on the NFL.
Many mock drafts have Fleming
listed as the first Stanford player off
the board, though, so I'd be utterly re
miss to bring up the three-year
starter without giving him his due
credit. Leaving the film work to those
much more qualified than myself, it
seems that the scout on Fleming is
that his size and power will serve him
well in the NFL, but that his mobility
might not stack up against that of the
talented tackles he'll be competing
against for playing time, possibly forc
ing him to move away from the posi
tion he has anchored on the Farm.

Yet I hesitate to bet against the
most experienced member of an of
fensive line that only took two holding
penalties in the regular season last
year, and that averaged a paltry 1.15
sacks per Fleming start over the last
three seasons. When it comes to agili
ty, Fleming already has shown
progress, improving his vertical jump
by two inches in the four weeks be
tween the NFL Combine and Stan
ford's pro day. And Fleming should
blow away the competition when it
comes to picking up whatever the next
level throws his way. Don't forget, he's
literally a rocket scientist.

Michael: Fleming and David
Yankey will likely be the first two
Stanford players picked in the draft,
but I like Ed Reynolds' chances at
succeeding early in his NFL career.
After Reynolds' wildly successful
junior year, he was projected to be the
first safety taken in the 2013 NFL
Draft, potentially in the first round,
had he declared and left Stanford.
However, after a "down" statistical
season, Reynolds dropped to a fourth
round projection, according to CBS
Sports. The supposedly down year, in
my opinion, was due more to the re
spect other teams showed in throwing
away from Reynolds (targeting the
cornerbacks instead) than to poor
performance.

Senior offensive tackle Cameron Fleming (center), a three-year starter for the
Cardinal - a span in which the team has clinched BCS bowl appearances
each season - will look to improve an NFL team's roster after being drafted
this May. Stanford tackles have had a big impact at the pro level in the past.
Reynolds possesses the
ball-hawking skills neces
sary to disrupt opposing
quarterbacks, having
recorded six interceptions
his junior year. At 6-foot-2,
he also has the size to cover
tight ends from the safety
position obviously not
matching tight ends in
height, but you won't see a
much bigger safety. What he
lacks in speed he makes up
for in physicality, constantly
stepping in for the big hit
and providing an extra run
stopper in the secondary.
In the right situation
with another reliable safety,
maybe with a team like
Green Bay, which needs a
free safety to complement
strong safety Morgan Bur
nett, Reynolds could thrive
if he's given the freedom to
range throughout the sec
ondary like he had at Stan
ford. I could see Reynolds
turning into a dynamic
starter fairly quickly.

Vihan: This is a very
tough question to answer at
this point in time because
the chances of any Stanford
prospect making an immedi
ate impact depend a lot on
the specific system of the
team that drafts him as well
as the caliber of players he
will have to compete against
to earn playing time. Trent
Murphy is a great example
because he could be drafted
as a defensive end in a 4-3
scheme or as an outside line
backer in a 3-4 (which he
played at Stanford). Never
theless, in spite of the uncer
tainty regarding his future
position, I think Murphy is

primed to make the biggest
impact because of his pass
rushing skills and ability to
play special teams.
Murphy's stock has
slipped in the pre-draft
process significantly: He has
gone from being a potential
first round pick to a likely
fourth-rounder. While his
NCAA-leading 15 sacks last
season speak for themselves,
many scouts and executives
feel that Murphy lacks the
athleticism and explosive
ness necessary to become an
NFL starter. However, Mur
phy makes up for any per
ceived lack of athleticism
with his extremely high foot
ball intelligence and his ar
ray of subtle pass-rushing
moves. There are very few, if
any, teams with too many
pass rushers. With the NFL
becoming an increasingly
pass-happy league, there
should be a demand for Mur
phy's services and he has
shown that he can deliver in
big-time situations.
Furthermore, Murphy
could make an impact on
Sundays as a special teams
player if he does not earn a
starting spot on defense.
With his long reach and abil
ity to get into the backfield,
Murphy could thrive on the
field goal block unit, as he
did on the Farm. With this
added dimension that he can
bring to an NFL team, Mur
phy clearly has the inside
track to make the biggest
impact right away out of all
the Stanford prospects in
the 2014 Draft.

first safety taken in the 2013 NFL
Draft, potentially in the first round,
had he declared and left Stanford.
However, after a "down" statistical
season, Reynolds dropped to a fourth
round projection, according to CBS
Sports. The supposedly down year, in
my opinion, was due more to the re
spect other teams showed in throwing
away from Reynolds (targeting the
cornerbacks instead) than to poor
performance.

Senior offensive tackle Cameron Fleming (center), a three-year starter for the
Cardinal - a span in which the team has clinched BCS bowl appearances
each season - will look to improve an NFL team's roster after being drafted
this May. Stanford tackles have had a big impact at the pro level in the past.
Reynolds possesses the
ball-hawking skills neces
sary to disrupt opposing
quarterbacks, having
recorded six interceptions
his junior year. At 6-foot-2,
he also has the size to cover
tight ends from the safety
position obviously not
matching tight ends in
height, but you won't see a
much bigger safety. What he
lacks in speed he makes up
for in physicality, constantly
stepping in for the big hit
and providing an extra run
stopper in the secondary.
In the right situation
with another reliable safety,
maybe with a team like
Green Bay, which needs a
free safety to complement
strong safety Morgan Bur
nett, Reynolds could thrive
if he's given the freedom to
range throughout the sec
ondary like he had at Stan
ford. I could see Reynolds
turning into a dynamic
starter fairly quickly.

Vihan: This is a very
tough question to answer at
this point in time because
the chances of any Stanford
prospect making an immedi
ate impact depend a lot on
the specific system of the
team that drafts him as well
as the caliber of players he
will have to compete against
to earn playing time. Trent
Murphy is a great example
because he could be drafted
as a defensive end in a 4-3
scheme or as an outside line
backer in a 3-4 (which he
played at Stanford). Never
theless, in spite of the uncer
tainty regarding his future
position, I think Murphy is

primed to make the biggest
impact because of his pass
rushing skills and ability to
play special teams.
Murphy's stock has
slipped in the pre-draft
process significantly: He has
gone from being a potential
first round pick to a likely
fourth-rounder. While his
NCAA-leading 15 sacks last
season speak for themselves,
many scouts and executives
feel that Murphy lacks the
athleticism and explosive
ness necessary to become an
NFL starter. However, Mur
phy makes up for any per
ceived lack of athleticism
with his extremely high foot
ball intelligence and his ar
ray of subtle pass-rushing
moves. There are very few, if
any, teams with too many
pass rushers. With the NFL
becoming an increasingly
pass-happy league, there
should be a demand for Mur
phy's services and he has
shown that he can deliver in
big-time situations.
Furthermore, Murphy
could make an impact on
Sundays as a special teams
player if he does not earn a
starting spot on defense.
With his long reach and abil
ity to get into the backfield,
Murphy could thrive on the
field goal block unit, as he
did on the Farm. With this
added dimension that he can
bring to an NFL team, Mur
phy clearly has the inside
track to make the biggest
impact right away out of all
the Stanford prospects in
the 2014 Draft.

Last week, the roundtable
talked about which new Stanford
football recruit would make the
biggest immediate impact at the
collegiate level. This week, we'll
take it one step farther as we ask
football writers Joseph Beyda,
Michael Peterson and Vihan
Lakshman: which departing
Stanford football player is
primed to make the biggest im
mediate impact at the profes
sional level next season ?
Joseph: "Impact" is a funny word.
For one, I'm tempted to pick Cameron
Fleming, given the one-year trend for
former Cardinal tackles to have a
monumental (albeit unintentional) im
pact on the NFL.
Many mock drafts have Fleming
listed as the first Stanford player off
the board, though, so I'd be utterly re
miss to bring up the three-year
starter without giving him his due
credit. Leaving the film work to those
much more qualified than myself, it
seems that the scout on Fleming is
that his size and power will serve him
well in the NFL, but that his mobility
might not stack up against that of the
talented tackles he'll be competing
against for playing time, possibly forc
ing him to move away from the posi
tion he has anchored on the Farm.

Yet I hesitate to bet against the
most experienced member of an of
fensive line that only took two holding
penalties in the regular season last
year, and that averaged a paltry 1.15
sacks per Fleming start over the last
three seasons. When it comes to agili
ty, Fleming already has shown
progress, improving his vertical jump
by two inches in the four weeks be
tween the NFL Combine and Stan
ford's pro day. And Fleming should
blow away the competition when it
comes to picking up whatever the next
level throws his way. Don't forget, he's
literally a rocket scientist.

Michael: Fleming and David
Yankey will likely be the first two
Stanford players picked in the draft,
but I like Ed Reynolds' chances at
succeeding early in his NFL career.
After Reynolds' wildly successful
junior year, he was projected to be the
first safety taken in the 2013 NFL
Draft, potentially in the first round,
