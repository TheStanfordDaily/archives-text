Playing for the fourth
straight day, Stanford base

stood a late rally from non
conference opponent Pacific
(23-22,12-9 WCC) to seal a 3-

climbed back to .500 with the

pick up two hits in the final
five innings.
One of those hits came in
the sixth inning off of the bat
of freshman Tommy Edman,
who knocked a two-run bases
