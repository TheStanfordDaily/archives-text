## Cardinal edge Pacific on road Edman pushes team to .500 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Playing for the fourth
straight day, Stanford base
ball (19-19, 7-11 Pac-12) with
stood a late rally from non
conference opponent Pacific
(23-22,12-9 WCC) to seal a 3-
2 victory on the road. Stanford
climbed back to .500 with the
win, the sixth time this season
the Cardinal have been at the
middle mark even though
they have yet to break past
the barrier, having lost all five
previous times they have
stood at .500.

Although the bats were
relatively quiet for the Cardi
nal, stellar pitching from
sophomore Logan James and
solid work in relief from fresh
men Chris Viall and Chris
Castellanos combined to bring

home the victory, which is on
ly the fourth time this season
the team has won when scor
ing three or less runs.
James started on the
mound for the first time this
season and threw four score
less innings, allowing only a
single hit. His start was only
the fourth start of the season
not made by a freshman, with
the other three coming from
junior John Hochstatter.
James also tied his career
high with five strikeouts.
Stanford struck early in
the top of the first inning
when junior Alex Blandino
doubled down the left field
line, bringing home senior
Brett Michael Doran for the
first run of the game. Al
though they continued to
threaten early on with four
more hits in the next three in
nings, the Cardinal would only
pick up two hits in the final
five innings.
One of those hits came in
the sixth inning off of the bat
of freshman Tommy Edman,
who knocked a two-run bases
loaded single through the
right side, extending Stan

ford's lead to 3-0. Edman has
now hit in nine straight
games with 13 total hits in
that streak.
In the seventh inning, Pa
cific threatened with two hits
and a walk to load the bases
with only one out. An RBI
groundout brought home Pa
cific's first run of the game,
but Castellanos, who entered
in relief of Viall in the inning,
then locked down and
stranded runners at second
and third.
Even with their backs
against the wall, the Tigers
again rallied with back-to
back doubles from senior
Erik Lockwood and fresh
man Parker Klein with two
outs in the ninth inning to cut
the deficit to 3-2. Castellanos
quelled the Cardinal's fears,
though, by inducing a lineout

to again strand a runner in
scoring position and clinch
the victory for the Card.
Stanford improved to 8-0
in its non-conference mid
week games this season and
has now won seven of its last
10 games overall. On the oth
er side, Pacific dropped its
second consecutive contest
after winning 10 of its previ
ous 11.
Every non-conference
game is essentially a must
win at this point in the sea
son for Stanford, which
dropped six spots to 34th in
the nation in RPI when the
new rankings were released
on Tuesday. With the Card
fighting on the bubble for a
postseason berth, a loss to
an opponent from a weak
conference could damage
their resume beyond repair.
Stanford resumes play
on Friday at 6 p.m. when it
faces UCLA in Los Angeles.
