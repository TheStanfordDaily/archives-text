## Non-conference slate wraps up 
### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford softball team
(27-21,3-15 Pac-12) will look to
close out its regular-season
non-conference slate with a
strong showing tonight
against the Saint Mary's Gaels
(22-22, 8-4 WCC) in Moraga,
California. Saint Mary's cer
tainly enters Wednesday's
contest with the momentum,
as the Gaels just capped off a
road sweep of Bay Aa-ea rival
Santa Clara. In contrast, the
Cardinal will make the trip
coming off a sweep at the
hands of consensus No. 1 Ore
gon.
The Gaels present a dan
gerous matchup for the Card,

as SMC has already knocked
off one Pac-12 foe the Gaels
picked up their first-ever win
over Cal in February when
they stunned the then-No. 23
Golden Bears 4-1 as part of the
Campbell/Cartier Classic.
SMU then followed up that
early season victory over Cal
with another win over the
Golden Bears on April 9.
The Gaels have a very
young squad that continues to
develop at the plate, with a de
cent team batting average of
.260. However, SMC has
struggled to consistently put
runs on the scoreboard in
2014, as Saint Mary's is only
averaging slightly more than
three runs per game. The
Gaels have also lacked pow
er hitting for most of the
season, with only 14 home
runs in 44 games this year.
Saint Mary's is led on of
fense by sophomore Andrea
Hazel. The Yuba City, Cali
fornia, native holds the high
mark in several offensive
categories for the Gaels, in
cluding batting average
(.340), RBIs (19), home runs
(5), and slugging percentage
(.564). In short, Hazel has
had a breakout year for
Saint Mary's in 2014 after
only hitting .163 with 12
RBIs as a true freshman.
However, in spite of her
struggles last season, she
did homer in the Gaels' 5-2
upset of the Cardinal last
April.
Stanford will also have to
be mindful of sophomore
Cassidy Szeredy when the
Pittsburg, California, prod
uct steps to the plate. Sz
eredy, who was a high school
teammate of Stanford desig
nated player and pitcher Ty
lyn Wells, has hit .297 with
five doubles, two home runs,
and nine RBIs. She has also
been very successful at
drawing free passes, with a
team-leading 17 walks to
boost her on-base percent
age to a .418 mark.
In the circle, the Gaels
are anchored by sophomore
ace Lujane Mussadi. Mussa
di, a local of Los Gatos, Cali
fornia, has posted a solid
2.56 ERA in 17 starts and 25
appearances. Mussadi has
failed to get very much run
support from her offense, as
the sophomore only has a 9-

8 record on the season. How
ever, she has been able to do
the heavy lifting in the circle
for the second straight sea
son, having pitched 109.1 of
the Gaels' 222 total innings.
Saint Mary's may also
possibly turn to junior Sarah
Lira against the Cardinal, as
the Gilroy, California, native
has done a solid job as a sec
ond starter for the Gaels. In
87.1 innings pitched, Lira
has posted a strong 2.24
ERA in 20 appearances and
seven starts. She is a very
versatile player she
starts at first base during
the games that she does not
pitch. Finally, Lira has hit
.291 with 2 home runs and 8
RBIs in 86 total at-bats this
season.
Stanford head coach
John Rittman described the
upcoming game against
Saint Mary's as an impor
tant test for his team,
adding, "The Saint Mary's
game is a mid-week game
against a team that has been
very competitive. We have to
bring our A-game against
them, and we do not want to
overlook them for UCLA."
Stanford and Saint
Mary's will square off at
Cottrell Field on Wednesday
at 3 p.m. After the contest,
the Cardinal will travel to
Los Angeles to take on No. 2
UCLA in the second-to-last
series of conference play.
