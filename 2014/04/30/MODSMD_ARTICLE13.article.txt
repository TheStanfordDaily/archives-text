## SEEING GREEN Weather or not 
### Holly Moeller 
You don't have to know me well
to know that I don't like deer.
It's been too many years
since I watched Bambi and too few
since I last walked through a forest
whose next generation of seedlings
had been devoured by an overpopu
lation of deer. And when it comes to
the choice between doe-eyed rumi
nants and baby trees, well, I tend to
side with the baby trees.
But there is one species of deer
that warms my heart every time I
see it: The Florida Key Deer, whose
miniature size and disproportionate
boldness could endear it to even the
coldest heart.

And, if the climate models are to
be believed, the Key deer might not
be around for long enough to cause
much ecological harm, anyway.
As its name suggests, the Key
deer is a denizen of the Florida
Keys, the string of low-lying islands
arcing into the Caribbean off the
southern tip of the Sunshine State.
A vacation-goer's paradise for their
umbrella drinks and ample water
sports, the Keys are also something
of a homeowner's nightmare be
cause their low-lying coastal prop
erties are frequently awash in hur
ricane storm surges.
These periodic inundations are
likely to become more frequent
with human-driven climate change.
Human carbon dioxide emissions
trap sun energy within Earth's at
mosphere, slowly warming the
planet. This leads to sea level rise
for two reasons. First, warmer wa
ter takes up more space, so the
oceans which are warming
alongside the atmosphere are
expanding. Second, warmer global
temperatures lead to melting of
glaciers and ice sheets, releasing
once-frozen water back into the
ocean and further raising sea sur
face levels.
All this means that the Florida
Keys where 90 percent of land is
within five feet of the present-day
sea level are at major risk. And,
along with billions of dollars in
coastal property, the Key deer's
habitat could soon be sinking un
derwater.
So the Key deer, squeezed onto
tinier and tinier fragments of land,
is likely to become one of the most
obvious though hardly unique
victims of anthropogenic climate
change. Many other species, unable
to reach a new habitat as their ex
isting ones become too salty, too hot
or too dry, will face a similar fate.
That is, unless we choose to save
them.
Even if we fail to deal with cli
mate change, managed relocation
physically distributing members
of at-risk species to new, potentially
suitable habitats could help at
least a few species escape extinc
tion. But both the scientific feasibil
ity of relocation and the ethical im
plications remain unknown.
From a scientific perspective,
predicting a species' future home
range is no simple task. Climate en
velope models (CEMs) attempt to
match what we know about an or
ganism's biology (i.e., the tempera
ture at which an alligator egg
should incubate or the amount of
rainfall a plant requires) with what
we predict about future climate
regimes. Though CEMs are the

best tools we have at the moment,
they've been roundly criticized for
their heavy burden of uncertainty.
And managers are especially leery
of risking rare conservation dollars
and rarer species members on a
wild goose chase for a future habi
tat.
On the other side of the coin,
managed relocation represents a
new direction in conservation
thinking. While it's easy to operate
from a "preservationist" perspec
tive trying to leave Nature rela
tively undamaged by human activi
ty; doing some remediation and set
ting aside parks and preserves
managed relocation is inherently
an "interventionist" approach that
involves deliberate human modifi
cations to an environment by
adding in a new species. And, as we
know from an abundance of experi
ence with invasive species, such ad
ditions, whether intentional or acci
dental, may have major negative
consequences. An attempt to save
one species could unhinge an entire
ecosystem.
These caveats haven't stopped
either conservation groups or re
source managers from going ahead
with some relocations, however.
And really, such relocations aren't
so different from the myriad of
species introductions humankind
has done throughout the course of
our highly migratory history We
are the great planetary homogeniz
ers, bringing our favorite food
crops, pets, landscaping trees and
livestock with us where we go.
Plenty of pestilential hangers-on
(like rats and mosquitoes) have
come along for the ride, too.
Just as in the past, these delib
erate species introductions will be
done based on human wants and
desires. Species will be saved in
proportion to their charisma (think
doe-eyed Key deer) and economic
utility (think Tasmanian crayfish
and Pacific Northwest forestry).
We may try to employ some scien
tific methods to increase our proba
bility of success, but in the end de
cisions will be made based on hu
man self-interest, not ecological
foresight. And the rest of the
species, critical though they may be
to ecosystem functioning, will be
left behind to weather the storm.

It's been too many years
since I watched Bambi and too few
since I last walked through a forest
whose next generation of seedlings
had been devoured by an overpopu
lation of deer. And when it comes to
the choice between doe-eyed rumi
nants and baby trees, well, I tend to
side with the baby trees.
But there is one species of deer
that warms my heart every time I
see it: The Florida Key Deer, whose
miniature size and disproportionate
boldness could endear it to even the
coldest heart.

And, if the climate models are to
be believed, the Key deer might not
be around for long enough to cause
much ecological harm, anyway.
As its name suggests, the Key
deer is a denizen of the Florida
Keys, the string of low-lying islands
arcing into the Caribbean off the
southern tip of the Sunshine State.
A vacation-goer's paradise for their
umbrella drinks and ample water
sports, the Keys are also something
of a homeowner's nightmare be
cause their low-lying coastal prop
erties are frequently awash in hur
ricane storm surges.
These periodic inundations are
likely to become more frequent
with human-driven climate change.
Human carbon dioxide emissions
trap sun energy within Earth's at
mosphere, slowly warming the
planet. This leads to sea level rise
for two reasons. First, warmer wa
ter takes up more space, so the
oceans which are warming
alongside the atmosphere are
expanding. Second, warmer global
temperatures lead to melting of
glaciers and ice sheets, releasing
once-frozen water back into the
ocean and further raising sea sur
face levels.
All this means that the Florida
Keys where 90 percent of land is
within five feet of the present-day
sea level are at major risk. And,
along with billions of dollars in
coastal property, the Key deer's
habitat could soon be sinking un
derwater.
So the Key deer, squeezed onto
tinier and tinier fragments of land,
is likely to become one of the most
obvious though hardly unique
victims of anthropogenic climate
change. Many other species, unable
to reach a new habitat as their ex
isting ones become too salty, too hot
or too dry, will face a similar fate.
That is, unless we choose to save
them.
Even if we fail to deal with cli
mate change, managed relocation
physically distributing members
of at-risk species to new, potentially
suitable habitats could help at
least a few species escape extinc
tion. But both the scientific feasibil
ity of relocation and the ethical im
plications remain unknown.
From a scientific perspective,
predicting a species' future home
range is no simple task. Climate en
velope models (CEMs) attempt to
match what we know about an or
ganism's biology (i.e., the tempera
ture at which an alligator egg
should incubate or the amount of
rainfall a plant requires) with what
we predict about future climate
regimes. Though CEMs are the

best tools we have at the moment,
they've been roundly criticized for
their heavy burden of uncertainty.
And managers are especially leery
of risking rare conservation dollars
and rarer species members on a
wild goose chase for a future habi
tat.
On the other side of the coin,
managed relocation represents a
new direction in conservation
thinking. While it's easy to operate
from a "preservationist" perspec
tive trying to leave Nature rela
tively undamaged by human activi
ty; doing some remediation and set
ting aside parks and preserves
managed relocation is inherently
an "interventionist" approach that
involves deliberate human modifi
cations to an environment by
adding in a new species. And, as we
know from an abundance of experi
ence with invasive species, such ad
ditions, whether intentional or acci
dental, may have major negative
consequences. An attempt to save
one species could unhinge an entire
ecosystem.
These caveats haven't stopped
either conservation groups or re
source managers from going ahead
with some relocations, however.
And really, such relocations aren't
so different from the myriad of
species introductions humankind
has done throughout the course of
our highly migratory history We
are the great planetary homogeniz
ers, bringing our favorite food
crops, pets, landscaping trees and
livestock with us where we go.
Plenty of pestilential hangers-on
(like rats and mosquitoes) have
come along for the ride, too.
Just as in the past, these delib
erate species introductions will be
done based on human wants and
desires. Species will be saved in
proportion to their charisma (think
doe-eyed Key deer) and economic
utility (think Tasmanian crayfish
and Pacific Northwest forestry).
We may try to employ some scien
tific methods to increase our proba
bility of success, but in the end de
cisions will be made based on hu
man self-interest, not ecological
foresight. And the rest of the
species, critical though they may be
to ecosystem functioning, will be
left behind to weather the storm.
