# RE-BOARDER AT LARGE
## Synergy FAQ: The meanest concerns about the nicest house 
### Liam Kinney 
The other day I was at a small
get-together in a friend's
apartment, catching up with
friends in my major over EANABs
and Easter chocolates. At some
point, someone asked, "How was
your weekend?" and I commented
how much fun the Synergy beach
trip had been last weekend. The
person I was talking with scoffed
and laughed. Before I knew it, the
room morphed into a kind of re
verse intervention: as people in
turn stated their reasons for fear
ing association with Synergy, I
sought to explain how they were
misguided or overly dismissive.
This instance was not the first time
I'd heard these complaints, and it
won't be the last. Hopefully, in hon
or of the draw season, I can nip
some such misconceptions in the
bud with my next two articles:
"Ughh, that hill"
Synergy is exactly 53 feet above
Campus Drive. If you've ever
climbed to the garden-roof of Her
rin Hall, it's easier than that. The
isolation, by the way, is what makes
it such a nice and quiet living space.
"Synergy is crazy"
Unless you have friends in Syn
ergy, the only reason you would
ever make that Everestian trek is

for the infamous Halloween party.
On that night, whatever may hap
pen, the opinion (lore? rumor?) of
Synergy is shaped in the minds of
the freshmen (who become the
sophomores, and the seniors, etc.).
Synergy is that nocturnal Addams
Family mansion on the hill, rapt in
perpetual bass, where someone saw
someone forcing a mixed drink on a
supine freshman like Harry on
Dumbledore in the beginning of the
Half Blood Prince. Yeah ... no.
Synergy is one of the most
serene houses on campus. It is the
only "Row" house completely sur
rounded by trees to the point
that we can't hear the cars on Cam
pus Drive or Mayfield Row. The
house's strict quiet hours (11-9 on
weeknights, 1-11 on weekends, en
forced every night but Halloween)
quash any attempts at fratting. As
I write this article, I am sitting on
one of our three sunny porches, lis
tening to the birds as my roommate
plays one-on-one soccer on our
lawn.
In fact, many Synergy residents
dislike our Halloween party. On
that night, there are people run
ning up and down the halls, de
stroying the bathrooms and floors
(which the residents clean, not
ResEd, remember?), and the resi
dents have no control over when

they can go to sleep. It's downright
exhausting.
"Aren't there animals there?"
Not, like, jaguars and tarantu
las. Synergy has six friendly chick
ens. A couple of our house jobs
(some of the most desirable ones, in
fact) are dedicated to taking care of
the chickens and it's actually pretty
relaxing to grab some feed and go
talk with them for a bit. Our ani
mals are the reason people visit, not
the reason they stay away.
"Aren't there, like, seven people
to a room?"
People find this notion terrify
ing, but a lot of people, including
me, love it. The communes, as
they're called, are the pride of both
Synergy and Columbae.
Part of the intentional and con
sensual community is feeling com
fortable about where you live. So,
every quarter we have "rooming
meeting," during which people can
rethink (or not rethink; two guys
have lived in the same double all
three quarters) their living situa
tion. One of the options for living is
a commune, in which a five-plus
group of people can elect to have
two rooms, one of which is used for
sleeping and the other for socializ
ing/studying.

Although some people find this
system scary, it's actually quite
flexible and convenient. Because of
the social room, you never have to
work quietly in deference to your
roommates. In addition, having a
space that's dedicated entirely to
socializing (i.e. no bulky beds lying
around) allows for more creativity
with the setup: Every quarter, I've
had a projector and two couches in
my room. Because of the fluid
roommate situation, residents end
up meeting and bonding with more
people in the house, which makes
for a much more cohesive commu
nity. I myself have roomed with
nine separate people during my
time here, quite happily.
"Why would I cook and clean for
myself?"
Well, you're going to be doing
exactly that after you graduate, so
why not start learning now? I have
learned a number of healthy easy
recipes at Synergy that I know will
save me from going out for food lat
er in life. And because everyone is
cooking for themselves here, the
food is usually really good.
Why would you clean for your
self? Try not to roll your eyes when
I say that cleaning jobs have been
