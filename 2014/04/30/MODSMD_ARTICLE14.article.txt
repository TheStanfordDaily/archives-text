# RE-BOARDER AT LARGE
## Synergy FAQ: The meanest concerns about the nicest house 
### Liam Kinney 
The other day I was at a small
get-together in a friend's
apartment, catching up with
friends in my major over EANABs
and Easter chocolates. At some
point, someone asked, "How was
your weekend?" and I commented
how much fun the Synergy beach
trip had been last weekend. The
person I was talking with scoffed
and laughed. Before I knew it, the
room morphed into a kind of re
verse intervention: as people in
turn stated their reasons for fear
ing association with Synergy, I
sought to explain how they were
misguided or overly dismissive.
This instance was not the first time
I'd heard these complaints, and it
won't be the last. Hopefully, in hon
or of the draw season, I can nip
some such misconceptions in the
bud with my next two articles:
"Ughh, that hill"
Synergy is exactly 53 feet above
Campus Drive. If you've ever
climbed to the garden-roof of Her
rin Hall, it's easier than that. The
isolation, by the way, is what makes
it such a nice and quiet living space.
"Synergy is crazy"
Unless you have friends in Syn
ergy, the only reason you would
ever make that Everestian trek is

for the infamous Halloween party.
On that night, whatever may hap
pen, the opinion (lore? rumor?) of
Synergy is shaped in the minds of
the freshmen (who become the
sophomores, and the seniors, etc.).
Synergy is that nocturnal Addams
Family mansion on the hill, rapt in
perpetual bass, where someone saw
someone forcing a mixed drink on a
supine freshman like Harry on
Dumbledore in the beginning of the
Half Blood Prince. Yeah ... no.
Synergy is one of the most
serene houses on campus. It is the
only "Row" house completely sur
rounded by trees to the point
that we can't hear the cars on Cam
pus Drive or Mayfield Row. The
house's strict quiet hours (11-9 on
weeknights, 1-11 on weekends, en
forced every night but Halloween)
quash any attempts at fratting. As
I write this article, I am sitting on
one of our three sunny porches, lis
tening to the birds as my roommate
plays one-on-one soccer on our
lawn.
In fact, many Synergy residents
dislike our Halloween party. On
that night, there are people run
ning up and down the halls, de
stroying the bathrooms and floors
(which the residents clean, not
ResEd, remember?), and the resi
dents have no control over when

they can go to sleep. It's downright
exhausting.
"Aren't there animals there?"
Not, like, jaguars and tarantu
las. Synergy has six friendly chick
ens. A couple of our house jobs
(some of the most desirable ones, in
fact) are dedicated to taking care of
the chickens and it's actually pretty
relaxing to grab some feed and go
talk with them for a bit. Our ani
mals are the reason people visit, not
the reason they stay away.
"Aren't there, like, seven people
to a room?"
People find this notion terrify
ing, but a lot of people, including
me, love it. The communes, as
they're called, are the pride of both
Synergy and Columbae.
Part of the intentional and con
sensual community is feeling com
fortable about where you live. So,
every quarter we have "rooming
meeting," during which people can
rethink (or not rethink; two guys
have lived in the same double all
three quarters) their living situa
tion. One of the options for living is
a commune, in which a five-plus
group of people can elect to have
two rooms, one of which is used for
sleeping and the other for socializ
ing/studying.

Although some people find this
system scary, it's actually quite
flexible and convenient. Because of
the social room, you never have to
work quietly in deference to your
roommates. In addition, having a
space that's dedicated entirely to
socializing (i.e. no bulky beds lying
around) allows for more creativity
with the setup: Every quarter, I've
had a projector and two couches in
my room. Because of the fluid
roommate situation, residents end
up meeting and bonding with more
people in the house, which makes
for a much more cohesive commu
nity. I myself have roomed with
nine separate people during my
time here, quite happily.
"Why would I cook and clean for
myself?"
Well, you're going to be doing
exactly that after you graduate, so
why not start learning now? I have
learned a number of healthy easy
recipes at Synergy that I know will
save me from going out for food lat
er in life. And because everyone is
cooking for themselves here, the
food is usually really good.
Why would you clean for your
self? Try not to roll your eyes when
I say that cleaning jobs have been
some of the most fun times
I've had here. You and three
friends put on loud music
and enjoy a relaxed and so
cial study-break. When do
you get something like that
in Crothers?
"The one time I've been to
Synergy, I saw my fresh
man RA's d*ck."
Nudity seems to be the
most misunderstood and
widely feared aspect about
the house (it's probably uni
versally misunderstood too,
but I'll save that can of
worms for a later article).
First of all, about 90 percent
of the house is just as nude as
you and I are right now (i.e.
completely clothed), except

perhaps during the few co-op
events that specifically en
courage nudity like the quar
terly "body painting" event at
Columbae or Synergy's
Beltane festival in the spring.
In other words, the chances
of visiting the house and com
ing across a naked person are
very low.
People seem to believe
that the remaining 10 percent
of residents are constantly
nude when they're at the
house. This is also not true.
The more-inclined-to-nudity
folks of Synergy are just as
hairless as anyone else, and
thus they get cold when the
temperature drops. They do,
in fact, own clothes, which
they put on when they feel
cold. The only time nudity
happens on any sort of ob
servable scale is when it's so
hot that the rest of the cam
pus is in bathing suits anyway.
Now, let's say the planets

align and you see a naked
person at Synergy. Can we
all just be adults for a sec
ond? It's not that big a deal;
it's not even a"way of life";
it's just a convenience thing;
that person is probably just
going to grab their laundry,
and wanted to wash the
clothes they had on as well
(I've certainly done that).
You know that part of Bruno
Mars' "The Lazy Song"
where he says "I'll just strut
in my birthday suit and let
everything hang loose, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"?
Synergy nudity is just as
low-key.

In conclusion, let me as
sure you that I was no born
Synergen. I have become an
advocate by choice. A year
ago during draw season, I
was not so different from you.
My roommate and I were

drawing in tier 2 and had
Branner and Toyon at the top
of our list. A couple nights be
fore the housing deadline, I
had a talk with my PHE that
convinced me to rank some
tier 1 coops at the top of our
list (I didn't tell my room
mate I'd changed our order
because what were the
chances we'd get a tier 1
house with tier 21). I had nev
er even been to Synergy
when I got the news that I
was going to live here, but it
has been one of the greatest
adventures of my life. Even
my roommate, who was ini
tially sullen because our low
draw number would have
gotten us a two-room double
in Branner, claims that this
was one of the best "deci
sions" of his Stanford career
so far, and plans to live here
again with his tier 1 draw.
I hope this article illumi
nates some of the sweetest
secrets about the Stanford
co-op community (because,
honestly, there are a few resi
dents who would prefer that
the secret not get out). And if
you don't believe me, consid
er this article a ticket to come
eat dinner at the house
just email me.

Indeed, if you don't believe
Limn Kinney when he waxes
poetic on Synergy, he's hap
py to continue with you.

Why would you clean for your
self? Try not to roll your eyes when
I say that cleaning jobs have been
some of the most fun times
I've had here. You and three
friends put on loud music
and enjoy a relaxed and so
cial study-break. When do
you get something like that
in Crothers?
"The one time I've been to
Synergy, I saw my fresh
man RA's d*ck."
Nudity seems to be the
most misunderstood and
widely feared aspect about
the house (it's probably uni
versally misunderstood too,
but I'll save that can of
worms for a later article).
First of all, about 90 percent
of the house is just as nude as
you and I are right now (i.e.
completely clothed), except

perhaps during the few co-op
events that specifically en
courage nudity like the quar
terly "body painting" event at
Columbae or Synergy's
Beltane festival in the spring.
In other words, the chances
of visiting the house and com
ing across a naked person are
very low.
People seem to believe
that the remaining 10 percent
of residents are constantly
nude when they're at the
house. This is also not true.
The more-inclined-to-nudity
folks of Synergy are just as
hairless as anyone else, and
thus they get cold when the
temperature drops. They do,
in fact, own clothes, which
they put on when they feel
cold. The only time nudity
happens on any sort of ob
servable scale is when it's so
hot that the rest of the cam
pus is in bathing suits anyway.
Now, let's say the planets

align and you see a naked
person at Synergy. Can we
all just be adults for a sec
ond? It's not that big a deal;
it's not even a"way of life";
it's just a convenience thing;
that person is probably just
going to grab their laundry,
and wanted to wash the
clothes they had on as well
(I've certainly done that).
You know that part of Bruno
Mars' "The Lazy Song"
where he says "I'll just strut
in my birthday suit and let
everything hang loose, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"?
Synergy nudity is just as
low-key.

In conclusion, let me as
sure you that I was no born
Synergen. I have become an
advocate by choice. A year
ago during draw season, I
was not so different from you.
My roommate and I were

drawing in tier 2 and had
Branner and Toyon at the top
of our list. A couple nights be
fore the housing deadline, I
had a talk with my PHE that
convinced me to rank some
tier 1 coops at the top of our
list (I didn't tell my room
mate I'd changed our order
because what were the
chances we'd get a tier 1
house with tier 21). I had nev
er even been to Synergy
when I got the news that I
was going to live here, but it
has been one of the greatest
adventures of my life. Even
my roommate, who was ini
tially sullen because our low
draw number would have
gotten us a two-room double
in Branner, claims that this
was one of the best "deci
sions" of his Stanford career
so far, and plans to live here
again with his tier 1 draw.
I hope this article illumi
nates some of the sweetest
secrets about the Stanford
co-op community (because,
honestly, there are a few resi
dents who would prefer that
the secret not get out). And if
you don't believe me, consid
er this article a ticket to come
eat dinner at the house
just email me.

Indeed, if you don't believe
Limn Kinney when he waxes
poetic on Synergy, he's hap
py to continue with you.

The other day I was at a small
get-together in a friend's
apartment, catching up with
friends in my major over EANABs
and Easter chocolates. At some
point, someone asked, "How was
your weekend?" and I commented
how much fun the Synergy beach
trip had been last weekend. The
person I was talking with scoffed
and laughed. Before I knew it, the
room morphed into a kind of re
verse intervention: as people in
turn stated their reasons for fear
ing association with Synergy, I
sought to explain how they were
misguided or overly dismissive.
This instance was not the first time
I'd heard these complaints, and it
won't be the last. Hopefully, in hon
or of the draw season, I can nip
some such misconceptions in the
bud with my next two articles:
"Ughh, that hill"
Synergy is exactly 53 feet above
Campus Drive. If you've ever
climbed to the garden-roof of Her
rin Hall, it's easier than that. The
isolation, by the way, is what makes
it such a nice and quiet living space.
"Synergy is crazy"
Unless you have friends in Syn
ergy, the only reason you would
ever make that Everestian trek is

for the infamous Halloween party.
On that night, whatever may hap
pen, the opinion (lore? rumor?) of
Synergy is shaped in the minds of
the freshmen (who become the
sophomores, and the seniors, etc.).
Synergy is that nocturnal Addams
Family mansion on the hill, rapt in
perpetual bass, where someone saw
someone forcing a mixed drink on a
supine freshman like Harry on
Dumbledore in the beginning of the
Half Blood Prince. Yeah ... no.
Synergy is one of the most
serene houses on campus. It is the
only "Row" house completely sur
rounded by trees to the point
that we can't hear the cars on Cam
pus Drive or Mayfield Row. The
house's strict quiet hours (11-9 on
weeknights, 1-11 on weekends, en
forced every night but Halloween)
quash any attempts at fratting. As
I write this article, I am sitting on
one of our three sunny porches, lis
tening to the birds as my roommate
plays one-on-one soccer on our
lawn.
In fact, many Synergy residents
dislike our Halloween party. On
that night, there are people run
ning up and down the halls, de
stroying the bathrooms and floors
(which the residents clean, not
ResEd, remember?), and the resi
dents have no control over when

they can go to sleep. It's downright
exhausting.
"Aren't there animals there?"
Not, like, jaguars and tarantu
las. Synergy has six friendly chick
ens. A couple of our house jobs
(some of the most desirable ones, in
fact) are dedicated to taking care of
the chickens and it's actually pretty
relaxing to grab some feed and go
talk with them for a bit. Our ani
mals are the reason people visit, not
the reason they stay away.
"Aren't there, like, seven people
to a room?"
People find this notion terrify
ing, but a lot of people, including
me, love it. The communes, as
they're called, are the pride of both
Synergy and Columbae.
Part of the intentional and con
sensual community is feeling com
fortable about where you live. So,
every quarter we have "rooming
meeting," during which people can
rethink (or not rethink; two guys
have lived in the same double all
three quarters) their living situa
tion. One of the options for living is
a commune, in which a five-plus
group of people can elect to have
two rooms, one of which is used for
sleeping and the other for socializ
ing/studying.

Although some people find this
system scary, it's actually quite
flexible and convenient. Because of
the social room, you never have to
work quietly in deference to your
roommates. In addition, having a
space that's dedicated entirely to
socializing (i.e. no bulky beds lying
around) allows for more creativity
with the setup: Every quarter, I've
had a projector and two couches in
my room. Because of the fluid
roommate situation, residents end
up meeting and bonding with more
people in the house, which makes
for a much more cohesive commu
nity. I myself have roomed with
nine separate people during my
time here, quite happily.
"Why would I cook and clean for
myself?"
Well, you're going to be doing
exactly that after you graduate, so
why not start learning now? I have
learned a number of healthy easy
recipes at Synergy that I know will
save me from going out for food lat
er in life. And because everyone is
cooking for themselves here, the
food is usually really good.
Why would you clean for your
self? Try not to roll your eyes when
I say that cleaning jobs have been
some of the most fun times
I've had here. You and three
friends put on loud music

bud with my next two articles:
"Ughh, that hill"
Synergy is exactly 53 feet above
Campus Drive. If you've ever
climbed to the garden-roof of Her
rin Hall, it's easier than that. The
isolation, by the way, is what makes
it such a nice and quiet living space.
"Synergy is crazy"
Unless you have friends in Syn
ergy, the only reason you would
ever make that Everestian trek is

for the infamous Halloween party.
On that night, whatever may hap
pen, the opinion (lore? rumor?) of
Synergy is shaped in the minds of
the freshmen (who become the
sophomores, and the seniors, etc.).
Synergy is that nocturnal Addams
Family mansion on the hill, rapt in
perpetual bass, where someone saw
someone forcing a mixed drink on a
supine freshman like Harry on
Dumbledore in the beginning of the
Half Blood Prince. Yeah ... no.
Synergy is one of the most
serene houses on campus. It is the
only "Row" house completely sur
rounded by trees to the point
that we can't hear the cars on Cam
pus Drive or Mayfield Row. The
house's strict quiet hours (11-9 on
weeknights, 1-11 on weekends, en
forced every night but Halloween)
quash any attempts at fratting. As
I write this article, I am sitting on
one of our three sunny porches, lis
tening to the birds as my roommate
plays one-on-one soccer on our
lawn.
In fact, many Synergy residents
dislike our Halloween party. On
that night, there are people run
ning up and down the halls, de
stroying the bathrooms and floors
(which the residents clean, not
ResEd, remember?), and the resi
dents have no control over when

they can go to sleep. It's downright
exhausting.
"Aren't there animals there?"
Not, like, jaguars and tarantu
las. Synergy has six friendly chick
ens. A couple of our house jobs
(some of the most desirable ones, in
fact) are dedicated to taking care of
the chickens and it's actually pretty
relaxing to grab some feed and go
talk with them for a bit. Our ani
mals are the reason people visit, not
the reason they stay away.
"Aren't there, like, seven people
to a room?"
People find this notion terrify
ing, but a lot of people, including
me, love it. The communes, as
they're called, are the pride of both
Synergy and Columbae.
Part of the intentional and con
sensual community is feeling com
fortable about where you live. So,
every quarter we have "rooming
meeting," during which people can
rethink (or not rethink; two guys
have lived in the same double all
three quarters) their living situa
tion. One of the options for living is
a commune, in which a five-plus
group of people can elect to have
two rooms, one of which is used for
sleeping and the other for socializ
ing/studying.

Although some people find this
system scary, it's actually quite
flexible and convenient. Because of
the social room, you never have to
work quietly in deference to your
roommates. In addition, having a
space that's dedicated entirely to
socializing (i.e. no bulky beds lying
around) allows for more creativity
with the setup: Every quarter, I've
had a projector and two couches in
my room. Because of the fluid
roommate situation, residents end
up meeting and bonding with more
people in the house, which makes
for a much more cohesive commu
nity. I myself have roomed with
nine separate people during my
time here, quite happily.
"Why would I cook and clean for
myself?"
Well, you're going to be doing
exactly that after you graduate, so
why not start learning now? I have
learned a number of healthy easy
recipes at Synergy that I know will
save me from going out for food lat
er in life. And because everyone is
cooking for themselves here, the
food is usually really good.
Why would you clean for your
self? Try not to roll your eyes when
I say that cleaning jobs have been
some of the most fun times
I've had here. You and three
friends put on loud music
and enjoy a relaxed and so
cial study-break. When do
you get something like that
in Crothers?
"The one time I've been to
Synergy, I saw my fresh
man RA's d*ck."
Nudity seems to be the
most misunderstood and
widely feared aspect about
the house (it's probably uni
versally misunderstood too,
but I'll save that can of
worms for a later article).
First of all, about 90 percent
of the house is just as nude as
you and I are right now (i.e.
completely clothed), except

perhaps during the few co-op
events that specifically en
courage nudity like the quar
terly "body painting" event at
Columbae or Synergy's
Beltane festival in the spring.
In other words, the chances
of visiting the house and com
ing across a naked person are
very low.
People seem to believe
that the remaining 10 percent
of residents are constantly
nude when they're at the
house. This is also not true.
The more-inclined-to-nudity
folks of Synergy are just as
hairless as anyone else, and
thus they get cold when the
temperature drops. They do,
in fact, own clothes, which
they put on when they feel
cold. The only time nudity
happens on any sort of ob
servable scale is when it's so
hot that the rest of the cam
pus is in bathing suits anyway.
Now, let's say the planets

align and you see a naked
person at Synergy. Can we
all just be adults for a sec
ond? It's not that big a deal;
it's not even a"way of life";
it's just a convenience thing;
that person is probably just
going to grab their laundry,
and wanted to wash the
clothes they had on as well
(I've certainly done that).
You know that part of Bruno
Mars' "The Lazy Song"
where he says "I'll just strut
in my birthday suit and let
everything hang loose, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"?
Synergy nudity is just as
low-key.

In conclusion, let me as
sure you that I was no born
Synergen. I have become an
advocate by choice. A year
ago during draw season, I
was not so different from you.
My roommate and I were

drawing in tier 2 and had
Branner and Toyon at the top
of our list. A couple nights be
fore the housing deadline, I
had a talk with my PHE that
convinced me to rank some
tier 1 coops at the top of our
list (I didn't tell my room
mate I'd changed our order
because what were the
chances we'd get a tier 1
house with tier 21). I had nev
er even been to Synergy
when I got the news that I
was going to live here, but it
has been one of the greatest
adventures of my life. Even
my roommate, who was ini
tially sullen because our low
draw number would have
gotten us a two-room double
in Branner, claims that this
was one of the best "deci
sions" of his Stanford career
so far, and plans to live here
again with his tier 1 draw.
I hope this article illumi
nates some of the sweetest
secrets about the Stanford
co-op community (because,
honestly, there are a few resi
dents who would prefer that
the secret not get out). And if
you don't believe me, consid
er this article a ticket to come
eat dinner at the house
just email me.

Indeed, if you don't believe
Limn Kinney when he waxes
poetic on Synergy, he's hap
py to continue with you.
