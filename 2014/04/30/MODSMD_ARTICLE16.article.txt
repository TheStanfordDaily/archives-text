## In defense of Donald Sterling 
### Vihan Lakshman 
Donald Sterling, you brilliant,
brilliant man. For a second
there, I thought you were
about to do something so egregious,
so utterly insane in this day and age,
so against your core values that your
entire empire would crumble: field a
winning basketball team.
For years, you have been a true
visionary in the NBA assembling
aggressively incompetent squads on
cheap contracts year after year, al
lowing you to turn one of the highest
profit margins in the league. I mean,
what's the point of owning a profes
sional sports franchise if you can't
make the most bang for your buck?
That would be as crazy as saying you
plan to build a medical complex to
help the homeless and then actually
going through with it. Who does that?
Which brings me back to my main
point: your brilliance. Clearly, you no
ticed that your Clippers were simply
better than the Golden State War
riors and sought to fix that issue.
Your poetic, insightful commentary
on the dangers of associating with
black people set your team com
posed predominately of African
Americans into a state of confu
sion over whether to boycott the next

game or continue to play in your
name. While your plan didn't com
pletely work as the Clips suited up
for Game 4, the dynamic of the team
had completely changed and the
Golden State Warriors breathed
new life en route to a lopsided victo
ry.

You have played your part beau
tifully. The Clippers looked distract
ed and out of rhythm on Sunday. I
was wondering how you were going
to remedy this curse of good basket
ball after that filthy Communist
David Stern ripped Chris Paul from
the clutches of the Los Angeles Lak
ers and gave him to you instead.
Furthermore, you somehow ended
up with an excellent coach in Doc
Rivers manning your bench. After
recycling coaches throughout your
entire squad at a rate that probably
earned you membership into the
Sierra Club, you somehow ended up

with an unprecedented degree of sta
bility and dare I say it a cham
pionship-caliber team.
But all that changed with one,
strategically-timed, "secretly record
ed" phone conversation with your
girlfriend. You have done all basket
ball fans a considerable favor be
cause, at the end of the day, the NBA
is just so much better when the Clip
pers flat-out suck. So many basket
ball fans, like myself, yearn for the
good ol' days when we had some
where to avert our eyes from the
sickening degree of world-class bas
ketball around us (though, to be fair,
watching DeAndre Jordan shoot free
throws comes pretty close).
I'm glad you value the glories of
the past, Mr. Sterling. From making
sure the Clippers return to their
rightful place at the bottom of the
league to reportedly ordering your
old General Manager to assemble a
plantation-style team with all black
players and a white head coach, your
clearly get it. Tradition is important
and I applaud you for stepping up to
preserve the Clippers' greatest tra
dition: to try to make sure one of the
best rosters in the NBA never comes
close to a championship.
And that's why I was so disap
pointed when new NBA commission
er Adam Silver the Stalin to
Stern's Lenin announced that you
have been banned for life and will be
urged to sell your team. What is he
thinking? The NBA needs the Clip
pers to continue being the Clippers.
Who else is going to play their hearts
out and lose, taking away high draft
picks from teams trying to tank? I,
for one, am sad to see you go based
on highly circumstantial evidence
that just happens to fit a well-estab
lished pattern of behavior. The nerve
of some people.
I wish you all the best, Mr. Ster
ling, in your future endeavors and
hope that others come to respect you
for the courageous move you made. I
also wish, on your behalf, the Clip
pers bad luck as they find themselves
tied with the Golden State Warriors
at two games apiece in a series they
could very well win. Here's hoping
that your comments are still a locker
room distraction and throw Chris
Paul, Blake Griffin and company off
rhythm. Your comments are a re
minder to all of us that racism still
reai-s its head in America, but I hope
people see that your bigotry is on an
other level fueling your ultimate
goal of terrible basketball. I applaud
you, Donald Sterling, for taking a
stand that no one else was willing to
take. You set a very powerful exam
ple for us all.

Donald Sterling, you brilliant,
brilliant man. For a second
there, I thought you were
about to do something so egregious,
so utterly insane in this day and age,
so against your core values that your
entire empire would crumble: field a
winning basketball team.
For years, you have been a true
visionary in the NBA assembling
aggressively incompetent squads on
cheap contracts year after year, al
lowing you to turn one of the highest
profit margins in the league. I mean,
what's the point of owning a profes
sional sports franchise if you can't
make the most bang for your buck?
That would be as crazy as saying you
plan to build a medical complex to
help the homeless and then actually
going through with it. Who does that?
Which brings me back to my main
point: your brilliance. Clearly, you no
ticed that your Clippers were simply
better than the Golden State War
riors and sought to fix that issue.
Your poetic, insightful commentary
on the dangers of associating with
black people set your team com
posed predominately of African
Americans into a state of confu
sion over whether to boycott the next

game or continue to play in your
name. While your plan didn't com
pletely work as the Clips suited up
for Game 4, the dynamic of the team
had completely changed and the
Golden State Warriors breathed
new life en route to a lopsided victo
ry.

You have played your part beau
tifully. The Clippers looked distract
ed and out of rhythm on Sunday. I
was wondering how you were going
to remedy this curse of good basket
ball after that filthy Communist
David Stern ripped Chris Paul from
the clutches of the Los Angeles Lak
ers and gave him to you instead.
Furthermore, you somehow ended
up with an excellent coach in Doc
Rivers manning your bench. After
recycling coaches throughout your
entire squad at a rate that probably
earned you membership into the
Sierra Club, you somehow ended up

with an unprecedented degree of sta
bility and dare I say it a cham
pionship-caliber team.
But all that changed with one,
strategically-timed, "secretly record
ed" phone conversation with your
girlfriend. You have done all basket
ball fans a considerable favor be
cause, at the end of the day, the NBA
is just so much better when the Clip
pers flat-out suck. So many basket
ball fans, like myself, yearn for the
good ol' days when we had some
where to avert our eyes from the
sickening degree of world-class bas
ketball around us (though, to be fair,
watching DeAndre Jordan shoot free
throws comes pretty close).
I'm glad you value the glories of
the past, Mr. Sterling. From making
sure the Clippers return to their
rightful place at the bottom of the
league to reportedly ordering your
old General Manager to assemble a
plantation-style team with all black
players and a white head coach, your
clearly get it. Tradition is important
and I applaud you for stepping up to
preserve the Clippers' greatest tra
dition: to try to make sure one of the
best rosters in the NBA never comes
close to a championship.
And that's why I was so disap
pointed when new NBA commission
er Adam Silver the Stalin to
Stern's Lenin announced that you
have been banned for life and will be
urged to sell your team. What is he
thinking? The NBA needs the Clip
pers to continue being the Clippers.
Who else is going to play their hearts
out and lose, taking away high draft
picks from teams trying to tank? I,
for one, am sad to see you go based
on highly circumstantial evidence
that just happens to fit a well-estab
lished pattern of behavior. The nerve
of some people.
I wish you all the best, Mr. Ster
ling, in your future endeavors and
hope that others come to respect you
for the courageous move you made. I
also wish, on your behalf, the Clip
pers bad luck as they find themselves
