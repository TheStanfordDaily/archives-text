## Examination of word choice and eloquence reveals Yelp review trends 
### IRENE HSU DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
"Sinful," "voluptuous" and
"sexy" are all words used to de
scribe the food at expensive
restaurants while "addicting,"
"crack" and "drug" are used to de
scribe the food at cheaper restau
rants, according to a paper pub
lished by Professor of Linguistics
Dan Jurafsky and several other
professors from Carnegie Mellon
University.
The research team discovered
similar trends throughout 900,000
Yelp reviews given to 6,584 differ
ent restaurants. For example, in
descriptions of good food, they dis
covered that sexual words were
used in reviews of expensive
restaurants, whereas drug-related
words were used in reviews of
cheap restaurants.
Rich desserts including choco
late cake and truffles were associ
ated with sensuality and often de
scribed with words such as "dark"
and "romantic." Foods like burg
ers, chicken wings and chocolate

were often described with

drug metaphors. Veg
etables and fish were
generally not described
with such language,
which was reserved for
foods that seemed to be '
a "violation of cuisine
norms."
"The folk model of
what we crave or are
addicted to encompass- ,

es foods that are
somehow considered
inappropriate for a

meal," the study stated,
specifically singling .

out "comfort food that <
we feel guilty for having

but eat anyhow."

Beyond word choice, the
researchers found that re
viewers of more expensive
restaurants were more elo-

quent and expansive in
their reviews.
"[This] suggests that

reviewers are adopting the stance
of the high socio-economic class
associated with expensive restau-

rants," the study stat
ed. "The use of this

higher level of edu
cational capital is
thus another way
that the review of
fers a chance for
self-depiction, in
this case away for
the reviewer to por
tray themselves as
well educated."

The researchers

also found that more
s critical reviews
those that assigned

one star to a restau
rant— employed lan
guage related to trau-

matic experiences more of
ten.

When asked to describe
events like the death of

K Princess Diana, a fire on

campus or 9/11, people
use words like "tragic"
and "terrible," in addi-

tion to the collective pronoun "we,"
in their writings, according to re
search by UT-Austin Professor of

Psychology James Pennebaker. In
cidentally, similar words and styles
were found in negative restaurant
reviews on Yelp while positive re
views used first-person singular
pronouns.
"People talk a lot in 'we' and
'us,' as though to appeal to the col
lective to get through the trauma,"
Jurafsky said.
He also emphasized reviewers'
tendency to rate more than just a
restaurant's food. After looking at
his own Yelp reviews, he discov
ered that even he had subcon
sciously written negative reviews
based on service.
"I expected people to only com
ment on the food, but when people
write one-star reviews, it's always
because there is a face threat," Ju
rafsky said.
In the past, Jurafsky has
worked on various other projects
in computational linguistics and ex
plored how language and food in
tersect. He also teaches an intro
ductory seminar at Stanford

Josh Freedman 'll took
Jurafsky's class in 2008
and completed a final proj
ect on potato chip advertis
ing that turned into a full

research paper with Juraf
sky's help.
"[Jurafsky] has an ex
tensive range of linguistics
experience, from historical
to analytical," Freedman
said. "The paper had a lot of
shortcomings when I
turned it in my freshman
year, but with his help, I put
that into a real study. He
helped me look at the

broader picture, which is
why the paper was any good
at all."
Jurafsky is currently
working on another re
search project about the
language used in menus of
different types of restau
rants.

their reviews.
"[This] suggests that

reviewers are adopting the stance
of the high socio-economic class
associated with expensive restau-

rants," the study stat
ed. "The use of this

higher level of edu
cational capital is
thus another way
that the review of
fers a chance for
self-depiction, in
this case away for
the reviewer to por
tray themselves as
well educated."

The researchers

also found that more
s critical reviews
those that assigned

one star to a restau
rant— employed lan
guage related to trau-

matic experiences more of
ten.

When asked to describe
events like the death of

K Princess Diana, a fire on

campus or 9/11, people
use words like "tragic"
and "terrible," in addi-

tion to the collective pronoun "we,"
in their writings, according to re
search by UT-Austin Professor of

Psychology James Pennebaker. In
cidentally, similar words and styles
were found in negative restaurant
reviews on Yelp while positive re
views used first-person singular
pronouns.
"People talk a lot in 'we' and
'us,' as though to appeal to the col
lective to get through the trauma,"
Jurafsky said.
He also emphasized reviewers'
tendency to rate more than just a
restaurant's food. After looking at
his own Yelp reviews, he discov
ered that even he had subcon
sciously written negative reviews
based on service.
"I expected people to only com
ment on the food, but when people
write one-star reviews, it's always
because there is a face threat," Ju
rafsky said.
In the past, Jurafsky has
worked on various other projects
in computational linguistics and ex
plored how language and food in
tersect. He also teaches an intro
ductory seminar at Stanford


GEORGE MA/
The Stanford Daily
called "Language of Food."
Josh Freedman 'll took
Jurafsky's class in 2008
and completed a final proj
ect on potato chip advertis
ing that turned into a full

research paper with Juraf
sky's help.
"[Jurafsky] has an ex
tensive range of linguistics
experience, from historical
to analytical," Freedman
said. "The paper had a lot of
shortcomings when I
turned it in my freshman
year, but with his help, I put
that into a real study. He
helped me look at the

broader picture, which is
why the paper was any good
at all."
Jurafsky is currently
working on another re
search project about the
language used in menus of
different types of restau
rants.
