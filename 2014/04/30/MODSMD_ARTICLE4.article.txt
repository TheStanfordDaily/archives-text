## Senate turns over, swears in new Execs 15th Senate's final meeting focuses on funding measures 
### PETER MOON DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
The final meeting of the 15th ASSU
Undergraduate Senate began with the
swearing-in of recently elected ASSU
Executives Elizabeth Woodson 'l5 and
Logan Richard 'l5 on Tuesday
evening. Woodson and Richard were
sworn in by Administration and Rules
Committee Chair John-Lancaster Fin
ley 'l6, who will also serve in the 16th
Senate.
The Senate subsequently continued
last week's discussion of an emergency
measure, authored by Senate Chair
Ben Holston 'l5, that would give the
Senate the resources to fund general
fees groups through the remainder of
spring quarter. The measure proposed
combining reserves from the Senate
Innovation Fund and the Senate
Chair's discretionary account to help
make up the emergent shortfall.
In the ensuing discussion, student
leaders sought to emphasize the Sen
ate's ethical responsibility to fund stu
dent groups and not rescind previous
ly allocated funding in open discussion.
