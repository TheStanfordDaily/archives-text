## Senate turns over, swears in new Execs 15th Senate's final meeting focuses on funding measures 
### PETER MOON DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
The final meeting of the 15th ASSU
Undergraduate Senate began with the
swearing-in of recently elected ASSU
Executives Elizabeth Woodson 'l5 and
Logan Richard 'l5 on Tuesday
evening. Woodson and Richard were
sworn in by Administration and Rules
Committee Chair John-Lancaster Fin
ley 'l6, who will also serve in the 16th
Senate.
The Senate subsequently continued
last week's discussion of an emergency
measure, authored by Senate Chair
Ben Holston 'l5, that would give the
Senate the resources to fund general
fees groups through the remainder of
spring quarter. The measure proposed
combining reserves from the Senate
Innovation Fund and the Senate
Chair's discretionary account to help
make up the emergent shortfall.
In the ensuing discussion, student
leaders sought to emphasize the Sen
ate's ethical responsibility to fund stu
dent groups and not rescind previous
ly allocated funding in open discussion.
The bill eventually passed,
while the Senate follow
ing the recommendation of
Stanford Student Enterpris
es also took back
$74,642.64 of unspent money
from general fees groups.
Members of the 16th Sen
ate emphasized their intent,
however, to reexamine which
student organizations will
receive their money back
and ask student groups
which line-item funds they
are willing to give back to

the Senate.
The Senate also dis
cussed the Bill to Allocate
Funds for Overhead Projec
tor System in GCC's Havana
Room. Introduced by
Deputy Chair Anna Breed
'l6, the bill effectively allows
the Graduate Student Coun
cil (GSC) to use $lO,OOO from
their own buffer fund to in
stall a projector system.
"A lot of students have
approached and said there
should be a projector sys
tem," Breed said. "They also
approached housing and
housing said they would be
willing to pay half, which is
$10,000."
The 15th Senate passed

the measure, as well as bills
confirming Justine Moore
'l6 and Olivia Moore 'l6 as
ASSU Assistant Financial
Managers, confirming stu
dent representatives to vari
ous University committees
and confirming the results
of this year's ASSU elec
tions.
As the meeting neared
an end, many of the veteran
ASSU members, including
ASSU Assistant Financial
Manager Stephen Trusheim
'l3 M.S. 'l4, who has been
involved with the ASSU for
five years, spoke about the
many obstacles overcome
by this year's Senate and
how excited they were to

see new leaders assume
roles for the 2014-15 aca
demic year.
After the meeting con
cluded, Richard swore in the
16th Undergraduate Senate.
The 16th Senate went on to
assign senators to the Sen
ate's various committees,
while Holston and Finley
were reelected to their re
spective roles as chair and
parliamentarian. Victoria
Kalumbi 'l5, Jackson Beard
'l7 and Eric Theis 'l6 were
elected as deputy chair, ap
propriations committee chair
and treasurer respectively.
