### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
Three University facilities
Arrillaga Family Sports Center,
Taube Family Tennis Stadium and
Taube South Tennis Courts
were evacuated Tuesday morning
in response to a gas leak in the
vicinity. The area was reopened
late Tuesday evening after repairs
were completed.
The gas leak was initially re
ported at approximately 10:10 a.m.
in the area of 641 Campus Drive,
near the Arrillaga Family Sports
Center. A backhoe working on a
Department of Athletics, Physical
Education and Recreation paving
project there had broken a six-inch
pipe.
According to University spokes
woman Lisa Lapin, the campus po
lice and fire departments were sub
sequently called to the scene and
the three affected buildings evacu
ated and closed out of caution.
Two-way car and pedestrian traffic
on Campus Drive between Galvez
Street and Bonair Siding was
blocked as representatives from
Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E)
worked to shut down and replace
the broken pipe.

"We're working together with
PG&E to make repairs, test the
line and make sure there is no gas
build-up in buildings, that every
thing is clear," Lapin said Tuesday
afternoon.

While no athletic events were
disrupted, IT Services reported
that some users may have experi
enced issues with limited internet
access and VoIP telephone service
interruptions as a result of the inci
dent.

Repairs were estimated to not
be complete until 9 p.m. at the ear
liest. Ultimately, the gas leak was
repaired by 9:07 p.m. and the area
reopened to vehicle and pedestrian
traffic shortly after.
