# PUSHING BACK
## A 						BOUNCE-BACK SEASON FOR STANFORD RUGBY 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
For a program that has been playing
continuously on Stanford's campus
since 1906, Stanford rugby has been
relegated to a very understated
niche on campus since its loss of
varsity status in 1977. Although its history is
rife with significant names like that of stand

out quarterback Don Bunce, runs to the rug
by Final Four and other unforgettable mo
ments, the reality of being a club sport on a
campus full of successful NCAA Division I
programs has meant that its successes and
failures in recent history have all gone rela
tively unnoticed.

But over the last weekend, the USA Rug
by National Championship series was set to
take place at Stanford for the Sweet 16 and
Elite Eight matchups of the Western Re-

gional, and both the
men's and women's
teams stood in a
unique position this

season. For the first time in recent memory,
the two teams simultaneously stood as con
ference champions while hosting both nation
al championships, giving each squad the op
portunity to make deep playoff runs on its

home facility.
Although the teams have
seen their fair share of ups
and downs with the men
having suffered a deep rut
over the last several seasons
and the women having en
dured the pain of several
playoff runs coming to un
timely ends this season
has seemed to mark the be
ginning of a significant up
swing for both programs.
The men are set to establish
a precedent of success and
leadership which they will
look to carry them forward
in the next few years. The
women, meanwhile, are
primed to rally behind an in
domitable spirit of unity and
one of the deepest rosters in
memory to finally overcome
the hump and return to the
top of the women's rugby
world.

"While we were losing last
year, it was kind of funny be
cause you would see how the
other club sports were doing,
and I think we were by far
the worst club sport in terms
of win-loss," said senior cap
tain Dan Agness of the men's
team. "Everyone at this
school is so used to killing it;
it's understandable that guys
would want to quit after
something like that. Every
body here is used to being
awesome and exemplary, and
then to come in and join a
team that's anything but ex
emplary it's hard."
The lack of a focused pro
gram on the men's side has
hurt its ability to stay com
petitive over the last two
seasons, with players freer
to give the team as much or
as little commitment as they
wanted without fear of
harsh consequences. The
team also suffered from an
unavoidable amount of inex
perience with rugby that
warranted a greater focus
on individual and team fun
damentals rather than on
overarching strategy during
practices.
And it was more than
that; as a club sport on cam
pus, there wasn't any great
incentive for team members
to sacrifice other elements
of their Stanford experience

and education to spend their
time on a team that would
get blown out by margins of
60 points week after week.
"We absolutely recognize
that we're a club sport," Ag
ness said. "Sometimes, peo
ple will grumble when
Coach makes a morning ses
sion that we thought would
be pretty quick into some
thing intensive."
After the conclusion of a
winless conference season in
2013, it was clear that a
change needed to happen in
order to get the team out of
its rut and build the pro
gram back into prominence.
And although there were
misgivings at times, the de
cision was made to drop the
program from Division I-A
to Division I-AA in order to
give the team an opportuni
ty to re-establish a winning
culture rather than having
losing be the status quo
week after week.
Thus, with higher expec
tations of on-field success for
the team in 2014 at a new
level of competition, the fo
cus of the program shifted to
developing that new culture
and making it a sustainable
team spirit both this season
and for the coming seasons.
Building that new paradigm
began with the upperclass
man leadership Agness
among them that had
stuck with the program
through the trying seasons
and was thus ready to lead
the team in a new direction.

"I think we were a young
team very few upper
classmen [in the past]," said
head coach Matt Sherman.
"I think we struggled to get
the culture right on and off
the field, but the senior play
ers and leadership [this sea
son] have done a fantastic
job of motivating the whole
team, and I think the whole
team has done a great job of
responding and building a
really strong team culture
that wants to work hard for
each other, and the result has
been fantastic."
"When I got here as a
freshman, we didn't have a
coach; we were in the hiring
process and got Coach Sher
man," Agness said. "The be

lief that he's putting us on
the right track and even af
ter last year a really bru
tal season we kind of all
knew that it wasn't perma
nent. With the right recon
struction, the right coaching
and continuing to get the
right guys out here, we
weren't going to stay in the
basement."
After a meeting among
the team's leadership at the
beginning of the season to
establish that push in the
new direction, a strong non
conference showing to open
the season gave the mem
bers of the team the spark
needed to become more fo
cused, more united and more
involved in the effort to push
the program back into rele
vance.
Even through the strug
gles of seasons past, the is
sue has never been that the
team was putting the wrong
people on the field or that it
was performing at a lower
level than its competition.
Those might have been con
tributing factors, sure, but
the main issue was that the
team had lost its confidence,
its drive and its identity.
This season, ignited by its
new leadership, as well as
the contributions of the re
turning team members and a
talented freshman class, the
team got off to a faster start
with a hard-fought win over
the University of San Diego
and narrow losses to tough
non-conference matchups in
Santa Clara and Oregon
State that served to remind
them that they were able to
compete with those con
tenders. After that, the team
blew out San Francisco State
and San Diego State to kick
off the heart of conference
play, and the ball was rolling.
"You get like that little
boost of confidence in the be
ginning, then you remember,
'Oh, yeah, we could be pretty
good,"' Agness said. "Be
cause we've got good athletes
out here who probably played
below their athletic ability
last season and got in a rut.
Once you get that little boost
to get out, we started to put it
together and confidence was
exponential in a lot of ways."

The rest, as they say, is his
tory.
The team caught a groove
and went undefeated through
both the conference season
and the tournament with a
trip to Barbados in the mid
dle to boot. Victories over San
Jose State and Chico State in
the conference tournament
gave the team a champi
onship trophy, but more im
portantly, it gave the mem
bers of the team both old
and new something tangi
ble to hold on to, something to
justify all of the time and ef
fort that they put into the
sport through all of the trials
and tribulations of seasons
past.
And with the national
tournament approaching, the

season gave the team success
and momentum to build on as
it hoped to extend its worst
to-first story to the national
stage. After the success of the
season, players bought into
the collective efforts more
than ever before watching
their diets or working harder
at practice in the hopes
that they could be part of an
exceptional ending to an al
ready-special season.
"The excitement's defi
nitely building," Agness said.
"I think everyone's starting
to recognize how much bigger
this game is than any of our
other ones."
"As a senior, [a playoff
run] would validate all of the
time that I put in," Agness
added. "I missed a lot I'd like

to do none of us went to
Coachella and a lot of us
thought it would have been
cool to g0...y0u miss a fair
amount of stuff. It would also
show that we made the right
decision in deciding to come
down to this league... it would
set the platform for perenni
ally making it back to this lev
el."

its rut and build the pro
gram back into prominence.
And although there were
misgivings at times, the de
cision was made to drop the
program from Division I-A
to Division I-AA in order to
give the team an opportuni
ty to re-establish a winning
culture rather than having
losing be the status quo
week after week.
Thus, with higher expec
tations of on-field success for
the team in 2014 at a new
level of competition, the fo
cus of the program shifted to
developing that new culture
and making it a sustainable
team spirit both this season
and for the coming seasons.
Building that new paradigm
began with the upperclass
man leadership Agness
among them that had
stuck with the program
through the trying seasons
and was thus ready to lead
the team in a new direction.

"I think we were a young
team very few upper
classmen [in the past]," said
head coach Matt Sherman.
"I think we struggled to get
the culture right on and off
the field, but the senior play
ers and leadership [this sea
son] have done a fantastic
job of motivating the whole
team, and I think the whole
team has done a great job of
responding and building a
really strong team culture
that wants to work hard for
each other, and the result has
been fantastic."
"When I got here as a
freshman, we didn't have a
coach; we were in the hiring
process and got Coach Sher
man," Agness said. "The be

lief that he's putting us on
the right track and even af
ter last year a really bru
tal season we kind of all
knew that it wasn't perma
nent. With the right recon
struction, the right coaching
and continuing to get the
right guys out here, we
weren't going to stay in the
basement."
After a meeting among
the team's leadership at the
beginning of the season to
establish that push in the
new direction, a strong non
conference showing to open
the season gave the mem
bers of the team the spark
needed to become more fo
cused, more united and more
involved in the effort to push
the program back into rele
vance.
Even through the strug
gles of seasons past, the is
sue has never been that the
team was putting the wrong
people on the field or that it
was performing at a lower
level than its competition.
Those might have been con
tributing factors, sure, but
the main issue was that the
team had lost its confidence,
its drive and its identity.
This season, ignited by its
new leadership, as well as
the contributions of the re
turning team members and a
talented freshman class, the
team got off to a faster start
with a hard-fought win over
the University of San Diego
and narrow losses to tough
non-conference matchups in
Santa Clara and Oregon
State that served to remind
them that they were able to
compete with those con
tenders. After that, the team
blew out San Francisco State
and San Diego State to kick
off the heart of conference
play, and the ball was rolling.
"You get like that little
boost of confidence in the be
ginning, then you remember,
'Oh, yeah, we could be pretty
good,"' Agness said. "Be
cause we've got good athletes
out here who probably played
below their athletic ability
last season and got in a rut.
Once you get that little boost
to get out, we started to put it
together and confidence was
exponential in a lot of ways."

The rest, as they say, is his
tory.
The team caught a groove
and went undefeated through
both the conference season
and the tournament with a
trip to Barbados in the mid
dle to boot. Victories over San
Jose State and Chico State in
the conference tournament
gave the team a champi
onship trophy, but more im
portantly, it gave the mem
bers of the team both old
and new something tangi
ble to hold on to, something to
justify all of the time and ef
fort that they put into the
sport through all of the trials
and tribulations of seasons
past.
And with the national
tournament approaching, the

season gave the team success
and momentum to build on as
it hoped to extend its worst
to-first story to the national
stage. After the success of the
season, players bought into
the collective efforts more
than ever before watching
their diets or working harder
at practice in the hopes
that they could be part of an
exceptional ending to an al
ready-special season.
"The excitement's defi
nitely building," Agness said.
"I think everyone's starting
to recognize how much bigger
this game is than any of our
other ones."
"As a senior, [a playoff
run] would validate all of the
time that I put in," Agness
added. "I missed a lot I'd like

to do none of us went to
Coachella and a lot of us
thought it would have been
cool to g0...y0u miss a fair
amount of stuff. It would also
show that we made the right
decision in deciding to come
down to this league... it would
set the platform for perenni
ally making it back to this lev
el."

SAM GIRVIN/The Stanford Daily
While the men's rugby team bounced back from a winless season during its successful
2014 campaign, the women's team has been consistently among the top in the nation.
For a program that has been playing
continuously on Stanford's campus
since 1906, Stanford rugby has been
relegated to a very understated
niche on campus since its loss of
varsity status in 1977. Although its history is
rife with significant names like that of stand

out quarterback Don Bunce, runs to the rug
by Final Four and other unforgettable mo
ments, the reality of being a club sport on a
campus full of successful NCAA Division I
programs has meant that its successes and
failures in recent history have all gone rela
tively unnoticed.

But over the last weekend, the USA Rug
by National Championship series was set to
take place at Stanford for the Sweet 16 and
Elite Eight matchups of the Western Re-

gional, and both the
men's and women's
teams stood in a
unique position this

season. For the first time in recent memory,
the two teams simultaneously stood as con
ference champions while hosting both nation
al championships, giving each squad the op
portunity to make deep playoff runs on its

home facility.
Although the teams have
seen their fair share of ups
and downs with the men
having suffered a deep rut
over the last several seasons
and the women having en
dured the pain of several
playoff runs coming to un
timely ends this season
has seemed to mark the be
ginning of a significant up
swing for both programs.
The men are set to establish
a precedent of success and
leadership which they will
look to carry them forward
in the next few years. The
women, meanwhile, are
primed to rally behind an in
domitable spirit of unity and
one of the deepest rosters in
memory to finally overcome
the hump and return to the
top of the women's rugby
world.

"While we were losing last
year, it was kind of funny be
cause you would see how the
other club sports were doing,
and I think we were by far
the worst club sport in terms
of win-loss," said senior cap
tain Dan Agness of the men's
team. "Everyone at this
school is so used to killing it;
it's understandable that guys
would want to quit after
something like that. Every
body here is used to being
awesome and exemplary, and
then to come in and join a
team that's anything but ex
emplary it's hard."
The lack of a focused pro
gram on the men's side has
hurt its ability to stay com
petitive over the last two
seasons, with players freer
to give the team as much or
as little commitment as they
wanted without fear of
harsh consequences. The
team also suffered from an
unavoidable amount of inex
perience with rugby that
warranted a greater focus
on individual and team fun
damentals rather than on
overarching strategy during
practices.
And it was more than
that; as a club sport on cam
pus, there wasn't any great
incentive for team members
to sacrifice other elements
of their Stanford experience

and education to spend their
time on a team that would
get blown out by margins of
60 points week after week.
"We absolutely recognize
that we're a club sport," Ag
ness said. "Sometimes, peo
ple will grumble when
Coach makes a morning ses
sion that we thought would
be pretty quick into some
thing intensive."
After the conclusion of a
winless conference season in
2013, it was clear that a
change needed to happen in
order to get the team out of

together and confidence was
exponential in a lot of ways."

The rest, as they say, is his

The team caught a groove
and went undefeated through
both the conference season
and the tournament with a
trip to Barbados in the mid

the conference tournament
gave the team a champi

justify all of the time and ef
fort that they put into the
sport through all of the trials

past.

tournament approaching, the

season gave the team success
and momentum to build on as
it hoped to extend its worst

SAM GIRVIN/The Stanford Daily
While the men's rugby team bounced back from a winless season during its successful
2014 campaign, the women's team has been consistently among the top in the nation.
For a program that has been playing
continuously on Stanford's campus
since 1906, Stanford rugby has been
relegated to a very understated
niche on campus since its loss of
varsity status in 1977. Although its history is
rife with significant names like that of stand

out quarterback Don Bunce, runs to the rug
by Final Four and other unforgettable mo
ments, the reality of being a club sport on a
campus full of successful NCAA Division I
programs has meant that its successes and
failures in recent history have all gone rela
tively unnoticed.

But over the last weekend, the USA Rug
by National Championship series was set to
take place at Stanford for the Sweet 16 and
Elite Eight matchups of the Western Re-

gional, and both the
men's and women's
teams stood in a
unique position this

season. For the first time in recent memory,
the two teams simultaneously stood as con
ference champions while hosting both nation
al championships, giving each squad the op
portunity to make deep playoff runs on its

home facility.
Although the teams have
seen their fair share of ups
and downs with the men
having suffered a deep rut
over the last several seasons
and the women having en
dured the pain of several
playoff runs coming to un
timely ends this season
has seemed to mark the be
ginning of a significant up
swing for both programs.
The men are set to establish
a precedent of success and
leadership which they will
look to carry them forward
in the next few years. The
women, meanwhile, are
primed to rally behind an in
domitable spirit of unity and
one of the deepest rosters in
memory to finally overcome
the hump and return to the
top of the women's rugby
world.

"While we were losing last
year, it was kind of funny be
cause you would see how the
other club sports were doing,
and I think we were by far
the worst club sport in terms
of win-loss," said senior cap
tain Dan Agness of the men's
team. "Everyone at this
school is so used to killing it;
it's understandable that guys
would want to quit after
something like that. Every
body here is used to being
awesome and exemplary, and
then to come in and join a
team that's anything but ex
emplary it's hard."
The lack of a focused pro
gram on the men's side has
hurt its ability to stay com
petitive over the last two
seasons, with players freer
to give the team as much or
as little commitment as they
wanted without fear of
harsh consequences. The
team also suffered from an
unavoidable amount of inex
perience with rugby that
warranted a greater focus
on individual and team fun
damentals rather than on
overarching strategy during
practices.
And it was more than
that; as a club sport on cam
pus, there wasn't any great
incentive for team members
to sacrifice other elements
of their Stanford experience

and education to spend their
time on a team that would
get blown out by margins of
60 points week after week.
"We absolutely recognize
that we're a club sport," Ag
ness said. "Sometimes, peo
ple will grumble when
Coach makes a morning ses
sion that we thought would
be pretty quick into some
thing intensive."
After the conclusion of a
winless conference season in
2013, it was clear that a
change needed to happen in
order to get the team out of
its rut and build the pro
gram back into prominence.
And although there were
misgivings at times, the de
cision was made to drop the
program from Division I-A
to Division I-AA in order to
give the team an opportuni
ty to re-establish a winning
culture rather than having
losing be the status quo
week after week.
Thus, with higher expec
tations of on-field success for
the team in 2014 at a new
level of competition, the fo
cus of the program shifted to
developing that new culture
and making it a sustainable
team spirit both this season
and for the coming seasons.
Building that new paradigm
began with the upperclass
man leadership Agness
among them that had
stuck with the program
through the trying seasons
and was thus ready to lead
the team in a new direction.

"I think we were a young
team very few upper
classmen [in the past]," said
head coach Matt Sherman.
"I think we struggled to get
the culture right on and off
the field, but the senior play
ers and leadership [this sea
son] have done a fantastic
job of motivating the whole
team, and I think the whole
team has done a great job of
responding and building a
really strong team culture
that wants to work hard for
each other, and the result has
been fantastic."
"When I got here as a
freshman, we didn't have a
coach; we were in the hiring
process and got Coach Sher
man," Agness said. "The be

lief that he's putting us on
the right track and even af
ter last year a really bru
tal season we kind of all
knew that it wasn't perma
nent. With the right recon
struction, the right coaching
and continuing to get the
right guys out here, we
weren't going to stay in the
basement."
After a meeting among
the team's leadership at the
beginning of the season to
establish that push in the
new direction, a strong non
conference showing to open
the season gave the mem
bers of the team the spark
needed to become more fo
cused, more united and more
involved in the effort to push
the program back into rele
vance.
Even through the strug
gles of seasons past, the is
sue has never been that the
team was putting the wrong
people on the field or that it
was performing at a lower
level than its competition.
Those might have been con
tributing factors, sure, but
the main issue was that the
team had lost its confidence,
its drive and its identity.
This season, ignited by its
new leadership, as well as
the contributions of the re
turning team members and a
talented freshman class, the
team got off to a faster start
with a hard-fought win over
the University of San Diego
and narrow losses to tough
non-conference matchups in
Santa Clara and Oregon
State that served to remind
them that they were able to
compete with those con
tenders. After that, the team
blew out San Francisco State
and San Diego State to kick
off the heart of conference
play, and the ball was rolling.
"You get like that little
boost of confidence in the be
ginning, then you remember,
'Oh, yeah, we could be pretty
good,"' Agness said. "Be
cause we've got good athletes
out here who probably played
below their athletic ability
last season and got in a rut.
Once you get that little boost
to get out, we started to put it
together and confidence was
exponential in a lot of ways."

The rest, as they say, is his
tory.
The team caught a groove
and went undefeated through
both the conference season
and the tournament with a
trip to Barbados in the mid
dle to boot. Victories over San
Jose State and Chico State in
