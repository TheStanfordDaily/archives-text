## Chaos reigns in overshadowed NBA Playoffs 
### Nicholas Radoff 
There's bedlam in the NBA
absolute chaos. It is
heartening to see the soli
darity, the compassion and
the desire to create posi
tive change that has come about as a
direct consequence to Clippers owner
Donald Sterling's deplorable com
ments. It has also, to an extent,
dimmed the lights on the greatest
NBA playoff show in a long time.
Don't believe me? How about this:
the Eastern Conference was so mon
umentally terrible that NBA Com
missioner Adam Silver stated that he
would "take a fresh look" at the play
off format to perhaps include only the
best 16 teams, according to NBC
Sports. Now, while Silver's comment
is almost certainly an idle threat —if
only because the current format en
sures that a significant portion of the
major markets will be represented
it highlights how historically bad the
East was. So, despite how the Pacers
ended the season, Las Vegas had
them on April 16 at 5-1 odds to get
rings. The Hawks? 1000-1.
It's everywhere: The Mavs bat
tling the Spurs, the impossible-to
judge (and Brook-less) Nets maybe
coming together at the right time, the
Grizzlies silently grinding out games
against the Thunder, and all of a sud
den, the Wizards are the best team in
D.C.
For a moment, it would appear
that Robin Lopez is a part of all the
upheaval, but it may have been a long
time coming. There is no doubt that he
struggled during his time in Phoenix.
He certainly developed in his last two
years there despite injuries that
stymied his growth. But it was clear*
that he was continually uncomfortable
playing in his role for the Suns. Head
coach Mike D'Antoni's offense and
fast play were never really a fit for
Lopez. When he moved to New Or
leans and then on to Portland, there
were four important changes.
First was the switch to a slower
half-court, set offense. Second, per
haps due to a slower game, Lopez was
finally able to stay healthy. Third, he
was in a situation that did not put too
much pressure on him offensively, yet
demanded significantly more of him
than in Phoenix. But the most signifi
cant change by far* was his transfor
mation into a tremendous defensive
player, and the Trail Blazers are see
ing dividends. In Lopez's only year* in
New Orleans and his first full season,
he amassed 462 rebounds —226 of
which were offensive and 128
blocks. His best numbers before that
came in 2011-12, in which he played 64
games —remarkably, without start
ing a single game and had 209
boards and 60 blocks. This year, Robin
Lopez had 700 rebounds 326 offen
sive —to go with 139 blocks, all the
while reducing his turnovers Irom last
season's 110 to 84 and turning himself
into an adept passer with 73 assists
down low.
A lot has been made of Joakim
Noah's emergence this year in the
same mould. Noah turned himself in
to a lethal passer at the point and, al
ready an elite defender, had his best
year* defensively. While Noah, by
many accounts not this writer's
was an MVP candidate for a signifi
cant portion of the year*, Lopez barely
breaks the list for Most Improved
Player. Those of us who watched him
buckle down Dwight Howard after his
first-quarter barrage, blocking him
clean at key fourth-quarter moments
on Sunday night, saw a top-10 defen
sive center play for the Blazers, and
his name was not LaMarcus Aldridge.
Lopez's emergence, lest we forget,
has occurred incredibly quickly Three
year*s ago, he lost his starting job at
the end of his rookie contract, which,
in the NBA is just an awful spot to be
in. Two teams later, and he is the
leader of a Portland defense that is
shutting down one of the most potent
offenses in the NBA in the Houston
Rockets. Still don't think these play
offs are crazy?
Robin Lopez has 37 rebounds so
far* this postseason and Roy Hibbert
has 17. And Hibbert has played in
one more game than Lopez. Short of
something involving a basketball and
pastel aliens, I have no explanation
for this. Maybe once the dust settles,
it will all start making sense I can
bitterly watch the Heat play the
Spurs or the Thunder and know that
although I may be miserable, all is
right with the world. But if Lopez's
emergence is any indication, we may
be in for* a wild ride.

Nicholas Radoff can't help but remi
nisce back to when Robin Lopez was
tearing it up in Maples Pavilion
when The Sixth Man was all strick
en with laryngitis due, to the amount
of times they chanted "you got swat
ted!" in a given game. Help him get
over it at nradoff@stanford.edu.
