# RETURN TO FINAL FOUR
## STANFORD SWEEPS ERSKINE TO SET UP SHOWDOWN WITH BYU 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 3 seed Stanford men's
volleyball team swept the No. 6 seed
Erskine in its NCAA play-in match
on Tuesday night, clinching a spot in
the Final Four with the 25-14,25-16,
25-15 win. The win sets up a show
down against conference rival No. 2
seed BYU in the semifinal match,
the only team to which the Cardinal
have lost in over two months.

"We are excited to earn the right
to play in the Final Four," said head
coach John Kosty after the match.
"Erskine is a solid team. They run
their* program well and they fought
hard."

Erskine, in just the second year
of its men's volleyball program's ex
istence, earned an automatic berth in
the NCAA Tournament by capturing
the Conference Carolinas champi
onship. Though Erskine has quickly
established itself within the volley
ball world, it is still a young and inex
perienced team that has faced much
weaker competition in conference
than Stanford, which took on the na
tion's top-ranked teams in the MPSF.
The Cardinal, which have made the
postseason the last seven seasons,
had an advantage at the outset solely
from having experience playing in
high-pressure matches.

Stanford came out with high in
tensity and played to its full potential
from the start of the match, not giv
ing Erskine any chances to feel com
fortable. After struggling to main
tain control and momentum in Satur
day's MPSF final loss to BYU, Stan
ford captured an early 18-11 lead in
Tuesday's match, forcing Erskine in
to catch-up mode. Stanford out-hit its
opponent .545 to .111 in the first set,
taking the set 25-14.
In the second set, Stanford once
again busted out to an early advan
tage and dominated in blocking. The
Cardinal held the Flying Fleet to a -
.069 hitting percentage in the second
set, forcing more errors (seven) than
the team had kills (five). Senior Eric
Mochalski had a big role in the
frame, hitting .700 in the 25-16 win.
And the third set proved to be much
of the same, as Stanford finished off
the sweep with a 25-16 win.
The Cardinal hit .423 in the match
and held Erskine to just .043 for the
night. The offense was led by senior
AU-American outside hitter Brian
Cook with 12 kills and a .526 hitting
percentage. Cook has had a phenom
enal season for the Cardinal and
came out swinging from the begin
ning. Seniors Steven Irvin and Eric
Mochalski also had impressive
nights, tallying nine and seven kills
respectively.
"We just wanted to play Stan
ford volleyball tonight," said Irvin.
"We had to serve and pass well and
the offense would take care of it-

Though the Cardinal still
has room for improvement in
their serving game, they had
just 12 service errors in the
match, compared to the 17
errors in the loss to BYU,
their first in 14 matches.
As a team, Stanford com
pletely dominated the under
sized Flying Fleet at the net,
out-blocking them 13-2.
Sophomore middle Conrad
Kaminski had a match-high
six blocks. Senior libero
Grant Delgado also had a
match-high 11 digs, balancing
Stanford's performance with
a dominant defensive effort.
Erskine was led by fresh
man outside hitter Roberto
Perez Vargas, who had nine
kills and four digs in the
match. Sophomore outside
hitter and Conference Caroli
nas MVP Michael Michelau
was also at the center of the
Flying Fleet's offense with
eight kills and eight digs.
With the win, Stanford
will play in the Final Four for
the first time since 2010,
when the team won the pro
gram's second NCAA title.
The Cardinal will face BYU,
a familiar, yet difficult oppo
nent that has beaten Stan
ford twice already this sea
son. Yet both teams play sim
ilar styles, and Stanford will
be looking for revenge
against the team that ended
its 13-match winning streak.
First serve in the national
semifinal is set for 4 p.m. on
Thursday at Gentile Arena in
Chicago.

The No. 3 seed Stanford men's
volleyball team swept the No. 6 seed
Erskine in its NCAA play-in match
on Tuesday night, clinching a spot in
the Final Four with the 25-14,25-16,
25-15 win. The win sets up a show
down against conference rival No. 2
seed BYU in the semifinal match,
the only team to which the Cardinal
have lost in over two months.

"We are excited to earn the right
to play in the Final Four," said head
coach John Kosty after the match.
"Erskine is a solid team. They run
their* program well and they fought
hard."

Erskine, in just the second year
of its men's volleyball program's ex
istence, earned an automatic berth in
the NCAA Tournament by capturing
the Conference Carolinas champi
onship. Though Erskine has quickly
established itself within the volley
ball world, it is still a young and inex
perienced team that has faced much
weaker competition in conference
than Stanford, which took on the na
tion's top-ranked teams in the MPSF.
The Cardinal, which have made the
postseason the last seven seasons,
had an advantage at the outset solely
from having experience playing in
high-pressure matches.

Stanford came out with high in
tensity and played to its full potential
from the start of the match, not giv
ing Erskine any chances to feel com
fortable. After struggling to main
tain control and momentum in Satur
day's MPSF final loss to BYU, Stan
ford captured an early 18-11 lead in
Tuesday's match, forcing Erskine in
to catch-up mode. Stanford out-hit its
opponent .545 to .111 in the first set,
taking the set 25-14.
In the second set, Stanford once
again busted out to an early advan
tage and dominated in blocking. The
Cardinal held the Flying Fleet to a -
.069 hitting percentage in the second
set, forcing more errors (seven) than
the team had kills (five). Senior Eric
Mochalski had a big role in the
frame, hitting .700 in the 25-16 win.
And the third set proved to be much
of the same, as Stanford finished off
the sweep with a 25-16 win.
The Cardinal hit .423 in the match
and held Erskine to just .043 for the
night. The offense was led by senior
AU-American outside hitter Brian
Cook with 12 kills and a .526 hitting
percentage. Cook has had a phenom
enal season for the Cardinal and
came out swinging from the begin
ning. Seniors Steven Irvin and Eric
Mochalski also had impressive
nights, tallying nine and seven kills
respectively.
"We just wanted to play Stan
ford volleyball tonight," said Irvin.
