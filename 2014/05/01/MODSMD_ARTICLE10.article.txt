## Media shouldn't be hammering Winston 
### Do-Hyoung Park 
Raise your hand if you ever
did anything stupid as a
teenager or young adult.
Unless you're not yet the
age of 13 and are exhibit
ing some precocious reading skills (and
an unusual affinity for sports opinions),
your hand should be in the air right
now Because in today's popular cul
ture, stupidity is closely associated the
teenage lifestyle regrettable life
choices, learning about life decisions the
hard way and sometimes suffering the
consequences of those poor decisions.
So when the news broke that Flori
da State all-everything quarterback
Jameis Winston had been cited by po
lice for shoplifting around 30 dollars'
worth of crab legs, why is it such a
monumental event that the entire
sports world collectively goes nuts? Is
a stupid decision on the part of a 20-
year-old college student really some
thing so groundbreaking and unex
pected that it merits thousands of
tweets and hundreds of news stories?
"But Do," you might say. "Jameis
Winston isn't just any 20-year-old
college student! He won the national
championship! He won the Heisman
Trophy! I'm planning on naming my
first-born child after him!"
Why does that change anything at
all?
Just because Winston is really real
ly good at throwing an inflated bladder
to other college students doesn't mean
that he isn't a college student learning
about how to make proper life decisions
just like the rest of us. The argument
that because he's in the media spotlight,
he should be expected to conduct him
self more responsibly even off the field
is unfair to him; we can't expect him to
suddenly mature just because of the ex
pectations placed on him.
While it's true that it's important for
those athletes that are looked to as role
models by the younger generation to be
leader's off the field as well, I think that
it's unreasonable to expect them to ful
fill that role if they're also trying to
learn to find their' way in the world
themselves. He's a college sophomore,
for God's sake. His unwise actions
aren't that uncommon for young peo
ple his age, and while I'm not trying to
defend his shoplifting in any way it's
ridiculous that something this common
place is garnering so much attentioa
Winston is a man that will face the
consequences of his stupid decision just
like anyone else would in his position.
He's being fined and he'll need to do
community service. There. It should
be all said and done at that. But be
cause the media latched onto the sto
ry and made as big of a deal out of it as
it did, people around the nation are
pasting his face onto newly created
memes, poking fun at his position and
questioning his maturity. That's
overkill. The man walked out of a store
with crab legs; it's not like he robbed a
bank or ran over anyone with a car or
anything. Just let the issue go.
But with the state of sports media to
day the issue isn't going to go away
Heaven knows that this label of crab-leg
stealer is going to stick with him through
the rest of the offseason, at least, and
possibly throughout his career, just be
cause of the media's infatuation with him
as the reigning national champion and
Heisman Trophy winner.
Especially during the offseason,
when big news is slow and writer's are
scrambling for fresh content involving
the characters that make their* jobs pos
sible during the season, it's the little
things like this that have no business
exploding on the national scene and be
come the biggest news of the day The
details of what Jameis Winston does in
his spare time and the consequences of
what he might do in that spare time
should be Jameis Winston's business
and Jameis Winston's business alone.
Unless his decisions seriously bring
his judgment into question in away that
would negatively impact the image of
Florida State's program, or have a neg
ative impact on the team as a whole, it's
a huge blow to the personal privacy of
this 20-year-old to have every mistake
he makes magnified and critiqued on a
global level.
So seriously, everybody leave
Jameis alone. Let him have his offsea
son in peace, and don't make his busi
ness yours until football time again,
when news involving his activities is
once again rightfully relevant to the na
tional sphere.

While Do-Hyoung Park believes all
the attention surrounding this issue
is warrantless, he still thinks Fa
mous Jameis took a pretty bisque--y
move. Forward all appropriate crus
tacean-related recipes at
dparko27@stanford.edu and Tweet
him. @dohyoungpark 'with #risky
bisqueness.
