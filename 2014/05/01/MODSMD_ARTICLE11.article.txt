# FOURTH TIME'S A CHARM?
## CARD FACE BYU IN NCAA SEMI-FINAL MATCH 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 3 Stanford men's volley
ball squad will face No. 2 BYU in the
NCAA Tournament semifinals to
day in Chicago, Illinois. This will be
the fourth meeting between the two
teams this season. The tilt will be a
rematch of last week's MPSF con
ference championship game that
BYU won, ending the Cardinal's 13-
match winning streak.
While the Cougars also won the
two regular season matchups with
Stanford, BYU barely beat out the
Card at Maples earlier in the season
and that was before Stanford's
midseason improvement. Plus, with

MPSF Championship game. On the
other hand, Stanford had to face Er

No. 6 seed Erskine is a program on
the rise, Stanford scored an easy
win against the Flying Fleet and
seemed more than ready for the in
creased pressure of the tournament.
Although BYU will have had a
longer break than Stanford

Cougars last Saturday, Stanford has
won all of its games in March and
April, marking 14 victories in its last
15 contests.
Head coach John Kosty was

Year on Wednesday, an award he al
