# FOURTH TIME'S A CHARM?
## CARD FACE BYU IN NCAA SEMI-FINAL MATCH 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 3 Stanford men's volley
ball squad will face No. 2 BYU in the
NCAA Tournament semifinals to
day in Chicago, Illinois. This will be
the fourth meeting between the two
teams this season. The tilt will be a
rematch of last week's MPSF con
ference championship game that
BYU won, ending the Cardinal's 13-
match winning streak.
While the Cougars also won the
two regular season matchups with
Stanford, BYU barely beat out the
Card at Maples earlier in the season
and that was before Stanford's
midseason improvement. Plus, with
the NCAA Tournament hosted by
Loyola University in Chicago, BYU
will not be able to feed off of the
strong home-court advantage it en
joyed in Provo, Utah.
Still, the Cougars sit atop the na
tional rankings and boast the No. 2
seed in the NCAA Tournament, be
hind No. 1 seed Loyola-Chicago.
BYU received a bye to the semifi
nals by beating out Stanford in the
MPSF Championship game. On the
other hand, Stanford had to face Er
skine College on Tuesday in a play
in match, after not earning an auto
matic berth to the Big Dance. While
No. 6 seed Erskine is a program on
the rise, Stanford scored an easy
win against the Flying Fleet and
seemed more than ready for the in
creased pressure of the tournament.
Although BYU will have had a
longer break than Stanford
which could provide the Cougars
with much-needed rest the Car
dinal certainly have more momen
tum. Aside from the loss to the
Cougars last Saturday, Stanford has
won all of its games in March and
April, marking 14 victories in its last
15 contests.
Head coach John Kosty was
named the 2014 MPSF Coach of the
Year on Wednesday, an award he al
so won in 2010 when Stanford cap
tured the program's second national
title. Losing only eight matches this
season, and only one match in the
second half of the season, Kosty has

helped form a confident and
close unit. The team exhibit
ed incredible perseverance
when it went 9-7 to start the
season before embarking on
the impressive 13-match win
ning streak. This season,
Stanford has downed nine
top-10 teams with BYU
being the glaring exception.
The Cardinal have yet to find
away to overcome the
Cougars' imposing defense
and strong attack.
Stanford has the second
best hitting percentage na
tionally this season, and is at
the top of the MPSF with a
.337 mark. One of the keys to
the Card's success has been
the key balance the team has

maintained between aggres
sion and patience while on
the attack, a combination
that can be hard to maintain
but powerful when a team
manages to find the right
equilibrium.
All-American Brian Cook
leads the Cardinal with 3.81
kills per set and has recorded
dominant performances
against BYU, hitting .483
against the Cougars. Conrad
Kaminski, the only player in
the MPSF with an above-,500
hitting percentage, averages
1.08 blocks per set to lead
Stanford's defense. Second
team All-Americans James
Shaw and Steven Irvin con
tribute with consistently
strong offensive performanc
es, highlighting the fact that
many players on the roster
can make big plays and step
up in critical moments.
BYU counters with its

leading scorer, four-time Ail-
American and MPSF Tour
nament MVP Taylor Sander.
He leads the team in kills and
points, with 4.55 kills per set
and 5.43 points per set.
Sander has yet to have a bad
match this season, and can
make big plays down the
stretch. Michael Hatch has
also been critical to BYU's
success this season, with the
highest blocking average of
any player in the NCAA
Tournament at 1.45 blocks
per set.
No. 3 seed Stanford will
take on No. 2 seed BYU in
the NCAA Semifinals at 4 p.m.
today in Chicago. Should the
Cardinal advance, they will face
the victor of the Loyola-Chica
go/Penn State matchup in the
championship game.

The No. 3 Stanford men's volley
ball squad will face No. 2 BYU in the
NCAA Tournament semifinals to
day in Chicago, Illinois. This will be
the fourth meeting between the two
teams this season. The tilt will be a
rematch of last week's MPSF con
ference championship game that
BYU won, ending the Cardinal's 13-
match winning streak.
While the Cougars also won the
two regular season matchups with
Stanford, BYU barely beat out the
Card at Maples earlier in the season
and that was before Stanford's
midseason improvement. Plus, with
the NCAA Tournament hosted by
Loyola University in Chicago, BYU
will not be able to feed off of the
strong home-court advantage it en
joyed in Provo, Utah.
Still, the Cougars sit atop the na
tional rankings and boast the No. 2
seed in the NCAA Tournament, be
hind No. 1 seed Loyola-Chicago.
BYU received a bye to the semifi
nals by beating out Stanford in the
MPSF Championship game. On the
other hand, Stanford had to face Er
skine College on Tuesday in a play
in match, after not earning an auto
matic berth to the Big Dance. While
No. 6 seed Erskine is a program on
the rise, Stanford scored an easy
win against the Flying Fleet and
seemed more than ready for the in
creased pressure of the tournament.
Although BYU will have had a
longer break than Stanford
which could provide the Cougars
with much-needed rest the Car
dinal certainly have more momen
tum. Aside from the loss to the
Cougars last Saturday, Stanford has
won all of its games in March and
April, marking 14 victories in its last
15 contests.
Head coach John Kosty was
named the 2014 MPSF Coach of the
Year on Wednesday, an award he al
so won in 2010 when Stanford cap

title. Losing only eight matches this
season, and only one match in the
second half of the season, Kosty has

close unit. The team exhibit
ed incredible perseverance
when it went 9-7 to start the
season before embarking on
the impressive 13-match win
ning streak. This season,
Stanford has downed nine
top-10 teams with BYU
being the glaring exception.
The Cardinal have yet to find
away to overcome the
Cougars' imposing defense
and strong attack.
Stanford has the second
best hitting percentage na
tionally this season, and is at
the top of the MPSF with a
.337 mark. One of the keys to
the Card's success has been
the key balance the team has

maintained between aggres
sion and patience while on
the attack, a combination
that can be hard to maintain
but powerful when a team
manages to find the right
equilibrium.
All-American Brian Cook
leads the Cardinal with 3.81
kills per set and has recorded
dominant performances
against BYU, hitting .483
against the Cougars. Conrad
Kaminski, the only player in
the MPSF with an above-,500

1.08 blocks per set to lead
Stanford's defense. Second
team All-Americans James
Shaw and Steven Irvin con

strong offensive performanc
es, highlighting the fact that
many players on the roster
can make big plays and step
up in critical moments.
BYU counters with its

leading scorer, four-time Ail-
American and MPSF Tour
nament MVP Taylor Sander.
He leads the team in kills and
points, with 4.55 kills per set
and 5.43 points per set.
Sander has yet to have a bad
match this season, and can
make big plays down the
stretch. Michael Hatch has
also been critical to BYU's
success this season, with the
highest blocking average of
any player in the NCAA
Tournament at 1.45 blocks
per set.
