## CHINEY'S LAST GO-AROUND 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
At the beginning of the season,
Chiney Ogwumike told me that the
team's final goal was a national ti
tle; although the Cardinal fell
short, reaching the Final Four is a
huge milestone.
I was fortunate enough to be
the voice of Stanford women's bas

ketball for KZSU almost every
game en route to this year's Final
Four, and I was there when the
Card failed to win that elusive na
tional title.
That loss left a smudge on an
otherwise stellar season. Ogwu
mike, the 2014 John R. Wooden
National Player of the Year, might
not have gotten that championship
ring she deserved, but it was still

an incredible season.
"Our depth, and having so
many people contributing in so
many games, it made [the season]
that much more fun because every
one had that sense of urgency to
keep playing and that made each
possession that much more impor
tant," Ogwumike said. "We may
have hit some bumps in the road
but we played so hard for each oth

er in away that's different than in
the past."
The main theme of this year's
team was the need for greater con
tributions from more players,
aside from the big numbers Ogwu
mike was putting up every night.
Point guard Amber Orrange
stepped up at key moments in the
season and continued to be a
silent weapon for the Cardi
nal offense and defense, of
ten coming through when
she was needed most while
making the players around
her better with her dead-eye
passing and dribble penetra
tion.
The biggest breakout
star, though, was senior
Mikaela Ruef another
player who involves others
around her and plays with an
unselfish mindset. Despite
her inclination to let others
do the scoring, Ruef put
aside her selfless tendencies
in the Elite Eight game
against UNC when she was
needed most, finishing the
game with three 3-pointers
and a career-high 17 points.
"Playing with someone
like Mikaela was fun because
of how hard she worked, and
how we were both going at it
Batman and Robin style all
year," Ogwumike said.
A different player
stepped up to compliment
the dominant play of Ogwu
mike each game. That made
it hard for competitors to fo
cus their defenses on any
particular area of the court,
or target any one player be
sides Ogwumike.
Throughout the season,
Stanford's star forward
proved that she had not be
come complacent with her
skills and level of perform
ance, as some questioned she
might after last season.
Proving to be so much more
physically mature than the
majority of her competitors,
her work paid off in the form
of numerous records, acco
lades and the No. 1 WNBA
draft pick never letting
her older sister, Nneka Og
wumike 'l2, out-do her in any
regard.
Despite all of the individ
ual and team success, the
season still had its ups and
downs. After an early-season
loss to Connecticut, the Card
went on a twenty-game win
streak before faltering at
Washington.
To be fair, I don't think
anyone realizes what a tough
road trip that was for the
Card. The team had to con
tend with a near-two-hour
flight delay on the Thursday
night before the game, then
practice the next morning
and a two hour drive to Pull
man to play Washington
State. A flight to Seattle on
Saturday, their "off day,"
took up the whole morning
before another practice,
which was then followed by a
long team dinner afterwards
at the house of a friend of the
team that was further
stretched out by a snow de
lay.

By the 12:30 p.m. tipoff
on Sunday, the team was
tired. After the loss, head
coach Tara VanDerveer was
adamant on the bus when
she said that every player
was important, and had to be
accountable for each and
every game.
Los Angeles was another
notable road trip, as the
team overcame the eighth
largest deficit â€”l9 points

in NCAA history to beat
USC. Stanford then won the
Pac-12 title outright with a
narrow win over UCLA, in
dicating that the Pac-12
Tournament would be no
walk in the park and it
wasn't.
In the third meeting of
the season between the two
teams, the Trojans didn't let
the Card take away another
winnable game, and it was
the Cardinal who left the
arena with a devastating loss
that time around.
"The Washington loss, we
knew we didn't shoot the ball
well, so if we shot well we
probably could've changed
the outcome of that game.
But [against] USC, we tried
and we played hard, and usu
ally when we play hard, we
win in conference," said Og
wumike. "And USC found a
way to out-grit us and out
hustle us in away that was
different than before."
The only thing I heard
VanDerveer say when she
was on the bus was some
thing along the lines of,
"They better not send us
back to this place," referring
to the possibility of having to
make a third trip to Seattle
for the first round of the
NCAA Tournament. The
loss, however, was a turn
around for the team late in
the season that provided a
reminder that they were not
invincible.
"If we didn't lose to USC,
I'm not sure how far we
would have made it in the
[NCAA] Tournament, quite
frankly," Ogwumike said.
"That really reorganized our
offense, and we had a huge
sense of urgency because we
knew that we were vulnera
ble to lose at any point."
Stanford bulldozed
through the first two rounds
of the tournament and re
turned to Maples for a win
against the Tar Heels, what
Ogwumike believes was the
team's most exciting and re
warding win of the season.
The seniors were able to
leave Maples for the last
time with a bang after de
feating UNC and earning a
trip to the Final Four. When
I walked in to congratulate
the team, the energy in the
locker room was electric
country music blaring and
fried chicken galore and
that same energy trans
ferred over on the trip to
Music City.
Once in Nashville, No. 2
Stanford knew it was the un
derdog going up against No.
1 Connecticut. The Cardinal
decided to take a relaxed ap
proach towards the game, fo
cusing on having fun and not
getting too tight. Stanford
finished up its open practice
the day before the Final
Four with Sara James lead
ing some of the players and
VanDerveer in a round of
line dancing. The strategy
worked somewhat because
the Cardinal came out confi
dent and poised in the first
half of play, but Connecticut
was just too good to be beat
en by anyone this year.
When Ogwumike was

pulled out of the game for
the last time wearing a Stan
ford jersey, there was almost
a collective inhalation from
the fans in the arena when
they realized that they were
saying their farewell to
Chiney Ogwumike one of
the greatest athletes in Stan
ford women's basketball his
tory and that the Cardinal
had missed out on another
national title.
"After the loss in the Fi
nal Four, Erica Payne was
bawling and I told her it was
okay," Ogwumike said. "But
she said, 'I wish we could
have done this for you.' And I
said, 'No, I wish I could have
played better for you.' It's
one of those things when the
people were just so selfless
and you have this huge sis
terhood. Playing for each
other means so much to us,
more than anything, and
that's the culture we've got
in our Stanford basketball
locker room."
The plane ride home was
not filled with disappoint
ment, but with renewed
drive and determination for
the season to come. Ogwu
mike told me at the begin
ning of the year that the win
dow of opportunity to get to
the Final Four is always
open at Stanford.
While Ogwumike and
Ruef are already preparing
for the next chapter in their
careers the WNBA
fellow seniors Sara James
and Toni Kokenis are
preparing for the first chap
ter in their non-basketball
lives. James will enroll in Co
lumbia University's nursing
program, while Kokenis will
continue her studies at Stan
ford as a co-term in sociology
while also saving time to
start a non-profit. The re
mainder of the team is about
to start spring training and
look ahead to next season.
Ogwumike praised the
freshman class this year for
the diverse skill sets that
each of them brought to the
team this year, especially Lili
Thompson, who broke into
the starting lineup before
Pac-12 play even started.
And Ogwumike still keeps
tabs on Erica McCall, her
"protege," to make sure
she's doing what she needs
to do to succeed.
"With the departure of
each senior class, people
have always had more and
more doubt ... and each year,
people have stepped up and
we've succeeded beyond
those doubts and expecta
tions, so I know they'll suc
ceed and find away," Ogwu
mike said. "People are going
to have to take on bigger
roles offensively. I'm not
worried about them. They're
very talented and they just
need to show it to the world."

Next season might be a
rebuilding period, but if the
past is any indication, Stan
ford women's basketball will
continue to remain one of the
premier programs in the na
tion.

"Our depth, and having so
many people contributing in so
many games, it made [the season]
that much more fun because every
one had that sense of urgency to
keep playing and that made each
possession that much more impor
tant," Ogwumike said. "We may
have hit some bumps in the road
but we played so hard for each oth

er in away that's different than in
the past."
The main theme of this year's
team was the need for greater con
tributions from more players,
aside from the big numbers Ogwu
mike was putting up every night.
Point guard Amber Orrange
stepped up at key moments in the
season and continued to be a
silent weapon for the Cardi
nal offense and defense, of
ten coming through when
she was needed most while
making the players around
her better with her dead-eye
passing and dribble penetra
tion.
The biggest breakout
star, though, was senior
Mikaela Ruef another
player who involves others
around her and plays with an
unselfish mindset. Despite
her inclination to let others
do the scoring, Ruef put
aside her selfless tendencies
in the Elite Eight game
against UNC when she was
needed most, finishing the
game with three 3-pointers
and a career-high 17 points.
"Playing with someone
like Mikaela was fun because
of how hard she worked, and
how we were both going at it
Batman and Robin style all
year," Ogwumike said.
A different player
stepped up to compliment
the dominant play of Ogwu
mike each game. That made
it hard for competitors to fo
cus their defenses on any
particular area of the court,
or target any one player be
sides Ogwumike.
Throughout the season,
Stanford's star forward
proved that she had not be
come complacent with her
skills and level of perform
ance, as some questioned she
might after last season.
Proving to be so much more
physically mature than the
majority of her competitors,
her work paid off in the form
of numerous records, acco
lades and the No. 1 WNBA
draft pick never letting
her older sister, Nneka Og
wumike 'l2, out-do her in any
regard.
Despite all of the individ
ual and team success, the
season still had its ups and
downs. After an early-season
loss to Connecticut, the Card
went on a twenty-game win
streak before faltering at
Washington.
To be fair, I don't think
anyone realizes what a tough
road trip that was for the
Card. The team had to con
tend with a near-two-hour
flight delay on the Thursday
night before the game, then
practice the next morning
and a two hour drive to Pull
man to play Washington
State. A flight to Seattle on
Saturday, their "off day,"
took up the whole morning
before another practice,
which was then followed by a
long team dinner afterwards
at the house of a friend of the
team that was further
stretched out by a snow de
lay.

By the 12:30 p.m. tipoff
on Sunday, the team was
tired. After the loss, head
coach Tara VanDerveer was
adamant on the bus when
she said that every player
was important, and had to be
accountable for each and
every game.
Los Angeles was another
notable road trip, as the
team overcame the eighth
largest deficit â€”l9 points

in NCAA history to beat
USC. Stanford then won the
Pac-12 title outright with a
narrow win over UCLA, in
dicating that the Pac-12
Tournament would be no
walk in the park and it
wasn't.
In the third meeting of
the season between the two
teams, the Trojans didn't let
the Card take away another
winnable game, and it was
the Cardinal who left the
arena with a devastating loss
that time around.
"The Washington loss, we
knew we didn't shoot the ball
well, so if we shot well we
probably could've changed
the outcome of that game.
But [against] USC, we tried
and we played hard, and usu
ally when we play hard, we
win in conference," said Og
wumike. "And USC found a
way to out-grit us and out
hustle us in away that was
different than before."
The only thing I heard
VanDerveer say when she
was on the bus was some
thing along the lines of,
"They better not send us
back to this place," referring
to the possibility of having to
make a third trip to Seattle
for the first round of the
NCAA Tournament. The
loss, however, was a turn
around for the team late in
the season that provided a
reminder that they were not
invincible.
"If we didn't lose to USC,
I'm not sure how far we
would have made it in the
[NCAA] Tournament, quite
frankly," Ogwumike said.
"That really reorganized our
offense, and we had a huge
sense of urgency because we
knew that we were vulnera
ble to lose at any point."
Stanford bulldozed
through the first two rounds
of the tournament and re
turned to Maples for a win
against the Tar Heels, what
Ogwumike believes was the
team's most exciting and re
warding win of the season.
The seniors were able to
leave Maples for the last
time with a bang after de
feating UNC and earning a
trip to the Final Four. When
I walked in to congratulate
the team, the energy in the
locker room was electric
country music blaring and
fried chicken galore and
that same energy trans
ferred over on the trip to
Music City.
Once in Nashville, No. 2
Stanford knew it was the un
derdog going up against No.
1 Connecticut. The Cardinal
decided to take a relaxed ap
proach towards the game, fo
cusing on having fun and not
getting too tight. Stanford
finished up its open practice
the day before the Final
Four with Sara James lead
ing some of the players and
VanDerveer in a round of
line dancing. The strategy
worked somewhat because
the Cardinal came out confi
dent and poised in the first
half of play, but Connecticut
was just too good to be beat
en by anyone this year.
When Ogwumike was

pulled out of the game for
the last time wearing a Stan
ford jersey, there was almost
a collective inhalation from
the fans in the arena when
they realized that they were
saying their farewell to
Chiney Ogwumike one of
the greatest athletes in Stan
ford women's basketball his
tory and that the Cardinal
had missed out on another
national title.
"After the loss in the Fi
nal Four, Erica Payne was
bawling and I told her it was
okay," Ogwumike said. "But
she said, 'I wish we could
have done this for you.' And I
said, 'No, I wish I could have
played better for you.' It's
one of those things when the
people were just so selfless
and you have this huge sis
terhood. Playing for each
other means so much to us,
more than anything, and
that's the culture we've got
in our Stanford basketball
locker room."
The plane ride home was
not filled with disappoint
ment, but with renewed
drive and determination for
the season to come. Ogwu
mike told me at the begin
ning of the year that the win
dow of opportunity to get to
the Final Four is always
open at Stanford.
While Ogwumike and
Ruef are already preparing
for the next chapter in their
careers the WNBA
fellow seniors Sara James
and Toni Kokenis are
preparing for the first chap
ter in their non-basketball
lives. James will enroll in Co
lumbia University's nursing
program, while Kokenis will
continue her studies at Stan
ford as a co-term in sociology
while also saving time to
start a non-profit. The re
mainder of the team is about
to start spring training and
look ahead to next season.
Ogwumike praised the
freshman class this year for
the diverse skill sets that
each of them brought to the
team this year, especially Lili
Thompson, who broke into
the starting lineup before
Pac-12 play even started.
And Ogwumike still keeps
tabs on Erica McCall, her
"protege," to make sure
she's doing what she needs
to do to succeed.
"With the departure of
each senior class, people
have always had more and
more doubt ... and each year,
people have stepped up and
we've succeeded beyond
those doubts and expecta
tions, so I know they'll suc
ceed and find away," Ogwu
mike said. "People are going
to have to take on bigger
roles offensively. I'm not
worried about them. They're
very talented and they just
need to show it to the world."

Next season might be a
rebuilding period, but if the
past is any indication, Stan
ford women's basketball will
continue to remain one of the
premier programs in the na
tion.

Senior forward Chiney Ogwumike (above) impressed in her final season on the Farm, averaging
26.1 points and 12.1 rebounds per game en route to earning the Wooden Award.
At the beginning of the season,
Chiney Ogwumike told me that the
team's final goal was a national ti

short, reaching the Final Four is a
huge milestone.
I was fortunate enough to be

she was needed most while
making the players around
her better with her dead-eye
passing and dribble penetra
tion.
The biggest breakout
star, though, was senior
Mikaela Ruef another
player who involves others
around her and plays with an
unselfish mindset. Despite
her inclination to let others
do the scoring, Ruef put
aside her selfless tendencies
in the Elite Eight game
against UNC when she was
needed most, finishing the
game with three 3-pointers
and a career-high 17 points.
"Playing with someone
like Mikaela was fun because
of how hard she worked, and
how we were both going at it
Batman and Robin style all
year," Ogwumike said.
A different player
stepped up to compliment
the dominant play of Ogwu
mike each game. That made
it hard for competitors to fo
cus their defenses on any
particular area of the court,
or target any one player be
sides Ogwumike.
Throughout the season,
Stanford's star forward
proved that she had not be
come complacent with her
skills and level of perform
ance, as some questioned she
might after last season.
Proving to be so much more
physically mature than the
majority of her competitors,
her work paid off in the form
of numerous records, acco
lades and the No. 1 WNBA
draft pick never letting
her older sister, Nneka Og
wumike 'l2, out-do her in any
regard.
Despite all of the individ
ual and team success, the
season still had its ups and
downs. After an early-season
loss to Connecticut, the Card
went on a twenty-game win
streak before faltering at
Washington.
To be fair, I don't think
anyone realizes what a tough
road trip that was for the
Card. The team had to con
tend with a near-two-hour
flight delay on the Thursday
night before the game, then
practice the next morning
and a two hour drive to Pull
man to play Washington
State. A flight to Seattle on
Saturday, their "off day,"
took up the whole morning
before another practice,
which was then followed by a
long team dinner afterwards
at the house of a friend of the
team that was further
stretched out by a snow de
lay.

By the 12:30 p.m. tipoff
on Sunday, the team was
tired. After the loss, head
coach Tara VanDerveer was
adamant on the bus when
she said that every player
was important, and had to be
accountable for each and
every game.
Los Angeles was another
notable road trip, as the
team overcame the eighth
largest deficit â€”l9 points

in NCAA history to beat
USC. Stanford then won the
Pac-12 title outright with a
narrow win over UCLA, in
dicating that the Pac-12
Tournament would be no
walk in the park and it
wasn't.
In the third meeting of
the season between the two
teams, the Trojans didn't let
the Card take away another
winnable game, and it was
the Cardinal who left the
arena with a devastating loss
that time around.
"The Washington loss, we
knew we didn't shoot the ball
well, so if we shot well we
probably could've changed
the outcome of that game.
But [against] USC, we tried
and we played hard, and usu
ally when we play hard, we
win in conference," said Og
wumike. "And USC found a
way to out-grit us and out
hustle us in away that was
different than before."
The only thing I heard
VanDerveer say when she
was on the bus was some
thing along the lines of,
"They better not send us
back to this place," referring
to the possibility of having to
make a third trip to Seattle
for the first round of the
NCAA Tournament. The
loss, however, was a turn
around for the team late in
the season that provided a
reminder that they were not
invincible.
"If we didn't lose to USC,
I'm not sure how far we
would have made it in the
[NCAA] Tournament, quite
frankly," Ogwumike said.
"That really reorganized our
offense, and we had a huge
sense of urgency because we
knew that we were vulnera
ble to lose at any point."
Stanford bulldozed
through the first two rounds
of the tournament and re
turned to Maples for a win
against the Tar Heels, what
Ogwumike believes was the
team's most exciting and re
warding win of the season.
The seniors were able to
leave Maples for the last
time with a bang after de
feating UNC and earning a
trip to the Final Four. When
I walked in to congratulate
the team, the energy in the
locker room was electric
country music blaring and
fried chicken galore and
that same energy trans
ferred over on the trip to
Music City.
Once in Nashville, No. 2
Stanford knew it was the un
derdog going up against No.
1 Connecticut. The Cardinal
decided to take a relaxed ap
proach towards the game, fo
cusing on having fun and not
getting too tight. Stanford
finished up its open practice
the day before the Final
Four with Sara James lead
ing some of the players and
VanDerveer in a round of
line dancing. The strategy
worked somewhat because
the Cardinal came out confi
dent and poised in the first
half of play, but Connecticut
was just too good to be beat
en by anyone this year.
When Ogwumike was

pulled out of the game for
the last time wearing a Stan
ford jersey, there was almost
a collective inhalation from
the fans in the arena when
they realized that they were
saying their farewell to
Chiney Ogwumike one of
the greatest athletes in Stan
ford women's basketball his
tory and that the Cardinal
had missed out on another
national title.
"After the loss in the Fi
nal Four, Erica Payne was
bawling and I told her it was
okay," Ogwumike said. "But
she said, 'I wish we could
have done this for you.' And I
said, 'No, I wish I could have
played better for you.' It's
one of those things when the
people were just so selfless
and you have this huge sis
terhood. Playing for each
other means so much to us,
more than anything, and
that's the culture we've got
in our Stanford basketball
locker room."
The plane ride home was
not filled with disappoint
ment, but with renewed
drive and determination for
the season to come. Ogwu
mike told me at the begin
ning of the year that the win
dow of opportunity to get to
the Final Four is always
open at Stanford.
While Ogwumike and
Ruef are already preparing
for the next chapter in their
careers the WNBA
fellow seniors Sara James
and Toni Kokenis are
preparing for the first chap
ter in their non-basketball
lives. James will enroll in Co
lumbia University's nursing
program, while Kokenis will
continue her studies at Stan
ford as a co-term in sociology
while also saving time to
start a non-profit. The re
mainder of the team is about
to start spring training and
look ahead to next season.
Ogwumike praised the
freshman class this year for
the diverse skill sets that
each of them brought to the
team this year, especially Lili
Thompson, who broke into
the starting lineup before
Pac-12 play even started.
And Ogwumike still keeps
tabs on Erica McCall, her
"protege," to make sure
she's doing what she needs
to do to succeed.
"With the departure of
each senior class, people
have always had more and
more doubt ... and each year,
people have stepped up and
we've succeeded beyond
those doubts and expecta
tions, so I know they'll suc
ceed and find away," Ogwu
mike said. "People are going
to have to take on bigger
roles offensively. I'm not
worried about them. They're
very talented and they just
need to show it to the world."

Next season might be a
rebuilding period, but if the
past is any indication, Stan
ford women's basketball will
continue to remain one of the
premier programs in the na
tion.

Senior forward Chiney Ogwumike (above) impressed in her final season on the Farm, averaging
26.1 points and 12.1 rebounds per game en route to earning the Wooden Award.
At the beginning of the season,
Chiney Ogwumike told me that the
team's final goal was a national ti
tle; although the Cardinal fell
short, reaching the Final Four is a
huge milestone.
I was fortunate enough to be
the voice of Stanford women's bas

ketball for KZSU almost every
game en route to this year's Final
Four, and I was there when the
Card failed to win that elusive na
tional title.
That loss left a smudge on an
otherwise stellar season. Ogwu
mike, the 2014 John R. Wooden
National Player of the Year, might
not have gotten that championship
ring she deserved, but it was still

an incredible season.
"Our depth, and having so
many people contributing in so
many games, it made [the season]
that much more fun because every
one had that sense of urgency to
keep playing and that made each
possession that much more impor
tant," Ogwumike said. "We may
have hit some bumps in the road
but we played so hard for each oth

er in away that's different than in
the past."
The main theme of this year's
team was the need for greater con
tributions from more players,
aside from the big numbers Ogwu
mike was putting up every night.
Point guard Amber Orrange
stepped up at key moments in the
season and continued to be a
silent weapon for the Cardi
nal offense and defense, of
ten coming through when
she was needed most while
making the players around
her better with her dead-eye
passing and dribble penetra
tion.
The biggest breakout
star, though, was senior
Mikaela Ruef another
