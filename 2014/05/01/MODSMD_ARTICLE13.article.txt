the team's 310.2 innings, was
particularly effective at get
ting ahead of Saint Mary's
hitters before ultimately in
ducing several groundouts.
She finished the game with
nine groundouts to only four
flyouts, while allowing only a
single walk for the first time
this season.
On offense, Stanford's po
tent attack was kept in check
for most of the afternoon, as
Mussadi kept the Cardinal
off balance in four innings of
work. However, freshman
Kylie Sorenson provided the
difference on the scoreboard,
blasting a 2-run home run to
left field to score the Card's
only runs of the day.
The homer was the fifth
on the season for the South
ern California product, one
of 25 finalists for the inaugu
ral NFCA Freshman of the
Year Award. Sorenson now
leads Stanford in several of
fensive categories, including
batting average (.370), dou
bles (16), RBIs (41), slugging
percentage (.623) and on
base percentage (.503).
"We had a runner on, and
we had not been able to put
anything together up until
that point," Sorenson said of
her shot to left field, sur
prised that she was able to

take Mussadi deep. "I was
just trying to find a gap... hit
gap-to-gap with something
hard on the ground, because
with two strikes, I have been
popping up a lot."
Outside of Sorenson's
home run, the Cardinal were
also able to draw hits from
Erin Ashby, Cassandra
Roulund, Bessie Noll and Ty
lyn Wells. The three through
six hitters in the lineup were
particularly effective, going
a combined 4-for-ll (.364)
with a walk.
"I thought it was a gritty
win today," said head coach
John Rittman. "Madi pitched
extremely well and Kylie got
the big, timely home run for
us. Athough we committed
two errors defensively, we
made some nice plays and
worked out of some jams.
That shows signs of growth,
especially on the road
against a team that is a pret
ty darn good team."
The Cardinal return to
action on Friday night
against No. 2 UCLA (44-4,
15-3 Pac-12) in Los Angeles,
as part of Stanford's second
to-last series of the 2014 reg

also able to draw hits from
Erin Ashby, Cassandra
Roulund, Bessie Noll and Ty
lyn Wells. The three through
six hitters in the lineup were
particularly effective, going
a combined 4-for-ll (.364)
with a walk.
"I thought it was a gritty
win today," said head coach
John Rittman. "Madi pitched
extremely well and Kylie got
the big, timely home run for
us. Athough we committed
two errors defensively, we
made some nice plays and
worked out of some jams.
That shows signs of growth,
especially on the road
against a team that is a pret
ty darn good team."
