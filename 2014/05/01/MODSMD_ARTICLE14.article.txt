## THE
						COURT AND THE CONSTITUTION Law versus politics on the Supreme Court 
### 
To the extent that the American
public thinks about the
Supreme Court at all, it only
seems to do so in the context of the
one or two most divisive (and there
fore most mass-media-friendly) cas
es each year. The cases that make it
into the public's eye tend to be high
ly controversial, both in society and
among the justices, and are often
framed in partisan terms, with the
media often painting the Court as
consisting of a liberal wing (Justices
Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and
Kagan all Democratic ap
pointees), a conservative wing
(Chief Justice Roberts along with
Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito
all Republican appointees), and
Justice Kennedy, who acts as the de
ciding "swing vote."
Given this popular characteriza
tion of the Court, most people are
surprised to learn that the vast ma
jority of the Court's cases are not de
cided by a 5-4 vote. Last term, for in
stance, in which the Court decided a
number of contentious cases in
cluding, most notably, those involv
ing the constitutionality of Section 5
of the Voting Rights Act ( Shelby
County v. Holder ), the Defense of
Marriage Act ( Windsor v. United
States), California's Prop. 8
[Hoilingsworth v. Perry) and
warrantless DNA searches of ar
restees ( Maryland v. King) on
ly 29 percent of cases involved a 5-4
split, while a full 49 percent were de
cided unanimously.
Perhaps even more surprisingly,
when the Court does divide 5-4, it of
ten does so along lines that radically
depart from the stereotypical liber
al-conservative breakdown. Last
week, for instance, the Court hand
ed down two 5-4 decisions (some of
the first 5-4 decisions of the term)
that departed from the "classic" 5-4
breakdown.

The first, Navarette v. Cali
fornia, involved the question of
whether the Fourth Amendment
permits a police officer to pull a car
over for drunk driving when the of
ficer herself did not observe any
suspicious behavior, but only re
ceived an uncorroborated anony
mous tip that the car was driving er
ratically. Voting to uphold the stop
as constitutional, Justice Breyer
broke from the Court's liberal wing
and joined Chief Justice Roberts,
Justice Thomas, Justice Kennedy
and Justice Alito to form a majority
siding with the police. Meanwhile,
Justice Scalia penned a fiery dis
senting opinion, joined by Justices
Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Kagan, in
which he accused the Court of
"serv[ing] up a freedom-destroying
cocktail consisting of two parts
patent falsity."
The day after it handed down
Navarette, the Court issued its de
cision in Paroline v. United
States, a case asking how much
restitution, if any, federal law re

quires an individual convicted of
child pornography to pay to his vic
tim. Again, the Court split 5-4, and
again the lineup departed from the
ordinary liberal-conservative divide.
Justice Kennedy, in an opinion for a
majority consisting of himself, Jus
tice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, Jus
tice Alito and Justice Kagan, held
that a child pornography defendant
is required to pay for his proportion
al share of the harm that the victim
suffered as a result of the child
pornography Under Justice
Kennedy's rule, the defendant is re
quired to compensate the victim for
somewhere between zero percent
and 100 percent of the harm suf
fered, with the precise amount de
pending on the extent to which the
defendant's conduct caused the vic
tim's harm.
The four remaining justices all
dissented, but for different reasons:
Chief Justice Roberts, joined by
Justices Scalia and Thomas, read
the federal child pornography
statute as not entitling victims to
any restitution at all, while Justice
Sotomayor read that same law as re
quiring restitution for all damages
suffered by the victim, regardless of
whether the child pornography de
fendant caused that harm.
So what's going on here? Why is
a self-described law-and-order con
servative like Justice Scalia siding
with criminal defendants while Jus
tice Breyer, a Clinton-appointee of
ten described as a moderate liberal,
votes in favor of expanded crime
fighting power for the police?
There is a sharp divide in the
Court, for instance, on the question
of whether the Constitution's mean
ing should remain fixed (a position
most often associated with Justices
Scalia and Thomas) or whether its
meaning should change over time (a
position that Justices Alito and
Breyer, among others, have ex
pressed sympathy with recently).
Similarly, a number of justices have
staked out divergent positions on
whether it is more important to in
terpret the law to be coherent and
consistent (Justices Scalia and Gins
burg, for example) or to account for
the law's practical consequences
(Justices Breyer and Kennedy).
With a number of highly con
tentious constitutional cases yet to
be decided this term (e.g., the con
stitutionality of legislative prayer,
abortion clinic buffer zones, cell
phone searches and the Affordable
Care Act's contraceptive mandate)
at least a few of which are likely
to depart from the "typical" 5-4 split
this distinction between legal and
political questions is worth keeping
in mind.
