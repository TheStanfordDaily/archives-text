# OUTSIDE THE BUBBLE
## "There are no supermen" 
### James Bradbury 
Six months ago, I had the oppor
tunity to meet Ahmed Maher,
the seemingly unstoppable ac
tivist behind Egypt's April 6 Youth
Movement and the closest thing the
country's 2011 revolution had to a
guiding force. He could have given
an hour-long speech about the im
portance of democracy and the
rule of law and answered a handful
of inane questions from whichever
audience members lined up at the
microphones fastest. Or he could
have skipped us altogether, spend
ing his whole short early-Novem
ber trip to the United States talk
ing to officials or NGOs or sup
porters from the Egyptian diaspo
ra.

Instead, he spoke for ten min
utes in a small room at the Haas
Center for Public Service and then
opened up to questions from the 20
or so people in the audience. He
came on only a weekend's notice,
and I was lucky to be on the right
mailing list (SIG-friends, if you're
curious). It was a degree of close

ness I'd hoped for, but never really
expected, in the three years since
January 2011, which I spent glued
to the limited window of al-
Jazeera.

He told us why he'd come: that
a discussion with students was
more important than a discussion
with officials because his move
ment (April 6) was a student move
ment, and in any case, he'd had
enough of official duplicity and
broken promises Egyptian, yes,
but also American.

He gave us the basic narrative
of April 6. The first protests begin
ning in 2005 (two arrests) became
explicitly anti-Mubarak in 2007
and 2008 (another arrest, this time
with torture). Helping plan the
protests of January 2011. Being
called "heroes of the revolution" at
first by the post-Mubarak military
government, but then criticizing the
military, too, when it began to re
strict media and protect the old,
corrupt business establishment, of
which it was itself a part. ("At the

time, the Islamists supported the
military against us," he recalls, with
a touch of irony.)

Maher continued his narrative:
Pivoting from an independent
stance in the first round of presi
dential elections to an endorsement
of Islamist Mohammed Morsi in the
runoff, because the other candidate-
Mubarak's old prime minister,
Ahmed Shafiq was unacceptable
and a boycott was the wrong choice
for a first stab at democracy. Turn
ing against Morsi when he over
stepped his mandate (another ar
rest, in May 2013). Joining the call
for Morsi's ouster in the June 30
Tamarrod protests, then criticizing
the overreaches of the resulting in
terim government: "Again the gov
ernment has started to control the

media, and we're in square
number zero."
At times he was prescient:
"We want to be the third al
ternative besides Islamists
and the military but we
know it will be hard."
At times he was wrong: "I
don't think [army chief Abdel
Fattah al-Sisi] will even com
pete [in this spring's elec
tions], because he doesn't
need to hold the presidency in
order to run Egypt."
He told us that, maybe, a
third revolution would be all it
would take to create a free
Egypt with a lasting democ
racy, and expressed optimism
that one would be forthcom
ing— but after the meeting
he talked to a techie friend of
mine about developing a pri

vate communication tool
for the movement be
cause, for the first time
since he started using it to
—organize in 2007, the vul
nerabilities of social media
outweighed their advantages.
Facebook had become too
risky.
He was so focused on the
future of his movement and
his country that those of us
who were listening could easi
ly forget that his own future
was less certain than ever,
that his record of standing up
for his values and criticizing
government after govern
ment was bringing him more
enemies every day.
Indeed just weeks later, a
few days after he returned to
Cairo, he was indicted after
defying a draconian new
protest law implemented by
al-Sisi's interim military gov
ernment. He turned himself
in to the Cairo police —wear-
ing sunglasses, surrounded

by a crowd of hundreds,
chanting "Down, down
with military rule! I'll
unite on the priso7i wall
that army rule is shame
ful and a betrayal!" (It
rhymes in Arabic.) He was re
leased after a few hours, but
then was arrested again on
another charge of inciting
protest the protest that
gathered when he turned
himself in the first time.
While in custody awaiting tri
al, he was refused paper to
write on but managed to
sneak out a snark-filled state
ment on toilet paper, dis
paraging a government-run
"Human Rights Council" that
is anything but.
On December 22, he was
sentenced to three years in
prison, along with another co
founder of the April 6 move
ment and a supporter. These
were the first convictions
handed down under the new
protest law.
Since December, the mili
tary government has pushed
through a constitutional refer
endum (98 percent voted in fa
vor, though the Muslim Broth
erhood and April 6 both
pushed for a boycott). Field
Marshal al-Sisi has stepped
down from his official military
post and announced a presi
dential campaign that is all but
guaranteed to win, and thou
sands more activists have be
come political prisoners.
This week, the Egyptian
government attracted interna
tional condemnation again for
banning activities of the April
6 movement, sentencing 491
Muslim Brotherhood-affiliat
ed protesters to life imprison
ment and 37 to death, and re
ferring 683 additional death
penalty sentences, including
that of Brotherhood Supreme
Guide Mohamed Badie, to a
higher court for final approval.
For the moment, American
military aid to Egypt is on

hold as we attempt to exercise
what is perhaps the only re
maining bit of leverage we
have in Cairo.
Like many who have fol
lowed post-revolution Egypt
from the English-speaking
world, I turned to Bassem
Sabry a brilliant, bilingual
Egyptian journalist of unpar
alleled insight and honesty-for
information, analysis, and sol
ace after this, as after eveiy
piece of disheartening news
from the country. But the
world is cruel, and Sabiy—
one of the last prominent
Egyptians to constructively
engage with all sides in a polit
ical environment polarized al
most beyond imagining
died on Raesday, at age 31, in a
tragic accident.
He left a straightforward
policy guide for whenever the
Egyptian government decides
to begin confronting the hard
problems, rather than pushing
them further into the future,
and a personal manifesto
entitled, with typical low-key
erudition, "Eleutheria,"
Greek for "freedom"
which has been exchanged
countless times these past two
days over Egyptian social me
dia.
"I have learned that there
are no infallibly great super
men in the manner we used to
see them once from a distance
or when we were children...
And I have learned, in con
trast, that there are astound
ingly extraordinary human
beings. If you asked such indi
viduals if they could obliterate
a mountain with a spoon, they
would respond that every
thing was possible."
Ahmed Maher is such a
human being, and no one has
come closer to obliterating the
mountain of the corrupt, un
fair, and oppressive Egyptian
establishment from as modest
and unassuming a position as
him.

It will take a level of opti
mism in the face of unceasing
ly bad news that perhaps only
Bassem Sabry was really ca
pable of, but there is away
forward. The one constant in
the last three years of Egypt
ian politics is that public ex
pectations have consistently
been unreasonably high; that
each government, upon failing
to meet those expectations,
has received more blame for
the country's problems than it
deserves.

Maher, Badie and the en
tire leadership of April 6 and
the Brotherhood are in prison;
Bassem Youssef, the massive
ly popular TV host who drew
comparisons to Jon Stewart,
has seen his show suspended
yet again; and liberal icon Mo
hamed El-Baradei is in exile.
And whatever the benefits to
stability, counterterrorism
and perhaps foreign invest
ment of a Sisi presidency, no
man who spearheaded the
systematic exclusion of every
one of these liberal and pro
gressive political forces from
the Egyptian public sphere
will meet the expectations of a
country that still believes in
pluralism.
Like the Islamist Salafi al-
Nour party, which saved its
political rights by promising
not to field a presidential can
didate for the next decade,
Ahmed Maher has always
taken the long view. He knows
the contours of three years
how much can happen, and
how little can change. The
next three years will probably
bear that out yet again. But if
we are ever led by the set
backs of the hour to despair
that the light of the revolution
has gone out that not even
a candle is left burning in
Egypt there is still a torch
in Tora Prison.
