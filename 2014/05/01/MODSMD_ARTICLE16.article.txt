# OUTSIDE THE BUBBLE
## "There are no supermen" 
### James Bradbury 
Six months ago, I had the oppor
tunity to meet Ahmed Maher,
the seemingly unstoppable ac
tivist behind Egypt's April 6 Youth
Movement and the closest thing the
country's 2011 revolution had to a
guiding force. He could have given
an hour-long speech about the im
portance of democracy and the
rule of law and answered a handful
of inane questions from whichever
audience members lined up at the
microphones fastest. Or he could
have skipped us altogether, spend
ing his whole short early-Novem
ber trip to the United States talk
ing to officials or NGOs or sup
porters from the Egyptian diaspo
ra.

Instead, he spoke for ten min
utes in a small room at the Haas
Center for Public Service and then
opened up to questions from the 20
or so people in the audience. He
came on only a weekend's notice,
and I was lucky to be on the right
mailing list (SIG-friends, if you're
curious). It was a degree of close

ness I'd hoped for, but never really
expected, in the three years since
January 2011, which I spent glued
to the limited window of al-
Jazeera.

He told us why he'd come: that
a discussion with students was
more important than a discussion
with officials because his move
ment (April 6) was a student move
ment, and in any case, he'd had
enough of official duplicity and
broken promises Egyptian, yes,
but also American.

He gave us the basic narrative
of April 6. The first protests begin
ning in 2005 (two arrests) became
explicitly anti-Mubarak in 2007
and 2008 (another arrest, this time
with torture). Helping plan the
protests of January 2011. Being
called "heroes of the revolution" at
first by the post-Mubarak military
government, but then criticizing the
military, too, when it began to re
strict media and protect the old,
corrupt business establishment, of
which it was itself a part. ("At the

time, the Islamists supported the
military against us," he recalls, with
a touch of irony.)

Maher continued his narrative:
Pivoting from an independent
stance in the first round of presi
dential elections to an endorsement
of Islamist Mohammed Morsi in the
runoff, because the other candidate-
Mubarak's old prime minister,
Ahmed Shafiq was unacceptable
and a boycott was the wrong choice
for a first stab at democracy. Turn
ing against Morsi when he over
stepped his mandate (another ar
rest, in May 2013). Joining the call
for Morsi's ouster in the June 30
Tamarrod protests, then criticizing
the overreaches of the resulting in
terim government: "Again the gov
ernment has started to control the
