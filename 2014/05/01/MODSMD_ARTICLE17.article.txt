# Dear RCC...
## 
### Uttara Sivaram 
Every year, the number of computer sci
ence majors who apply to be a dorm
Residential Computer Consultant
(RCC) shrinks a little, thanks to well-mean
ing, bright-eyed and eager students like me.
We can't remember what life was like before
the Macßook Pro and the Apple-Option-Es
cape, but we wouldn't mind a single room and
the most stable yet undeserved source of in
come we'll likely receive for the next few
years.
That said, despite my psychology major,
I'm not a complete rookie when it comes to
computers I grew up in the Silicon Valley
took CS 106A and recently learned how to
embed GIFs in Gmail. However, my ability to
troubleshoot Wi-Fi connectivity is still limit
ed to opening Chrome, Googling "Hello," and
if all else fails, removing the battery. Never
theless, I owe it to my future residents to
treat this position as a learning experience
rather than a surefire way to avoid the Draw,
so I have created a "Dear RCC" column to
practice my duty as a computer consultant
and to encourage other RCCs to brainstorm
solutions to even the trickiest of problems.
My hope is that students will feel comfortable
coming to me with any and all computer-re
lated issues and hopefully strike up a good
conversation in the meantime!

Dear RCC,
My Internet isn't workinq: what should
I do???
Love,

Dear Ornery in Okada,
I'm very sorry to hear that. Indeed, my
Internet was also acting up this morning af
ter I took it into the shower with me and put
my "Norah Jones" playlist on maximum vol

ume. I ended up taking a longer than average
shower due to the slow cadence of Nor ah
Jones's singing, so when I toweled myself
and my Macßook Air off, I noticed that a few
things were awry (with my laptop I was of
course feeling gloriously refreshed). For one,
it refused to turn on, so I submerged it in rice
(brown, quinoa mix) and waited for about
three hours. After that, the Internet was
working extremely efficiently, and I was able
to order a "St. Bernards in the Alps" calen
dar before it went off Amazon Prime.
In summary, I'll receive that calendar in
two business days, which I consider a huge
personal success. I hope this helps you with
your problem! These situations can be frus
trating, but it is important to go about your
day as usual. Good luck!
Sincerely,
RCC

Dear RCC,
My last computer crashed, and I lost
everything on it how do I make sure
that it doesn't happen again?
Nervous in Narnia

Dear Nervous in Narnia,
Very sorry to hear that I'm guessing
you were playing Tetris on Marathon mode
and the entire computer overheated. When
you put yourself and your computer into such
high-stress situations, it is crucial that you
have all the lights turned off and a powerful fan
nearby for at least 24 hours, since we all know
that pausing a Tetris game on Marathon mode
is akin to taking a bathroom break in the mid
dle of the SAT and getting a 2400.
You should also start thinking more seri
ously about the kinds of information you keep
on your laptop. I print out every important
document I own, and I burn my favorite
songs onto CDs and cassette tapes. This is
not only economical, but also makes your
room look like it could belong to a famous
screenwriter or perhaps the guy from "A

Beautiful Mind," who believes he is a spy and
collects newspaper clippings. Everything
else I value is on You Tube, and that can be ac
cessed from most major computers (except
the ones in Green that only allow you to print
and look at the emergency exit diagrams).
I hope that helps. Please be sure to let
your friends know about these life hacks, be
cause I am asked about this problem far too
often, which can be a very tearful experience
(on both sides).
Sincerely,
RCC

Dear RCC,
I think I clicked on a bad link, and now
my computer has a virus. How do I get
rid of it????
Hacked at Haus Mitt

Dear Hacked at Haus Mitt,
That is serious indeed. May I ask why you
were motivated to click on said link? Indeed,
during the winter months, I thought I would
start getting fit so I would look my best in
Cabo, at Coachella, on Wilbur Field, etc.
However, I wished to do this with minimal
upper and lower body movement, so (as you
can imagine) I was having quite a difficult
time finding the right regimen. One day, a
link that promised to reveal three secret
tricks for an incredible body transformation
within one to two weeks suddenly and unex
pectedly popped up on my Twitter feed. I
happily entered my credit card information
(it was the least I could do) and waited to re
ceive these pearls of wisdom as I teetered on
the edge of my computer chair.
Alas, I should have known this was too
good to be true. Within seconds, Google
Chrome had shut down, a newer version of
iTunes began to download (not entirely a bad
thing) and all 47 of my sticky notes began dis
appearing from my desktop (which was dev
astating, as I had been working on a quite a
few springtime haikus on those notes). I also

got a call from my bank, which had been
alerted by the purchase of 400 Chia pets from
Guangdong, China.
I had been phished, as they say in certain
computing circles. The phrase was derived in
the same way that "phat" and "phabulous"
were derived from Ludacris's hit song "Phat
Rabbit." In the future, it is important to note
that sites asking for your personal informa
tion are probably not entering you into their
iPad mini raffle. We have all made that mis
take, so do not feel too foolish.
There is little you can do other than disas
sembling your computer entirely and placing
each part in a separate location. This will en
sure that the infected region of the computer
does not spread the infection to the other,
healthy parts. As your computer waits in
quarantine, try and find the silver lining to
this situation and spend time with friends,
family and the environment. Spend a few days
camping or meditating. Let your body detox
along with your infected computer. I promise
that this will only make the reunion with your
laptop more meaningful.
Hope this helps!!! Always remember: safe
ty first, especially on the Internet.
Sincerely,
RCC

I plan to maintain this correspondence in
my residence, perhaps in a weekly newsletter,
to ensure anonymity and allow my students to
speak their minds. I know I have a long road
ahead of me as do my other, more inexperi
enced RCC peers but I have no doubt that
my dedication and commitment to my resi
dents will compensate for my (few) personal
shortcomings as a computer consultant.
And if my recent midterm grade is any in
dication of how I'll do as an RCC, then a C+
isn't a bad omen.
