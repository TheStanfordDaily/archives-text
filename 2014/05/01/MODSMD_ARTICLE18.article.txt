# FARR LEADS LAX INTO TOURNEY
## 
### KRISTINA BASSI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's lacrosse
team (13-3, 7-2 MPSF) finished its
regular season last week with a
strong 18-7 victory over the Califor
nia Golden Bears. However, in order
to receive a first-round bye in the
six-team conference event, the Car
dinal needed Oregon to lose one of
their two final games. The Ducks
came through with an 11-5 loss to
first place Denver (15-1 overall, 8-0
MPSF) and fell again to Colorado
on Sunday, solidifying Oregon's No.
4 MPSF rank.
By virtue of Oregon's losses,
Stanford earned a first-round bye
in the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration Tournament and will begin
play Friday in the semifinals in
Denver. The Card will play the win
ner of today's Game 1, which pits
No. 3 seed Colorado (10-7, 6-3)
against No. 6 seed San Diego State
(7-9, 4-5).
Colorado figures to be the more
difficult of the two possible oppo
nents. Nonetheless, Stanford
recorded a convincing 13-5 win in
its last meeting with the Buffs. The
Cardinal led for the game's entire
ty, taking a season-high 40 shots,
with nine players scoring. Junior
Hannah Farr scored three, while
senior Rachel Ozer and freshman
Alex Poplawski netted two apiece.

Last time out against San Diego
State, Stanford scored 10 unan
swered goals to ultimately win 15-
10. Sophomore Lucy Dikeou and
freshman Kelsey Murray scored
three goals each to lead the offense;
Poplawski, Ozer and sophomore
midfielder Mackenzie Tesei each
added a brace. Farr had a goal and
two assists and sophomore mid
fielder Meg Lentz also found the
back of the net.
In their last regular season
game, the Cardinal defeated Cal 18-
7, using their offensive depth to
generate a strong and unpre
dictable attack. Stanford had nine
players score on a total of 35 shots.
Farr and Tesei each recorded a hat
trick, while senior midfielder Anna
Kim, Ozer, Lentz, Murray and
sophomore midfielder Paige South
mayd each scored two goals apiece.
On the defensive end, the senior
goalie Lyndsey Munoz tallied seven
saves, with classmate and back-line
stalwart Meg Lerner earning a
ground ball. Due to the strong de
fensive effort, Stanford was able to
control the lead for most of the
game.
Stanford has experienced in
credible success on the conference
level, winning eight of the past nine
MPSF tournament titles. Last year,
Amy Bokker's unit defeated Denver
7-6 in the championship game. The
tournament winner will earn an au

tomatic spot in the NCAA Tourna
ment.
The Cardinal returned 11
starters and 96 percent of its goals
from last season, when the team ad
vanced to the second round of the
NCAA Tournament for the first
time in school history. Stanford has
defeated three top-20 teams this
season: a pair of 11-10 victories over
No. 6 Notre Dame and No. 14
Georgetown, and an 8-7 triumph
against No. 11 Towson.
The key offensive players for the
Card in the MPSF Tournament will
be Farr, who has a team-best 39
draw controls to go along with 27
goals and just as many ground balls;
Ozer, who is tied with Farr for the
team lead in goals; Murray with 24
goals and 14 assists; and Poplawski,
with 23 goals. All will be pivotal if
Stanford is to come away with the
MPSF title.
Defensively, the Cardinal will
look to Lerner, who has a team-best
30 ground balls and 37 draw con
trols, and Munoz, who ties Lerner's
team-best 30 ground balls and has
80 saves. These two seniors lead the
defense and their performance
should be critical to Stanford's suc
cess during the MPSF Tournament
slate. Faceoff is at 6 p.m. tomorrow
night in Denver.

in goals (27) and was first on the squad with 39 draw controls.
The Stanford women's lacrosse
team (13-3, 7-2 MPSF) finished its
regular season last week with a
strong 18-7 victory over the Califor
nia Golden Bears. However, in order
to receive a first-round bye in the
six-team conference event, the Car
dinal needed Oregon to lose one of
their two final games. The Ducks
came through with an 11-5 loss to
first place Denver (15-1 overall, 8-0
MPSF) and fell again to Colorado
on Sunday, solidifying Oregon's No.
4 MPSF rank.
By virtue of Oregon's losses,
Stanford earned a first-round bye
in the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration Tournament and will begin
play Friday in the semifinals in
Denver. The Card will play the win
ner of today's Game 1, which pits
No. 3 seed Colorado (10-7, 6-3)
against No. 6 seed San Diego State
(7-9, 4-5).
Colorado figures to be the more
difficult of the two possible oppo
nents. Nonetheless, Stanford
recorded a convincing 13-5 win in
its last meeting with the Buffs. The
Cardinal led for the game's entire
ty, taking a season-high 40 shots,
with nine players scoring. Junior
Hannah Farr scored three, while
senior Rachel Ozer and freshman
Alex Poplawski netted two apiece.

Last time out against San Diego
State, Stanford scored 10 unan
swered goals to ultimately win 15-
10. Sophomore Lucy Dikeou and
freshman Kelsey Murray scored
three goals each to lead the offense;
Poplawski, Ozer and sophomore
midfielder Mackenzie Tesei each
added a brace. Farr had a goal and
two assists and sophomore mid
fielder Meg Lentz also found the
back of the net.
In their last regular season
game, the Cardinal defeated Cal 18-
7, using their offensive depth to
generate a strong and unpre
dictable attack. Stanford had nine
players score on a total of 35 shots.
Farr and Tesei each recorded a hat
trick, while senior midfielder Anna
Kim, Ozer, Lentz, Murray and
sophomore midfielder Paige South
mayd each scored two goals apiece.
On the defensive end, the senior
goalie Lyndsey Munoz tallied seven
saves, with classmate and back-line
stalwart Meg Lerner earning a
ground ball. Due to the strong de
fensive effort, Stanford was able to
control the lead for most of the
game.
Stanford has experienced in
credible success on the conference
level, winning eight of the past nine
MPSF tournament titles. Last year,
Amy Bokker's unit defeated Denver
7-6 in the championship game. The
tournament winner will earn an au

tomatic spot in the NCAA Tourna
ment.
The Cardinal returned 11
starters and 96 percent of its goals
from last season, when the team ad
vanced to the second round of the
NCAA Tournament for the first
time in school history. Stanford has
defeated three top-20 teams this
season: a pair of 11-10 victories over
No. 6 Notre Dame and No. 14
Georgetown, and an 8-7 triumph
against No. 11 Towson.
The key offensive players for the
Card in the MPSF Tournament will
be Farr, who has a team-best 39
draw controls to go along with 27
goals and just as many ground balls;
Ozer, who is tied with Farr for the
team lead in goals; Murray with 24
goals and 14 assists; and Poplawski,
with 23 goals. All will be pivotal if
Stanford is to come away with the
MPSF title.
Defensively, the Cardinal will
look to Lerner, who has a team-best
30 ground balls and 37 draw con
trols, and Munoz, who ties Lerner's
team-best 30 ground balls and has
80 saves. These two seniors lead the
defense and their performance
should be critical to Stanford's suc
cess during the MPSF Tournament
slate. Faceoff is at 6 p.m. tomorrow
night in Denver.
