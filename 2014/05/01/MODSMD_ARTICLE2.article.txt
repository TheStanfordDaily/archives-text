# Interest in pre-assignment rises
## Conflicting results in emails sent to students by ResEd 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
Over 950 students submitted pre
assignment applications for the 2014-
15 academic year, according to Resi
dential Education (ResEd) Assistant
Director Zac Sargeant.
This year's number marks an in
crease of more than 10 percent over
last year's figure of 876, which
Sargeant framed as a positive indica
tion of the experience students are hav
ing across Stanford's 23 themed resi
dences.
On Tuesday, however, ResEd en
countered an email communication
challenge in informing students of
them pre-assignment results. Some ap
plicants reported receiving up to three
emails pertaining to their results, often
with conflicting information.
"Of course we were concerned
when we began to hear that there were
errors with that mail merge that re
sulted in students receiving erroneous
information about their pre-assign
ment," Sargeant said. 'As soon as we
recognized the error, we corrected it
via email."
"At this time, all applicants have re
ceived the correct information from
our pre-assignment team," Sargeant
said.
