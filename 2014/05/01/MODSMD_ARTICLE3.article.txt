## 16th Senate moves into new seats Former senators express high hopes for incoming representatives 
### PETER SAMUEL MOON DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
As the 2014-15 ASSU Executives and
Undergraduate Senators settle into their
new roles, The Daily took a closer look at
the representatives who over the next
couple of months will grapple with issues
ranging from funding student groups to
campus mental health issues.
Sustained experience
The new Senate has two reelected
senators from the previous term, Ben
Holston 'l5 and John-Lancaster Finley
'l6. Holston and Finley were reelected
internally to their leadership positions as
Chair and Parliamentarian, respectively.
Both Holston and Finley listed the
strengthening of institutional knowledge
as a key tenet of their campaign plat
form, and argued that doing so would
produce benefits in reforming a bloated
funding system.
"I'm really happy with the new appro
priations committee members and that
the new Senate will come in having some
institutional knowledge," said former
senator Angela Zhang 'l6. "Despite a lot
of issues that we have faced, I believe
that we will find better ways to allocate
money and improve our funding system."
The new Senate will also receive
financial guidance from newly con
firmed ASSU assistant financial
managers Olivia Moore 'l6 and
Justine Moore 'l6, who co-au
thored an ultimately unsuccessful
effort to comprehensively overhaul
the student activities funding
process.
The twins will replace five-year
ASSU veteran Stephen Trusheim
'l3 M.S. 'l4 and will work to sup
port Frederik Groce 'l4, the new
Stanford Student Enterprises
(SSE) CEO. The twins empha
sized, however, that they do not im
mediately plan to return to pen
ning a revised funding reform bill.
"Justine is going to be focusing
on investments the ASSU has a
$l6 million endowment and we are
very excited to create some new
educational opportunities for stu
dents to get more involved in man
aging that money," Olivia Moore
said, adding that she herself would
focus more on the student group
funding aspect.
Olivia Moore framed that re
sponsibility as involving reviewing
the current services offered to
groups to see how they can be im
proved, thinking about new servic
es that can be offered and poten
tially supporting any funding re
forms that the new group of stu
dent leaders proposes.

Words from the old and new
When asked for any tips for the

incoming Senate, former Advocacy
Committee Chair Hisham Al-Falih
'l6 reiterated the importance of
knowing the role of a senator in the
Stanford community.
"The Senate doesn't do any
thing the students don't want to do
the Senate serves the students,"
Al-Falih said. "I recommend the
student body to be more involved
with the Senate, via email, attend
ing meetings, talking to senators
because this helps senators remain
accountable for what they do."
New senators expressed their
excitement in assuming their role as
public servants to the University.
"It's going to be a lot of work,
but I'm looking forward to it," said
Senator Malcolm Lizzappi 'l7. "I
hope to address the funding crisis.
I also want to address issues for
low-income communities. As an in
stitution, we provide great financial
aid but don't do much for our stu
dents beyond that."
Prior to their official swearing
in on Tuesday, the new senators
shadowed a few meetings of the
outgoing Senate. As the newly
elected senators adjusted to the
procedures and nitty-gritty aspects
of the Senate, many identified both
positive takeaways and things that
the new Senate could improve on.
"During the three meetings
that I shadowed... it really illus
trated to me how much work we
have ahead of us," said Senator Lu
ka Fatuesi 'l7. "The funding
process is incredibly complex while
being rather inflexible, and I think
that is the most immediate problem
that should be rectified. Hopefully
soon, we can work together with
student groups, Student Services

Enterprises (SSE) and the ASSU
Execs to create a funding process
that is more streamlined, effective
and will adequately fund student
groups, while also reducing the
burden students are required to
take in order to be a part of the AS
SU."
In their parting comments to
the next Senate, past senators also
noted how their time within the
ASSU contributed to their person
al development and character.
"Bottom line is that it taught me
about the person I was growing in
to," said former Senator Brianna
Brown 'l6. "I've always been pas
sionate, but putting your passion
into a particular cause is different
from being a representative of the
student body. It made me rethink
my career of choice, and who I
want to be when I leave Stanford...
I hope the next Senate has a great
experience like I did."
Holston outlined his goals for
his second term as senate chair as
commencing with a more produc
tive handover.
"This year I want Senate to do a
much better job defining our goals
at the beginning of our term so we
are able to stay on task throughout
the year," Holston said. "We are
having a six-hour transitions con
ference this weekend to ensure
that each of our senators are ready
to hit the ground running this
quarter. We will also be working on
issues regarding mental health,
student spaces on campus, connect
ing different student groups and
much more."

that should be rectified. Hopefully
soon, we can work together with
student groups, Student Services

Enterprises (SSE) and the ASSU
Execs to create a funding process
that is more streamlined, effective
and will adequately fund student
groups, while also reducing the
burden students are required to
take in order to be a part of the AS
SU."
In their parting comments to
the next Senate, past senators also
noted how their time within the
ASSU contributed to their person
al development and character.
"Bottom line is that it taught me
about the person I was growing in
to," said former Senator Brianna
Brown 'l6. "I've always been pas
sionate, but putting your passion
into a particular cause is different
from being a representative of the
student body. It made me rethink
my career of choice, and who I
want to be when I leave Stanford...
I hope the next Senate has a great
experience like I did."
Holston outlined his goals for
his second term as senate chair as
commencing with a more produc
tive handover.
"This year I want Senate to do a
much better job defining our goals
at the beginning of our term so we
are able to stay on task throughout
the year," Holston said. "We are
having a six-hour transitions con
ference this weekend to ensure
that each of our senators are ready
to hit the ground running this
quarter. We will also be working on
issues regarding mental health,
student spaces on campus, connect
ing different student groups and
much more."

On Tuesday night, the 16th Undergraduate Senate was sworn in after the final meeting of the 15th Undergraduate Senate. Both the incoming and outgoing student senators expressed high hopes for the new year.
As the 2014-15 ASSU Executives and
Undergraduate Senators settle into their
new roles, The Daily took a closer look at
the representatives who over the next
couple of months will grapple with issues
ranging from funding student groups to
campus mental health issues.
Sustained experience
The new Senate has two reelected
senators from the previous term, Ben
Holston 'l5 and John-Lancaster Finley
'l6. Holston and Finley were reelected
internally to their leadership positions as
Chair and Parliamentarian, respectively.
Both Holston and Finley listed the
strengthening of institutional knowledge
as a key tenet of their campaign plat
form, and argued that doing so would
produce benefits in reforming a bloated
funding system.
"I'm really happy with the new appro
priations committee members and that
the new Senate will come in having some
institutional knowledge," said former
senator Angela Zhang 'l6. "Despite a lot
of issues that we have faced, I believe
that we will find better ways to allocate
money and improve our funding system."
The new Senate will also receive
financial guidance from newly con
firmed ASSU assistant financial
managers Olivia Moore 'l6 and
Justine Moore 'l6, who co-au
thored an ultimately unsuccessful
effort to comprehensively overhaul
the student activities funding
process.
The twins will replace five-year
ASSU veteran Stephen Trusheim
'l3 M.S. 'l4 and will work to sup
port Frederik Groce 'l4, the new
Stanford Student Enterprises
(SSE) CEO. The twins empha
sized, however, that they do not im
mediately plan to return to pen
ning a revised funding reform bill.
"Justine is going to be focusing
on investments the ASSU has a
$l6 million endowment and we are
very excited to create some new
educational opportunities for stu
dents to get more involved in man
aging that money," Olivia Moore
said, adding that she herself would
focus more on the student group
funding aspect.
Olivia Moore framed that re
sponsibility as involving reviewing
the current services offered to
groups to see how they can be im
proved, thinking about new servic
es that can be offered and poten
tially supporting any funding re
forms that the new group of stu
dent leaders proposes.

Words from the old and new
When asked for any tips for the

incoming Senate, former Advocacy
Committee Chair Hisham Al-Falih
'l6 reiterated the importance of
knowing the role of a senator in the
Stanford community.
"The Senate doesn't do any
thing the students don't want to do
the Senate serves the students,"
Al-Falih said. "I recommend the
student body to be more involved
with the Senate, via email, attend
ing meetings, talking to senators
because this helps senators remain
accountable for what they do."
New senators expressed their
excitement in assuming their role as
public servants to the University.
"It's going to be a lot of work,
but I'm looking forward to it," said
Senator Malcolm Lizzappi 'l7. "I
hope to address the funding crisis.
I also want to address issues for
low-income communities. As an in
stitution, we provide great financial
aid but don't do much for our stu
dents beyond that."
Prior to their official swearing
in on Tuesday, the new senators
shadowed a few meetings of the
outgoing Senate. As the newly
elected senators adjusted to the
procedures and nitty-gritty aspects
of the Senate, many identified both
positive takeaways and things that
the new Senate could improve on.
"During the three meetings
that I shadowed... it really illus
trated to me how much work we
have ahead of us," said Senator Lu
ka Fatuesi 'l7. "The funding
process is incredibly complex while
being rather inflexible, and I think
that is the most immediate problem
that should be rectified. Hopefully
soon, we can work together with
student groups, Student Services

Enterprises (SSE) and the ASSU
Execs to create a funding process
that is more streamlined, effective
and will adequately fund student
groups, while also reducing the
