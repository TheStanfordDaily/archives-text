## 16th Senate moves into new seats Former senators express high hopes for incoming representatives 
### PETER SAMUEL MOON DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
As the 2014-15 ASSU Executives and
Undergraduate Senators settle into their
new roles, The Daily took a closer look at
the representatives who over the next
couple of months will grapple with issues
ranging from funding student groups to
campus mental health issues.
Sustained experience
The new Senate has two reelected
senators from the previous term, Ben
Holston 'l5 and John-Lancaster Finley
'l6. Holston and Finley were reelected
internally to their leadership positions as
Chair and Parliamentarian, respectively.
Both Holston and Finley listed the
strengthening of institutional knowledge
as a key tenet of their campaign plat
form, and argued that doing so would
produce benefits in reforming a bloated
funding system.
"I'm really happy with the new appro
priations committee members and that
the new Senate will come in having some
institutional knowledge," said former
senator Angela Zhang 'l6. "Despite a lot
of issues that we have faced, I believe
that we will find better ways to allocate
money and improve our funding system."
