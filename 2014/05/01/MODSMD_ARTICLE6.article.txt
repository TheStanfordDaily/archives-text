# STUDENT LIFE
## Freshmen reflect on their sorority rush experiences 
### SEVDE KALDIROGLU 
Approximately 38 percent of
freshmen girls took part in this
year's sorority recruitment
process, according to University
administrators. Of the 332 women
who registered, 234 received bids
and 65 withdrew.
The rush experience
The rush process features three
consecutive nights of interaction
between sisters and potential new

members (PNMs) Open House,
Skit Night and Preference Night,
all of which are weighted equally
followed by Bid Day when PNMs
are extended bids.
Lauren Philips 'l7 said that she
went into the Inter-Sorority Coun
cil rush process out of curiosity and
described the experience as "ex
hausting and anxiety-inducing," es
pecially because of the mutual
ranking system. She ultimately
concluded, however, that it was
"worth it."

Amanda Edelman 'l7, who later
joined Kappa Alpha Theta, said
that she enjoyed her rush experi
ence.
"My experience definitely isn't
indicative of the whole," Edelman
said. "I know a lot of girls didn't
have good experiences, but for me it
was actually really fun. I love meet
ing new people, and it was really
cool to finally meet a lot of upper
classmen a lot of them were re
ally nice and friendly."
Although she shared a similarly

positive experience, Julia Olson 'l7,
who later accepted a bid to Pi Beta
Phi, described the rush process as
somewhat superficial, given the
brevity of interactions mainly
five- to ten-minute conversations
between sorority members and PN-
Ms.
"It does help a lot to know peo
ple in the sororities [beforehand],
especially because you're talking
with these people for only three
days," Olson said. "It's important
to have people who already know
you and can vouch for you."
Outside perspectives
Rosie La Puma 'l7, who did not
participate in rush, said that she
observed the process through her
dorm friends, some of whom came
back from the events on the verge
of tears.
"Many were really excited and
said that all the events were really
fun, but you could definitely sense
that there were high emotional
stakes for the entire week," La
Puma said.
Some students described a neg
ative stigma associated with Greek
life.
"To be very blunt, it seems like
all they do is drink and party," said
Fatimah Alajaji 'l7.
Olson acknowledged that
drinking and partying remain a
big part of Greek life but argued
that that characterization is an in
complete one.
"It's not just going out and par
tying all the time. It's also about
bonding with the girls and doing
community service," Olson said,
citing as an example the philan
thropy events many sororities or
ganize. "[Greek life] is just away of
meeting a lot of new people and be
ing part of this really awesome
community that has a lot of
events."
Olson also noted the potential
for life-long friendships with her
sorority sisters.
However, while Deshae Jenkins
'l7 was offered a bid at the end of
the three-day process, she ulti
mately decided that sorority life
would not necessarily offer what
she wanted out of her college expe
rience.
"When I thought about being in
that community of girls for four
years, it just didn't seem like it real
ly fit me," Jenkins said. "Not to say
that the people that I met weren't

nice as much as I liked the girls
... it just didn't seem like that was
what I necessarily wanted."
"Some people say that [Greek
life] is a great way to meet new
people, and that they become your
friends for life," Alajaji said. "But I

just think that your friends for life
are the people whom you meet
through shared experiences and in
terests, as opposed to in a sorority."

Olson acknowledged that
drinking and partying remain a
big part of Greek life but argued
that that characterization is an in
complete one.
"It's not just going out and par
tying all the time. It's also about
bonding with the girls and doing
community service," Olson said,
citing as an example the philan
thropy events many sororities or
ganize. "[Greek life] is just away of
meeting a lot of new people and be
ing part of this really awesome
community that has a lot of
events."
Olson also noted the potential
for life-long friendships with her
sorority sisters.
However, while Deshae Jenkins
'l7 was offered a bid at the end of
the three-day process, she ulti
mately decided that sorority life
would not necessarily offer what
she wanted out of her college expe
rience.
"When I thought about being in
that community of girls for four
years, it just didn't seem like it real
ly fit me," Jenkins said. "Not to say
that the people that I met weren't

nice as much as I liked the girls
... it just didn't seem like that was
what I necessarily wanted."
"Some people say that [Greek
life] is a great way to meet new
people, and that they become your
friends for life," Alajaji said. "But I

just think that your friends for life
are the people whom you meet
through shared experiences and in
terests, as opposed to in a sorority."

Some students describe a negative stigma associated with Greek life,
while others speak to the benefits of joining a sorority or a fraternity on
campus in terms of performing community service and building fraternal
bonds.
