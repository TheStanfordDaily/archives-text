## INSIDE PATRICK RODGERS' DECISION TO TURN PRO 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
In the weeks and months preceding March
3, the soundtrack to Stanford golfer
Patrick Rodgers's life could have easily
been The Clash's classic hit "Should I
Stay or Should I Go." Should he stay at the
Farm, finish out his remaining collegiate eligibil
ity and have another shot an NCAA team or indi
vidual title? Or should he go and turn his atten
tion to the professional ranks and take the next
step towards a coveted spot on the PGA Tour?

With speculation ramping
up after his successful start
to the spring season, the jun
ior dispelled all of the supposi
tions and rumors that day, an
nouncing his intention to
forego his final year at Stan
ford to pursue his inevitable
pro career. Although it was ad
mittedly a difficult back-and
forth mental battle, Rodgers
hasn't let doubt or guilt creep
in, and is at peace with his de
cision one that will truly im
pact the rest of his life.
"It's played out really nice
ly," Rodgers said of his an
nouncement. "Credit to every
body around Stanford I felt
like it was a very well-executed
game plan. It followed my in
tention to put the focus right
back on the team, and our
team has played great since
then."
That they have. Since
March 3, the Card have won
three out of the four events
they've entered, including the
Pac-12 Championships this
past weekend the pro
gram's first conference title
since 1994, when current head
coach Conrad Ray '97 was a
player. Not only has the team
been on a roll, so has its leader:
Since the decision, Rodgers
has won three out of his four
starts, punctuated by his first
and only individual conference
title on Sunday A former Pac
-12 Freshman of the Year and
the current top-ranked ama
teur golfer in the world,
Rodgers has truly validated
his decision to take his game to
the next level by playing ar
guably the best golf of his life.
"It was great, like a small
weight lifted off my shoul
ders," remarked the well-spo
ken junior after making his in
tentions known. 'And I think
it's really showed with the way
I've played. I was able to focus
on playing my best golf and
helping my team win. I've been
really comfortable and at
peace with the decision."
Nobody would've blamed

him if he wasn't. Though
Rodgers knew that ultimately
he had to do what was best for
him, he also realized that his
departure, coupled with the
graduation of senior Cameron
Wilson, would leave the pro
gram with a serious talent and
experience loss. But to his
credit, the Avon, Indiana na
tive never let those thoughts
take substantial root within a
golfer's strongest weapon: the
psyche. In fact, despite the im
minent roster turnover, he's
confident as ever in the pro
gram he helped remake into a
national championship con
tender.
"We have so much young
talent on our team. It looks so
promising for the future that
I'm not concerned about how
the guys will do down the
road," Rodgers beamed.
"There's three great freshmen
that are competing hard this
year, I've gotten to know the
sophomores and juniors so
well everybody's improving
and really excited about where
the program is headed under
the guidance of Coach Ray"
Of all the voices Rodgers
heard in the process of making
his decision mom, dad and
Andrew Luck to name a fewâ€”
it was perhaps the one of his
coach that stood out among the
cacophony. Ray, a former pro
fessional golfer himself, knew
that he was in a position of in
fluence; he could have easily
told his player that he just was
n't ready yet, that he needed

another year for the simple
purpose of retaining a superb
golfer. But, according to
Rodgers, Ray took a backseat
in the shaping of the eventual
decision, yet was still a promi
nent figure in the conversation.
"We've had a tremendous
amount of conversation sur
rounding his decision," Ray
said of his superstar. "He's
been considering his plan of at
tack since last summer when
he was really playing well and
moving up the rankings. He
represented the USA in the
Walker Cup Matches and had
success. Over the last 12
months, he's really done a
great job of separating himself
from his peers as the guy to
beat."
"Obviously, [Ray] has a pro
gram to maintain and a team
to build, but he's always looked
after my best interests,"
Rodgers added.
The bottom line is that
those interests, from the be
ginning, always involved pro
fessional golf. Rodgers said
that he considered leaving af
ter his freshman and sopho
more years, naively thinking
he had it all figured out. Com
peting on the PGA Tour during
the past two summers gave
him a taste of his destined pro
fession. He was tantalizingly
close to realizing his dream,
but he also felt he had a score
to settle in the collegiate ranks
first.
"I entertained the idea of
turning pro and not coming

back for my junior year, but I
really felt like Stanford was
the best place for me to contin
ue to grow and get better,"
Rodgers said. 'After this year I
felt like I was really ready to
play at that level, and I felt like
we had a great team that had
the opportunity to do some re
ally neat things. I felt like I
owed it to Coach Ray and my
teammates here to not leave
any unfinished business."
Indeed, after watching his
squad finish T-19th at the
NCAA Championships his
freshman year and then not
even qualifying for the nation
al tournament last season, it
easy to see why Rodgers be
lieves "we've underachieved a
little bit" in his time at Stan
ford. He's out to change that,
and a dominating victory in the
desert to capture the elusive
Pac-12 crown is certainly the
first step on what he hopes is a
long journey culminating in
trophy hoisting in Hutchinson,
Kansas.
"We're one of the teams
that could be in the mix at
NCAAs," Rodgers comment
ed. 'All my focus is on the team
golf, but I'm really excited
about how everything hap
pened, and I'm really happy to
have the support of Coach Ray
and the Stanford Athletics
family It's been an awesome
experience."
And it's not over yet.
