# PONDERING PATRICK
## INSIDE PATRICK RODGERS' DECISION TO TURN PRO 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR

3, the soundtrack to Stanford golfer
Patrick Rodgers's life could have easily
been The Clash's classic hit "Should I
Stay or Should I Go." Should he stay at the

ity and have another shot an NCAA team or indi
vidual title? Or should he go and turn his atten
tion to the professional ranks and take the next
step towards a coveted spot on the PGA Tour?
