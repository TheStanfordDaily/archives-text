## Stanford faces champs Card aim to make statement at UCLA 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN DESK EDITOR 
Without a doubt, it's been a year
of growth for Stanford baseball (19-
19, 7-11 Pac-12), and the upcoming
month of May could provide a show
case of just how far the team has
come as it prepares to make a des
perate push towards the postsea
son.
While the team has had its fan
share of defensive struggles, incon
sistent pitching and long stretches
of silent bats, the Cardinal are still
in the picture and have done a re
spectable job of rebuilding after the
losses of Mark Appel 'l3, Austin
Wilson 'l3 and Brian Ragira 'l3.
Now, it's time to see if the Cardinal
can rally behind their combination
of talented youth and experienced
veterans and make a run when they
take on the UCLA Bruins (22-19-1,
9-9) for a three-game series begin
ning in Los Angeles on Friday.
UCLA, the defending NCAA
champion, has taken a step back in
the Pac-12 pecking order this sea
son, currently sitting at sixth place
in the conference standings two
spots (and two games) ahead of the
Card. The Bruins have also strug
gled a bit in the past week, being
swept at home by crosstown rival
USC and playing UC-Santa Bar
bara to a 5-5 tie on TUesday after the
game was called due to darkness in
the 12th inning.
For the first game of the series,
UCLA will likely send out Friday
starter James Kaprielian (5-4).
Kaprelian, a sophomore right-han
der, has done a solid job for most of
the season to the tune of a 2.53
ERA, but he gave up 5 runs in 6.2 in
nings in the Bruins' 10-0 loss to
USC last week.
In game two, expect the Bruins

to send out their number-two man,
junior lefty Grant Watson (4-6).
Watson started off the season
strongly but has lost his last three
starts, so the Card will look to take
advantage of his slump in the sec
ond leg of the series.
Sophomore righty Cody Poteet
(3-2) will more than likely take the

mound for game three of the series.
Poteet has put up good numbers this
season with three wins and a 3.83
ERA, but he will have his work cut
out for him on Sunday as he will
likely take on Stanford's scorching
hot number-three pitcher, John
Hochstatter (6-1). Hochstatter, a
junior lefty, took over the third

starting spot from freshman Chris
Viall and has dazzled in his new role,
posting a team-best 1.93 ERA and
keeping the Card's postseason
hopes alive by leading the team to
its lone win against Cal in the sec
ond game of last weekend's series.
Aside from Hochstatter, fresh
men righties Brett Hanewich (1-4)
and Cal Quantrill (3-4) will pitch
games one and two of the series, re
spectively. Although they don't have
the wins to prove it, Hanewich and
Quantrill have both shown a tremen
dous amount of talent and compo
sure as first-year starters and Stan
ford head coach Mark Marquess will
be counting on his pair of freshman
phenoms to get the job done in a cru
cial series against the Bruins.
The biggest challenge to Stan
ford's pitchers will come from soph
omore outfielder Ty Moore and jun
ior catcher Shane Zeile, who typical
ly bat back-to-back in the order. For
Stanford's hurlers, it will be ex
tremely important to keep runners
off base ahead of UCLA's murder
ers' row of Moore and Zeile, who
have 20 and 21 RBIs, respectively.
In the other dugout, the Card
have received a huge offensive lift
from freshman second baseman
Tommy Edman in the last week.
Edman brings a nine-game hitting
streak with him down to Los Ange
les and will look to keep comple

menting Austin Slater and Alex
Blandino and putting runs on the
board for the Card.
Edman's recent surge marks the
second time this season that a first
year hitter has stepped up for Stan
ford, as Edman followed the lead
that Alex Dunlap set back in March.
The impressive performances from
Stanford's youth have been vital to
keeping the Cardinal's postseason
hopes alive and should provide the
program with a good deal of confi
dence heading into the future.
Stanford will look for its talented
youngsters to step up and cast aside
their spell of inconsistency at Jackie
Robinson Field against the Bruins.
Although a series sweep is not ab
solutely necessary, Stanford cannot
afford to drop more than two games
on this road trip. The fate of Stan
ford's season will depend a lot on
this upcoming series, and Cardinal
fans will soon see if this talented but
shaky squad can finally put a run to
gether.
First pitch from Jackie Robinson
Field is scheduled for 6 p.m. on Fri
day. Saturday's game is set for 7
p.m. and will be televised nationally
on ESPNU. The final game of the
series is set to begin at 1 p.m. on
Sunday.

Junior lefty John Hochstatter (above) has been dynamite for Stanford
this year. Hochstatter cracked the rotation and has compiled a 6-1
record, which he'll look to improve upon at UCLA this weekend.
