## Stanford faces champs Card aim to make statement at UCLA 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN DESK EDITOR 
Without a doubt, it's been a year
of growth for Stanford baseball (19-
19, 7-11 Pac-12), and the upcoming
month of May could provide a show
case of just how far the team has
come as it prepares to make a des
perate push towards the postsea
son.
While the team has had its fan
share of defensive struggles, incon
sistent pitching and long stretches
of silent bats, the Cardinal are still
in the picture and have done a re
spectable job of rebuilding after the
losses of Mark Appel 'l3, Austin
