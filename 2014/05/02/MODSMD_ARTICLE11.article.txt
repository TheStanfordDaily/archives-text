## Playoff hopes on the ropes Cardinal travel to meet No. 2 Bruins 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
The Pac-12 Conference in soft
ball is one of the toughest draws in
collegiate athletics this season, fea
turing five top-15 teams, including
the No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 teams in
the nation. Unfortunately for the
Cardinal (28-21, 3-15 Pac-12), the
gauntlet at the back end of their
schedule matches them up against
the toughest of their conference
competition in consecutive series, as
Stanford will take to the road and
visit No. 2 UCLA (44-4,15-3) just a
week after suffering a sweep at the
hands of No. 1 Oregon.
