## Playoff hopes on the ropes Cardinal travel to meet No. 2 Bruins 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
The Pac-12 Conference in soft
ball is one of the toughest draws in
collegiate athletics this season, fea
turing five top-15 teams, including
the No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 teams in
the nation. Unfortunately for the
Cardinal (28-21, 3-15 Pac-12), the
gauntlet at the back end of their
schedule matches them up against
the toughest of their conference
competition in consecutive series, as
Stanford will take to the road and
visit No. 2 UCLA (44-4,15-3) just a
week after suffering a sweep at the
hands of No. 1 Oregon.
Stanford is still seeking its first
conference series win of the season
and sits in eighth place in the nine
team conference, ahead of just Ore
gon State. However, things are look
ing bleak this weekend for the Car
dinal, which have only claimed one
victory over teams ranked in the top
15 this season in 13 tries. Mean
while, the powerful Bruins have on
ly lost this year 1 to teams ranked in
the top five.
The Cardinal are coming off of a
hard-fought 2-1 non-conference win
over St. Mary's to kick off their final

road trip of its season, while UCLA
is fresh off of a sweep of Cal and is
riding an 11-game winning streak
coming into the matchup.
UCLA brings a remarkably bal
anced team to the table, with both
its offense and pitching staff
ranked in the top 15 in the nation.
Bruins pitchers have combined for
a 1.73 ERA this season and have
held opposing hitters to a com
bined .202 batting average, and
will look to stifle a Stanford offense
that has struggled as of late, with
only five runs scored in its last four
contests.

The Bruins pitching staff is led
by a two-pronged attack in junior-
Ally Carda and senior Jessica Hall,
who both own sub-2.00 ERAs and
have combined to strike out over

31 percent of the batters that they
have faced this season. If Stanford
will be looking to emerge from
southern California with a series
win, it will need its offense to step
up in a big way to give a Cardinal
pitching staff that has been shaky
at times this season the run sup
port that it will undoubtedly need.
The UCLA offense is hitting
.337 as a unit and is ranked ninth in
the country in that metric, giving
freshman pitcher Madi Schreyer a
lot to think about heading into this
weekend. Schreyer has been a stal
wart in the circle all season for the
Cardinal to the tune of a 3.34 ERA
and 161 strikeouts, but she'll need to
dig deep to quiet down the Bruins'
offense after struggling against
Oregon in last weekend's series.

UCLA boasts nine hitters on its
roster with averages over .300 and
is led by sophomore infielder Mysha
Sataraka, who is hitting a tremen
dous .355 with 15 home runs and 47
RBIs on the season. She is backed
up in a deep lineup by junior
Stephany La√üosa, who is hitting
.398 with 12 home runs and 40 RBIs.
Six Bruins hitters have hit five or
more home runs this season, while
eight have driven in 20 or more
runs.
After the tall order against

UCLA over the weekend, Stanford
will return home to face conference
cellar-dweller Oregon State in its fi
nal series of the season.
Friday's game against UCLA
will start at 7 p.m. and will be tele
vised on the Pac-12 Networks, Sat
urday's game will start at 3 p.m. and
can be viewed on ESPNU and Sun
day's series finale will start at noon
and will be televised on ESPN.

Erin Ashby (above) and the Cardinal will be hard-pressed to score
against a Bruins pitching staff that is among the nation's best, having
posted a 1.73 ERA and allowing an opposing batting average of just .202.
