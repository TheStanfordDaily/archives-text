## OP-ED Walking the talk on supporting transgender students 
### Violet Trachtenberg 
We are extremely lucky to go
to school on a campus
where the majority of stu
dents don't outright hate transgen
der and genderqueer people.
A brief refresher: A transgen
der person is someone whose gen
der identity does not correspond
with the sex they were assigned at
birth. For example, a transgender
woman might have been assigned
"male" at birth but she identifies as
a woman. "Genderqueer" and
"non-binary" are terms to describe
people who identify somewhere in
between the male/female gender
binary, or outside of that binary en
tirely. I use "trans" as an inclusive
term to include both transgender
and genderqueer/non-binary peo
ple. (Note also that there are differ
ent language and frameworks for
gender nonconformity in non-West
ern cultures.)
It is highly likely that you, the
reader of this article, hold socially
liberal views when it comes to trans
issues. Or, perhaps you're ambiva
lent, but you generally believe that
gender is complicated (duh!) and
people should be able to manifest
their identities with integrity and
authenticity.
Unfortunately, there is a mis
match between these positive atti
tudes towards trans students and
Stanford community members'
skills and knowledge for actively
supporting their trans peers.
If you care about ending the
marginalization and ostracization of
trans students at Stanford, it is time
to both talk the talk and start walk
ing the walk. Below is a list of "calls
to action" for making a better com
munity for our trans classmates.
Some of these suggestions may
seem hard, time-consuming or un
necessary, but we the organizers
of Transgender Awareness Week
ask that you return to this list, in
ternalize some of these ideas and
ask yourself how you might change
your everyday practices to make
our community more accepting.
♦ ♦♦
1) When doing introductions for a
student group, a class, a dinner, a
dorm and similar settings, ask peo
ple to state their preferred gender
pronouns. For example: "Welcome
to your CS 106A section! Let's go
around and say our names, pre
ferred gender pronouns and major."
This gives an opportunity for trans
students to clarify what pronouns
they like to go by, so that they can
avoid being misgendered (called the
wrong gender).
Do not only ask if you think trans
people are in the room; this should
become a normalized practice in all
Stanford spaces. Another reason
this is an important practice is be
cause you cannot know someone's
gender by looking at them. By al
ways asking for preferred gender
pronouns we begin to destabilize
the notion that we can assume peo
ple's gender identities.
2) Make, or find online, gender-in
clusive bathroom signs for all of
your events (also known as gender
neutral bathrooms). For many trans
people, bathrooms are a source of
anxiety and potential harassment
or violence. Imagine: There is an
event you really want to go to all
of your friends are going but you
don't know if you will have a safe
space to go to the bathroom. This is
really quite simple: If you don't
want to marginalize trans people,
you should be making, printing and
posting gender-inclusive bathroom
signs for every single event.
If you have fears or doubts about
the safety or necessity of gender
neutral bathrooms, there are many
resources online to read. If you feel
the need to ask ahead of time, Stan
ford spaces should be flexible in giv
ing you permission to post the signs.
3) Teach yourself about
"they/them" pronouns. Many trans
and genderqueer people, including
many of your classmates at Stan
ford, prefer to be referred to as
"they/them" instead of "he/him" or
"she/her." This is Stanford, so I
know some grammar buffs are
cringing in their seats right now.
Time to start getting those cringes
out of your system and remember
that gender is a complex social con
struct that won't always fit into cur
rently prescribed rules of gram
mar. Make the effort to accept and
affirm your classmates' identities
by using they/them, even if it is dif
ficult at first.

This is another reason why it is
important to ask for people's pre
ferred gender pronouns how do

you expect to look at someone and
know whether they use they/them?
4) Notice whenever there is a con
versation about "gay and lesbian" is
sues, marriage, oppression, discrim
ination, representation, etc. that
does not include specific discussion
of trans people. Discrimination on
the basis of sexual orientation is a
very real and horrible reality; re
member that discrimination on the
basis of gender identity is far more
pervasive, un-checked and violent.
5) Never, never, NEVER ask trans
or genderqueer people about their
medical or legal transition this
includes asking about hormone
therapy, surgery or their plans for
medical treatment. I know you're
curious but ask yourself why
you are curious. Why is it so impor
tant to know someone's genital
make-up? For example, if you know
the person in front of you is a trans
woman and wants to be known and
recognized by the world as a
woman, then her genitalia is 100
percent irrelevant. On this topic,
actress and activist Laverne Cox
from the TV show Orange is the
New Black says: "The preoccupa
tion with transition and surgery ob
jectifies trans people." To hear
more from Laverne, check out her
lecture at Cemex on May Bth.
If you are asking a trans person
about their transition, it should be
because you are already in a sup
portive friendship with them or
they have chosen to share with you.
Not because you are curious, or
want to learn from their experi
ence. By the same measure, if
someone does share private details
with you, don't casually repeat
them to others.
6) Be precise about the language
you use. A transgender woman was
not "born a boy" she has always
been a woman, but was "assigned
male at birth." Always remember
that a "trans man" is someone who
identifies as (and therefore is) a
man, and a "trans woman" is some
one who identifies as and is a
woman not the other way
around. "Tranny" is a pejorative
and violent word that should never
be spoken at Stanford; I write it
here in the hopes that readers now
know to never use it. If you refer to
groups as "boys and girls" or
"ladies and gentlemen," you are ex
cluding non-binary trans people.
Remember, what we consider ac
ceptable language is constantly
changing this means you need to
constantly be educating yourself.
♦ ♦♦
This is an incomplete list, but it's
a stai*t. It might feel like a lot. But
we think all students no matter
their gender identity deserve to
attend a university that accepts, af
firms and supports their identities.
We think all students deserve to at
tend a university that is actively try
ing to improve its ability to accept,
affirm, and support students.
Do you?
