# Tied up by responsibilities
## 
### Lily Zheng 
Tresidder seemed far away, but
it was nighttime and I could
see the lights shining through
the sprinkling of rain all around me
except everything was upside
down.
My view spun slowly and I wig
gled my fingers to check that I could
still feel everything; then the spin
ning stopped. I blinked the rain out
of my eyes and squinted at my rigger,
who thoughtfully adjusted a knot be
fore walking back to his camera and
grinning at me. "Smile," he said, and
took the picture.
It's been almost two months
since I was tied upside-down in
White Plaza for that quick photo
shoot, and since then, rope hasn't
gotten any less exciting. Not just
rope, to be honest the leather
cuffs in my third desk drawer and
even my corset (that counts as
bondage too, you know) are some of
my favorite accessories.
Statistics on BDSM are flaky,
sensationalist and not always true
but when you read multiple sto
ries talking about "40 percent of
couples trying light bondage in the
bedroom" or "more than 33 percent
of women having experience with
bondage," the exact numbers don't
matter. Bondage is relevant! For
some reason, when it's agreed upon
and wanted by both partners, bind
ing your partner's hands or pinning

them to the bed is hot!
And bondage is more than just
erotic —my friends and partners
see bondage as sensation play, as a
willful giving and taking of control,
as art, as a thrill. When I look back
at pictures of myself tied up in red
spiderwebs of rope, I remember the
snugness of the sensations on my
body (it's pretty comfortable when
you do it right!), the feeling of being
told to struggle and straining
against the firmly tied knots. Most
of all, though, I'm mesmerized by
how beautiful it looks. One of the
most vivid experiences I can re
member is having rope tied around
me in a full-body harness, unable to
move anything but my fingers, and
suddenly being weightless, lifted off
the ground, suspended by nothing
but the tightness of the rope that
sprawled out on my body. It was
magical.
Here at Stanford, it's a bit hard
er to do things like rope suspension
or full-body bondage without people
asking you what you're doing (Hint:
Tell them it's art and they'll go
away) —so there's a tendency to
stick to the lighter stuff, to just
handcuffs and collars and pushing
them up against your closet while
you're throwing your clothing off
faster than nudists coming back
from a business meeting. And that's
awesome, but there's more to it!

But as with everything else
that's kinky, whether you use cuffs
or full-body latex suits, it's not
bondage until it's consensual. It's
not bondage until it's safe.
When my wrists are bound for a
scene, my play partner makes sure
to check in every ten minutes or so,
squeezing the tips of my fingers
briefly to make sure I can still feel
their touch. That's their responsibil
ity, and mine too to remind them if
they forget. If a body part falls
asleep or starts getting that pins
and-needles feeling, it's my job to
speak up; if it starts feeling more
uncomfortable than I would like, it's
my job to let my play partner know.
Every rigger has a pair of shears to
cut rope in an emergency, and any
bondage toy or device has some way
for it to get taken off in an emer
gency.
Kink is most fun when it's safe!
Bondage sits on the boundary
between "kinky things that people
are hesitant to even think about"
and "totally normal for intimacy,"
and for that reason, it's so much
more important that people do it
safely. When two people decide to
try handcuffs or rope or bondage,
it's usually without the thought of
"oh, this is kink better think
about safety!" and those people are
at a much higher risk of potential
danger. There's the often-repeated
story for instance, of the one guy
that handcuffed himself alone in his
room and lost the key and starved
to death that's a morbid example
of people not understanding kink
for what it actually is.
Kink is like bungee-jumping,
skydiving, baseball, running
marathons, sex: It can be infinitely
thrilling, amazing and satisfying
that is, if you know what you're do
ing. You wouldn't jump out of a
plane without a parachute, play
baseball without a helmet, run a
marathon with no experience run
ning. Kink is no different.
Take a class! Browse the Inter
net! Meet some people who have
some experience, learn how to tie
knots and what handcuffs are the
most comfortable; learn how to
clean your rope, try on different
toys like you try on safewords and
figure out what you want out of
bondage.
And once you finish doing that
don't forget to wink when you
tell curious people that it's just art.
