# SPORTS BRIEF
## Golfers Stackhouse, Kim and Danielson named to All-Pac-12 Teams 
### â€“ Cameron Miller 
For the second consecutive sea
son, Stanford sophomore golfer
Mariah Stackhouse was named to
the All-Pac-12 First Team, the con
ference announced Thursday.
The Riverdale, Georgia, native,
who was also named to the 2014
Curtis Cup team in March, was the
only Cardinal player to receive
first-team honors. Stackhouse fol
lowed up her impressive freshman
campaign with a solid sophomore
season, winning the Edean Ih
lanfeldt Invitational in early Octo
ber and the UC-Irvine Invitational
in February. And though she wasn't
able improve upon her top-three
finish at last year's Pac-12 Tourna
ment at this season's conference
event, Stackhouse still placed in a
tie for ninth to lead her young
squad to a long-awaited title.
Also for the second straight
year, Stackhouse's classmate Lau
ren Kim was named to the All-Pac
-12 Second Team. Kim made huge
strides in her second year on the
Farm, and is currently ranked
amongst the top 70 female amateur
golfers in the world.
The local product has led or co
led her team four times this season,
including at this past weekend's
Pac-12 Championships. Kim tied
for ninth place along with Stack
house and teammate Casey Daniel
son, proving that her contributions
to the unit cannot be overlooked.
Her best numerical performance of
the season to date came at the San
Diego State Farms Invitational, at
which she fired a cumulative 6-un
der 210 score to finish second.

Rounding out Stanford's golfers
on the All-Pae-12 teams was
Danielson, who earned honorable
mention. Danielson stepped up her
level of play immensely during the
Card's spring schedule, and was
the team's lowest scorer in four of
its last six events. A four-time indi
vidual state champion in her home
state of Wisconsin, Danielson has

provided the Cardinal with the con
sistent third punch it lacked
throughout much of last season.
Her best event of the year also
came in San Diego, where she
placed one stroke back of Kim with
a 5-under 211.
Also this week, Stanford was as

signed to the NCAA East Regional
in Tallahassee, Florida. Anne Walk
er's squad will enter the regional as
the No. 3 seed and will begin play at
the South Wood Golf Club next Fri
day.
