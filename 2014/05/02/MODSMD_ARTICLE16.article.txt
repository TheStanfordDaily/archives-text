## Jake Shimabukuro The 						unexpected virtuoso plays the ukelele 
### AARON SEKHRI 
The word "virtuoso" is not usually
preceded by "ukulele," but that's
always been Jake Shimabukuro's
advantage. "The best thing about
being a touring ukulele player," he
said, "is that audiences have such
low expectations."
"Which is great," he added, with a
laugh.
Shimabukuro delivered an exception
al performance on April 24 at a sold-out
Bing Concert Hall, his first time back on
The Farm in ten years. He mostly played
originals but included some of the covers
that introduced him to a popular audience.
When Shimabukuro was introduced
by Stephen Sano M.A. '9l DMA '94, di
rector of choral studies at Stanford and a
friend and mentor to Shimabukuro, he

was praised for his love of the instrument,
of music, his energy, and his intellect.
Sano described the sessions Shimabukuro
had held with students before the con
cert, and complimented him on his
thoughtfulness and the way in which he
approached making and playing music.
Shimabukuro's performances ranged
in style and energy. For some pieces, he
channeled his inner rock-star, jumping
and bouncing around the carpeted stage.
For others, he stood, fixated, evoking so
much more emotion than one could imag
ine possible from such a simple instru
ment. The simplicity of the instrument
and his fast finger-work created an effect
that was as unlikely as it was moving. He
played a number of intricate, complex
melodies, typified by his rendition of
Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody," which he
famously played in a 2010 TED perform

ance, as well as his cover of The Beatles'
"While My Guitar Gently Weeps".
Shimabukuro's dynamism, sincerity
and versatility were all on show last week,
and it was truly something to see him go
from one song to the other, the first burst
ing with enthusiasm and the second in
voking a somber melancholy. He some
times enlisted the help of a bassist, Rich
Glass, to add to his performance. For one
song, he even used effect pedals to trans
form the ukulele into an electric guitar.
For another, he used the pedals to record
and loop a song to great effect.
On several occasions, Shimabukuro
stopped to speak to the audience about
his background and his instrument. He
said that he fell in love with the ukulele at
an early age - he first got his hands on the

instrument at age four, and he has
n't let go since.
"You'd have to pry it out of my
hands for me to eat dinner and do
my homework," he joked to the au
dience.
He described the inspiration be
hind many of his most famous
works, often moments shared with
family and friends. "Blue Roses
Falling" was inspired by stories told
to him by the ill grandmother of a
friend of his, who saw hallucinations
of blue rose petals falling at night
above her as she lay on a hospital
bed. Another song, "Gentle Man
dolin," which he dedicated to his
son, was inspired by his love of the
mandolin and its special chord voic
ing. He joked that he had to really
stretch his fingers to do the piece
justice, but he managed just fine.
Shimabukuro gushed about the
venue, speaking multiple times mid
performance to thank the Bing fam
ily for having made it all possible.
Speaking directly to Helen Bing,
who was in attendance, he thanked
her, saying that, "we'd be looking at
the stars if it weren't for her". He
dedicated his encore to Mrs. Bing,
playing a beautiful rendition of
"Somewhere Over The Rainbow"
from "The Wizard of Oz".
That was also the only song
Shimabukuro played acoustically, on
a ukulele that was specially commis
sioned by Sano. It was made with the
leftover cedar from the construction
of the Bing Concert Hall stage. His
own ukulele was made by Kamaka
Ukulele, a premier Hawaiian ukulele
manufacturer (and a favorite of
Shimabukuro and George Harrison).
Shimabukuro also described his
relative good fortune for his ability
to play the instrument professional
ly, and internationally.
"Back then there weren't many
touring ukulele players," he re
called. "In my wildest dreams I did
n't think I'd be doing this."
