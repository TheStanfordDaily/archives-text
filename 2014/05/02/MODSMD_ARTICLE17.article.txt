## Watkins' visions of the West 
### DEWITT CHENG 
The 20th-century landscape photo
graphs of the American West by
Ansel Adams and Edward Weston
may now be so familiar that we
take them for granted, but almost
a century before them, there was
Carleton Watkins, whose grand vision of
the West helped shape theirs.

"Carleton Watkins: The Stanford Al
bums," currently on view at the Cantor
Arts Center, features 85 vintage prints,
beautifully framed and installed, and in
superb condition. They have been kept
unbound in oversized albums by their
owners, and subsequently archived in
Stanford University Library's Special Col
lections Department until now.

A native New Yorker who came to
San Francisco in 1851 in pursuit of gold,
the young Watkins found his calling in
photography — a new medium at the
time, born about the same time as the
'photographicist,' to use the artist/busi
nessman's term by accident. Watkins
would mine images rather than gold
dust, producing, over 50-odd years, al
most 10,000 photographs — repro
duced in stereo cards and books of mam
moth 18-by-22-inch plates-of the devel
oping West. These iconic images, com
bining stunning topographic details and

panoramic sweep, dazzled the world,
winning Watkins international acclaim
and, for a time, financial success.
The landscape painters Albert Bier
stadt, Thomas Hill and William Keith
knew Watkins and his work; the tran
scendentalist philosopher Ralph Waldo
Emerson declared that Watkins' photos
had proved giant sequoias no myth. The
New York Times praised the images as
"indescribably unique and beautiful."
The impact was not confined to artists
and writers, however. Watkins' 1861
photos of Yosemite were instrumental in
aiding the passage of the 1864 Yosemite
Grant Act exactly 150 years ago, preserv
ing spectacular wilderness from develop
ment and setting a precedent for the lat
er national parks system.
Where Adams and Weston present
lyrical, even Romantic views of pristine
nature, Watkins seems more realistic and
modern. His photographs, commis
sioned by mining, ranching, manufactur
ing and railroad interests, were in fact
admitted as documentary evidence in
court cases, reportage without editorial
izing, despite their sterling aesthetic
qualities.

The Cantor exhibition features 85
of the 156 prints that Watkins made in

three albums for collector Mary "Mollie"
Latham, wife of the banker who defeat
ed Leland Stanford in California's 1860
gubernatorial race. She later sold them
to railroad magnate Mark Hopkins,
whose son later bequeathed them to
Stanford. Photos of her magnificent man
sion help viewers imagine how Gilded
Age aristocrats might have viewed "Pho
tographs of the Yosemite Valley" (1861
and 1865-6), "Photographs of the Pacific
Coast" (1872-6), and "Photographs of
the Columbia River and Oregon" (1871).
The photographs are grouped by lo
cation, as Watkins presented them. Dif
ferent works will resonate with different
viewers, but the incredible detail cap
tured in these large, 18-by-22-inch pho
tos will impress even art mavens used to
huge digital blowups.
We should also remember the hero
ic efforts needed in the mid-19th centu
ry to capture these images. The cumber

salts and egg-white albumen and heavy
glass plates that were treated in the field
with acids, ether, alcohol and silver ni
trate. Watkins hauled 2,000 pounds of
