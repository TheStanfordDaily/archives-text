## Friendship takes center stage at Bing 
### FIONA NOONAN 
When Mandy Patinkin and Patti LuPone opened
"Evita" together on Broadway in 1979, they
not only launched their stage careers and
captured audiences' hearts, but they also
became lifelong friends. On Saturday
evening, in front of a sold-out Bing Concert
Hall, they enraptured audiences once more, celebrat
ing their 35 years of friendship in "An Evening with
Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin."
For most students, Patinkin is probably best
known as Saul Berenson from Showtime's "Home
land," or as the ever-quotable Inigo Montoya of "The
Princess Bride." LuPone, the original Fantine from
"Les Miserables," may be most recognizable at Stan
ford from her recent cameo on HBO's "Girls". Howev
er, neither of their respective histories on screen
came into play on Saturday. Instead, the evening was
dedicated to duets and solos from some of LuPone's
and Patinkin's most famous musical performances.
They opened the evening with two Stephen
Sondheim numbers before launching into a set from
Rodgers and Hammerstein's "South Pacific," when the
magic of the performance began in earnest. As
Patinkin and LuPone stood together at the center of
the sparsely decorated Bing stage and began "Some
Enchanted Evening," the atmosphere of the auditori
um changed dramatically.
At 65, LuPone still has it, and Patinkin's deep, rich
voice complemented hers beautifully; although they
were accompanied by a piano and bass, LuPone and
Patinkin were in their own world on stage, and invited
audiences in to glimpse the joy they shared with each
other. By the end of the song, some of the audience
was in tears, setting the tone for what would be an
evening that spanned an emotional spectrum from the
euphoria of love to the sadness of loss and rejection.
Few pairs could achieve such a remarkable emotional
swing with little more than the loose ties of musical
theater pieces and no set or supporting cast to rely on.
In the first act, LuPone and Patinkin's commit
ment to their roles dominated the show, but by the
second half of the evening, they opened up to the au
dience, letting us in on the friendship they had cher
ished for so long. The two behemoths of musical the
ater became more real, joking with each other and
even having to redo their post-intermission entrance
after timing it incorrectly the first time. Of course,
the moment everyone in attendance had hoped for
were renditions of Patinkin and LuPone's signature
songs from "Evita", and "Don't Cry for Me Argentina"
and "Oh, What a Circus" high
lighted the night.

However, what came just be
fore those two powerhouse per
formances may have been the
most emotional and beautiful part
of the whole show. In introducing
their songs from "Evita," LuPone
and Patinkin shared the story of
how they met. As Patinkin told it,
he had been taken by LuPone
from the start, but the critical mo
ment for their friendship oc
curred on one of the first per
formances of "Evita," when he
found LuPone crying in her dress
ing room during an intermission
and forced his way in to comfort
her.

"I told her I was not leaving
the room until she understood

that she had a friend for life," he
said, to an audience so silent that
shuffling feet became distracting.
Smiling warmly at LuPone, he re
counted taking her in his arms
and holding her tight.
"I did not let go then, or
ever," Patinkin said.
More than the music, which
was, itself, incredible, the night
was about love, loyalty and friend
ship. And if the raucous standing
ovation that LuPone and Patinkin
received at the end is any indica
tion, the people present to wit
ness their friendship will not let
go of the performance for a long
time to come.
