## "Fantasticks" has simple charm 
### SOPHIA DAO 
When nighttime jubilees pass and come undone,
how do happy endings appear in the sun? Di
rected by Ken Savage 'l4, the 1960 Tom Jones
musical, "The Fantasticks," settles this ques
tion with the story of two wide-eyed lovers
separated by an anthropomorphic wall built by
faux-feuding fathers.
With simple mossy flooring and a romantic sky back
drop, the minimalism of the intimate stage set the scene
for the actors' exuberance. The musical opens in a frenzy
with the cast of eight scurrying about the stage. Amid cap
tive viewers, the brooding narrator and bandit El Gallo
(Joel Chapman 'l4) encourages the full audience to "Try
to Remember" the lackadaisical days of September.
Fittingly enough, early days of September for most
Stanford students indeed consist of happy-go-lucky mus
ings free from problem sets and midterms, and the musi
cal's opening number enchanted as the lively story of
Luisa and Matt (Annie Sherman 'l4 and Ben Laboy 'l3
M.S. 'l4) unraveled.
Harmonized with her delicate soprano voice, Sher
man's actions perfectly embodied the innocence of a six
teen-year-old girl as she marveled at how her life is filled
with "Much More" excitement than is typical for a girl
her age. Laboy complements Sherman's juvenile charac
ter with lofty prose and expressive dinner-plate-sized eyes
that charm even the separating wall known as The Mute
(Matt Herrero 'l7). Throughout the
duration of the two-hour musical,
Herrero's silent charm effortlessly
drew the audience into the dramat
ic world of the two adoring fanta
sticks.
One of the show's highlights
was the covert relationship between
neighboring gardeners and quaint
fathers Hucklebee and Bellomy
(Weston Gaylord 'l5 and Mark
O'Meara 'l3). In addition to their
praise of radishes, the schemers'
elaborate four-minute handshake,
consisting of coordinated leg-grab
bing and galactic transmissions, in
cited amused laughter and de
served applause.
Comical performances by Henry
and sidekick Mortimer (Davy Lu 'l6
and Jin Park' 16) made creative use of
seppuku and self-immolation in a dis
play of impressionist ability and cul
tural awareness. The pair added
cheer to the growing parental anxi
eties of Hucklebee and Bellomy and
to the increasingly melodramatic rela
tionship between Luisa and Matt.
Act II sheds light on the pains of
love en route to the actual happy
ending. During the musical's longest
song, "Round and Round," the pro
duction team overcame the cozy
stage size by using artistic lighting
and human shadow puppets to de
pict Luisa and El Gallo's fantasies as
Matt became a prodigal son. Witty
music and inviting performances
from all characters allowed "The
Fantasticks" to show that transient
endings are merely part of a larger
story.
