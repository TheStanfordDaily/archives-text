## "Fantasticks" has simple charm 
### SOPHIA DAO 
When nighttime jubilees pass and come undone,
how do happy endings appear in the sun? Di
rected by Ken Savage 'l4, the 1960 Tom Jones
musical, "The Fantasticks," settles this ques
tion with the story of two wide-eyed lovers
separated by an anthropomorphic wall built by
faux-feuding fathers.
With simple mossy flooring and a romantic sky back
drop, the minimalism of the intimate stage set the scene
for the actors' exuberance. The musical opens in a frenzy
with the cast of eight scurrying about the stage. Amid cap
tive viewers, the brooding narrator and bandit El Gallo
(Joel Chapman 'l4) encourages the full audience to "Try
to Remember" the lackadaisical days of September.
Fittingly enough, early days of September for most
Stanford students indeed consist of happy-go-lucky mus
ings free from problem sets and midterms, and the musi
cal's opening number enchanted as the lively story of
Luisa and Matt (Annie Sherman 'l4 and Ben Laboy 'l3
M.S. 'l4) unraveled.
Harmonized with her delicate soprano voice, Sher
man's actions perfectly embodied the innocence of a six
teen-year-old girl as she marveled at how her life is filled
with "Much More" excitement than is typical for a girl
her age. Laboy complements Sherman's juvenile charac
ter with lofty prose and expressive dinner-plate-sized eyes
that charm even the separating wall known as The Mute
