# Behavioral biology class proves popular
## Class leaders credit course content, professor's reputation

While CS 106A: Introductory Programming may be
Stanford's most popular class, 810 150: Human Behavioral
Biology, a class taught by Professor of Biology Robert
Sapolsky, may be close behind
Approximately 400 to 500 students have enrolled in each
iteration of the class, which has been offered every other
spring quarter for a decade. The students, most of whom
are upperclassmen, are usually an even mixture of biology,
human biology, psychology or anthropology majors.
While a rumor that Sapolsky planned to stop teaching
the course emerged earlier this year, Sapolsky refuted that
claim.
"I've got no plans to not be doing it for years to come,"
he said, easing the worries of any students who haven't tak
en the course yet.
The class experience
The popular class's roots can be traced back to Sapol
sky's experience as an undergraduate at Harvard with
Melvin Konner, who had taught a class that explored the bi
ology of human social behavior from many disciplinary an
gles. Sapolsky described that class as having had the great
est intellectual influence on him.
"[The class] had a huge impact on me, and I vowed to

Robert Sapolsky, professor of biology, refuted the
rumors that his popular human behavioral biology class
would no longer be taught after this academic year.
teach something along the
same lines when I grew up,"
Sapolsky said.
This quarter, Sapolsky's
course consists of three
weekly two-hour lectures,
during which Sapolsky most
ly just speaks and uses some
board drawn diagrams but
no PowerPoint, according to
class teaching assistant
Nathan Barnett 'l2 M.S. 'l4.
According to Barnett, the
first half of the course focus
es on fields of thought that
are crucial to understand be
fore approaching theories on
human behavioral biology,
such as sociobiology, molecu
lar genetics and ethology. In
the second half of the course,
these tools are used to explore
topics such as sexual behavior,
depression and religion.
"The best tool [the class]
gives its students is the abili
ty to think critically about
new data," Barnett said.
"When The New York Times
posts a new controversial
study on depression, Bio 150
alums will be ready to rip it
apart and make good conclu
sions for themselves about its
validity."
Practically 90 percent of
the course material remains
the same year after year, ac
cording to Sapolsky, but with
each new round of teaching,
the curriculum is slightly up
dated in order to keep up
with scientific progress made.

The class culture
Some former students
even return to serve as TAs
for the class. Doc Edge 'OB,
Ph.D. 'l6 initially took the
class as a freshman.
"It influenced me a 10t...
and it made me more careful
about interpreting studies,"
Edge said. "Everything I've
worked on [since then] has
been related to the course in
some way."
"It was the best senior
spring class I could have
asked for... I knew I had to
apply [to TA] for the chance
to experience the course in a
whole new way" Barnett said.
When asked what he
thinks makes the class so
popular, Sapolsky credited it
is the course material.
"From a purely objective
standpoint... I think that this
is the most interesting possi
ble subject in the universe to
think about, so maybe it re
flects some agreement on
that," he said.
Barnett expressed similar
sentiments.
"Human behavior and dis
ease can be quite mysterious,
and the opportunity for expla
nations is quite tempting," he
said. "There's a sense that
this class [offers its students]
things that apply to their
everyday lives."
However, Sapolsky also
attributed the popularity of
the class, which has no pre
requisites, to the efforts of the
teaching to make the class ac
cessible, regardless the
amount of science back
ground students have.
Edge and Barnett also ar

gued that Sapolsky's reputa
tion and famous lecturing
style offer further reasons for
the popularity of the course.
"Professor Sapolsky's
reputation precedes him,"
Barnett said.
"Every [lecture] is well
crafted, funny and insanely
interesting for basically the
entire time," Edge added.
When asked what he en
joyed most about teaching
810 150, Sapolsky focused on
the small things.
"Seeing people get excit
ed as various pieces of infor
mation come into place in
helping to explain human be
havior," Sapolsky said. "And
getting to use all the different
colored markers that they
keep stocked in the lecture
halls in the Engineering
Quad."
