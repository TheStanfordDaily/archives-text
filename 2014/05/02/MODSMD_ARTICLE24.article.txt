## Knight discusses "Locke" 
### ALEXANDRA HEENEY 
In the British psychological
thriller "Locke," Tom Hardy
spends 80 minutes inside
his car, driving, while he
deals with both personal
and professional crises. We
never leave the car and we
never leave Hardy, although
there are many intrusions
from the outside world: he
spends almost the entire film
making phone calls.
Steven Knight, who
wrote and directed the film, is
already a critically acclaimed
screenwriter ("Dirty Pretty
Things" and "Eastern Promis
es") but has taken to directing
films that are off-the-beaten
path passion projects. The
Daily sat down with Knight
earlier this month to discuss
the making of his second fea
ture as a director, which
opens in the Bay Area today.
Here are some excerpts from
our conversation.
The Stanford Daily (TSD):
What came first: Tom Hardy's
character, Locke, or the con
cept of the movie, that it takes
place entirely in a car?
Steven Knight (SK): It was
the two things at the same
time. It was about the person
and the belief that making a
film about an ordinary tragedy
was worth doing. I thought
you could deal with an ordi
nary person's tragedy in that
environment [of a car] and the
two things seemed to go to
gether. I think this can only
work if people really identify
with the character, if his expe
rience was something like
what they could have. I don't
think this could work if he
were an assassin on his way to
kill the Prime Minister.

The great thing about
this film is that the intimacy
and the story go together.

When the lights go up at the
end of screenings, the most
unexpected people get very
emotional and talk about
things in their own lives. Peo
ple said, "this is the journey
my dad never made," "this is
the journey I never made or I
should have made." So people
really do see that it's some
thing similar to their own
dilemmas. And that I think
helps with the intimacy be
cause then you stay with it.
TSD: The entire film takes
place in a car, but it's never vi
sually boring. What did you
think about when you were
trying to figure out how to
keep it visually interesting
when you've got such a small
space that you're working in?
SK: We started out doing this
as an experiment: could we get
away with this, could we do
this? I truly believe no matter
what the film, no matter what
the budget and the special ef
fects, the part of the screen
where most people are looking
is the actor's eyes. They want
to know what's going on in the
head of the actor. And that's
still, I think, what filmmaking is
about. But then the question is,
'is that enough'?
In this film, it has to be,
because we just see one char
acter's life unravel, and we
watch him from the waist up
deal with it. However, I'd just
finished making a conven
tional film where we tested
the cameras by shooting
footage from a moving car in
an urban environment. I
thought it was beautiful, and
it stood alone almost like an
installation. I wondered if
you could take that moving
image and turn that into a
theatre, and then put an ac
tor into it, and then shoot a
play in that theatre. That was
the challenge. We knew that

we weren't going to come
out of the car at any point,
but we just wanted it to be
quite beautiful. I quite like
that you can turn the sound
down [and] it will still look
quite interesting visually.
TSD: Throughout the film,
there are many images of
blurred lights. I thought, at
one point, that that was sup
posed to be Locke's vision be
cause he's crying so much.
SK: It is that. It's exactly
that. I really wanted it to rain
and it never did. I had to wet
down the windscreen a cou
ple of times to get that. It's
when you're driving, and the
emotion comes, and all the
lights are like that because
it's blurred. And you see that
going in and out of focus.
When it goes out of focus,
you see lights moving back
and forth which just be
comes completely unreal vi
sion. It's very surreal, like a
painting, and I was very inter
ested in putting a man who is
concrete, who's solid, who's
hard in reality, into that envi
ronment where everything is
out of control, and he's try
ing to control it.
TSD: And he doesn't know
where he is.
SK: Yeah. And the road
signs, the whole business of
when you deconstruct the
film and you talk about the
character's journey, his arc,
his destination, in this, it's all
real. He's on a journey. You
know he's going down this
road. You know where he's
heading. You know where
he's coming from, and that
just means that you're free
then to deal with other things.

TSD: But you don't often
shoot from his perspective.

We don't see what he sees, so
we don't see where he's going
to. The camera is mostly just
looking at him.
SK: I wanted to use the fur
niture of a car to make these
metaphorical analogies. The
GPS is where he's going, and
he's got no choice. That's
where you're going; there's
the arrow; and it's going up
that road. The road ahead is
the future. The past is in the
rearview mirror. So when he's
talking to his dad, who is
dead, he talks into the
rearview mirror because
that's what happened in the
past. So it's quite a neat sort of
geography within the car that
gives you all these metaphors.
TSD: You shot the film digi
tally, using a Red Camera.
How was that? Where did you
put the cameras?
SK: Yes. Shooting digitally
was an absolute definite be
cause we were shooting at
night and shooting from a ve
hicle. It was actually the Alexa
that I used before, and that
was fantastic. Then it was a
toss-up between the Alexa
and the Red, and the Red was
a bit more compact, so we
could get more space in the
car with the Red.
We moved the cameras
around. We put the car on a
low loader: we took the
wheels off so that it was the
right height relative to the
road. Then we put three cam
eras in, and set off on the jour
ney. We shot the film begin
ning-to-end in sequence, so
we shot it two times a night,
the whole thing. I would say
action, and then the calls were
real phone calls from a confer
ence room in a hotel. [The ac
tors] would make the calls in
sequence every time. We
would never go back and do a

re-take. The Red camera has a
memory of thirty minutes. So
every twenty-seven minutes,
we'd pull over, change the
memory card, change the
lens, change the angle so we
had maximum amount of vari
ety for the whole thing, and
then set off again. Every ad
vantage came from digital: you
couldn't have done it with this
agility in any other way.
TSD: What was your ap
proach to working with the
actors and rehearsing for the
film?
SK: We spent five days sitting
around a table, all of the ac
tors with Tom. Any sort of di
rection and character stuff
was dealt with there. So by
the time we went on the
road, there was hardly any
need to refer to actors and
tell them what to do. There
were some occasions when
you wanted to try something
different. Halfway through
[the shoot], I sort of wrote a
couple of letters to the actors
saying we've got that version,
now let's try where you're
more angry or whatever.
But I did it away from the
event of filming. Because of
the nature of how we filmed
it, you don't want to inter
rupt it to ask them to do it
again. It was more establish
ing the character, then let's
shoot it, then try something
different, with a letter sent
during the day so the actor

can read it. And then that
night, trying it. just letting it
all go and see what happens.
Because we were shooting it
so often, they [would] get it
wrong in a different place
every night and get it right in
a different place every night.
So it was easy to cut between
the different versions.
TSD: Were there continuity
issues with doing that?
SIC: It didn't matter about
the continuity of the back
ground as long as there were
lights and cars. There was a
very early thought that we
have to do each phone con
versation on the same stretch
of motorway, because of the
continuity problem. But if
anyone is looking at the mo
torway anyway, and identify
ing lamp posts, then you're in
trouble anyway. So what's
the point? Without the conti
nuity problem, it meant that
if you have a camera in, in the
rearview or sliding that way,
you could always cut from
night four to the same scene
from night six without a
problem. Also, the lighting in
the car keeps changing, so
you don't have that continu
ity problem either. Every de
cision on cuts was made ac
cording to performance. It
was always trying to find the
best performance.

end of screenings, the most
unexpected people get very
emotional and talk about
things in their own lives. Peo
ple said, "this is the journey
my dad never made," "this is
the journey I never made or I
should have made." So people
really do see that it's some
thing similar to their own
dilemmas. And that I think
helps with the intimacy be
cause then you stay with it.
TSD: The entire film takes
place in a car, but it's never vi
sually boring. What did you
think about when you were
trying to figure out how to
keep it visually interesting
when you've got such a small
space that you're working in?
SK: We started out doing this
as an experiment: could we get
away with this, could we do
this? I truly believe no matter
what the film, no matter what
the budget and the special ef
fects, the part of the screen
where most people are looking
is the actor's eyes. They want
to know what's going on in the
head of the actor. And that's
still, I think, what filmmaking is
about. But then the question is,
'is that enough'?
In this film, it has to be,
because we just see one char
acter's life unravel, and we
watch him from the waist up
deal with it. However, I'd just
finished making a conven
tional film where we tested
the cameras by shooting
footage from a moving car in
an urban environment. I
thought it was beautiful, and
it stood alone almost like an
installation. I wondered if
you could take that moving
image and turn that into a
theatre, and then put an ac
tor into it, and then shoot a
play in that theatre. That was
the challenge. We knew that

we weren't going to come
out of the car at any point,
but we just wanted it to be
quite beautiful. I quite like
that you can turn the sound
down [and] it will still look
quite interesting visually.
TSD: Throughout the film,
there are many images of
blurred lights. I thought, at
one point, that that was sup
posed to be Locke's vision be
cause he's crying so much.
SK: It is that. It's exactly
that. I really wanted it to rain
and it never did. I had to wet
down the windscreen a cou
ple of times to get that. It's
when you're driving, and the
emotion comes, and all the
lights are like that because
it's blurred. And you see that
going in and out of focus.
When it goes out of focus,
you see lights moving back
and forth which just be
comes completely unreal vi
sion. It's very surreal, like a
painting, and I was very inter
ested in putting a man who is
concrete, who's solid, who's
hard in reality, into that envi
ronment where everything is
out of control, and he's try
ing to control it.
TSD: And he doesn't know
where he is.
SK: Yeah. And the road
signs, the whole business of
when you deconstruct the
film and you talk about the
character's journey, his arc,
his destination, in this, it's all
real. He's on a journey. You
know he's going down this
road. You know where he's
heading. You know where
he's coming from, and that
just means that you're free
then to deal with other things.

TSD: But you don't often
shoot from his perspective.

We don't see what he sees, so
we don't see where he's going
to. The camera is mostly just
looking at him.
SK: I wanted to use the fur
niture of a car to make these
metaphorical analogies. The
GPS is where he's going, and
he's got no choice. That's
where you're going; there's
the arrow; and it's going up
that road. The road ahead is
the future. The past is in the
rearview mirror. So when he's
talking to his dad, who is
dead, he talks into the
rearview mirror because
that's what happened in the
past. So it's quite a neat sort of
geography within the car that
gives you all these metaphors.
TSD: You shot the film digi
tally, using a Red Camera.
How was that? Where did you
put the cameras?
SK: Yes. Shooting digitally
was an absolute definite be
cause we were shooting at
night and shooting from a ve
hicle. It was actually the Alexa
that I used before, and that
was fantastic. Then it was a
toss-up between the Alexa
and the Red, and the Red was
a bit more compact, so we
could get more space in the
car with the Red.
We moved the cameras
around. We put the car on a
low loader: we took the
wheels off so that it was the
right height relative to the
road. Then we put three cam
eras in, and set off on the jour
ney. We shot the film begin
ning-to-end in sequence, so
we shot it two times a night,
the whole thing. I would say
action, and then the calls were
real phone calls from a confer
ence room in a hotel. [The ac
tors] would make the calls in
sequence every time. We
would never go back and do a

re-take. The Red camera has a
memory of thirty minutes. So
every twenty-seven minutes,
we'd pull over, change the
memory card, change the
lens, change the angle so we
had maximum amount of vari
ety for the whole thing, and
then set off again. Every ad
vantage came from digital: you
couldn't have done it with this
agility in any other way.
TSD: What was your ap
proach to working with the
actors and rehearsing for the
film?
SK: We spent five days sitting
around a table, all of the ac
tors with Tom. Any sort of di
rection and character stuff
was dealt with there. So by
the time we went on the
road, there was hardly any
need to refer to actors and
tell them what to do. There
were some occasions when
you wanted to try something
different. Halfway through
[the shoot], I sort of wrote a
couple of letters to the actors
saying we've got that version,
now let's try where you're
more angry or whatever.
But I did it away from the
event of filming. Because of
the nature of how we filmed
it, you don't want to inter
rupt it to ask them to do it
again. It was more establish
ing the character, then let's
shoot it, then try something
different, with a letter sent
during the day so the actor

can read it. And then that
night, trying it. just letting it
all go and see what happens.
Because we were shooting it
so often, they [would] get it
wrong in a different place
every night and get it right in
a different place every night.
So it was easy to cut between
the different versions.
TSD: Were there continuity
issues with doing that?
SIC: It didn't matter about
the continuity of the back
ground as long as there were
lights and cars. There was a
very early thought that we
have to do each phone con
versation on the same stretch
of motorway, because of the
continuity problem. But if
anyone is looking at the mo
torway anyway, and identify
ing lamp posts, then you're in
trouble anyway. So what's
the point? Without the conti
nuity problem, it meant that
if you have a camera in, in the
rearview or sliding that way,
you could always cut from
night four to the same scene
from night six without a
problem. Also, the lighting in
the car keeps changing, so
you don't have that continu
ity problem either. Every de
cision on cuts was made ac
cording to performance. It
was always trying to find the
best performance.

In the British psychological
thriller "Locke," Tom Hardy
spends 80 minutes inside
his car, driving, while he
deals with both personal
and professional crises. We
never leave the car and we
never leave Hardy, although
there are many intrusions
from the outside world: he
spends almost the entire film
making phone calls.
Steven Knight, who
wrote and directed the film, is
already a critically acclaimed
screenwriter ("Dirty Pretty
Things" and "Eastern Promis
es") but has taken to directing
films that are off-the-beaten
path passion projects. The
Daily sat down with Knight
earlier this month to discuss
the making of his second fea
ture as a director, which
opens in the Bay Area today.
Here are some excerpts from
our conversation.
The Stanford Daily (TSD):
What came first: Tom Hardy's
character, Locke, or the con
cept of the movie, that it takes
place entirely in a car?
Steven Knight (SK): It was
the two things at the same
time. It was about the person
and the belief that making a
film about an ordinary tragedy
was worth doing. I thought
you could deal with an ordi
nary person's tragedy in that
environment [of a car] and the
two things seemed to go to
gether. I think this can only
work if people really identify
with the character, if his expe
rience was something like
what they could have. I don't
think this could work if he
were an assassin on his way to
kill the Prime Minister.

The great thing about
this film is that the intimacy
and the story go together.

When the lights go up at the
end of screenings, the most
unexpected people get very
emotional and talk about
things in their own lives. Peo

theatre, and then put an ac
tor into it, and then shoot a
play in that theatre. That was
the challenge. We knew that

we weren't going to come
out of the car at any point,
but we just wanted it to be
quite beautiful. I quite like
that you can turn the sound
down [and] it will still look
quite interesting visually.
TSD: Throughout the film,
there are many images of
blurred lights. I thought, at
one point, that that was sup
posed to be Locke's vision be
cause he's crying so much.
SK: It is that. It's exactly
that. I really wanted it to rain
and it never did. I had to wet
down the windscreen a cou
ple of times to get that. It's
when you're driving, and the
emotion comes, and all the
lights are like that because
it's blurred. And you see that
going in and out of focus.
When it goes out of focus,
you see lights moving back
and forth which just be
comes completely unreal vi
sion. It's very surreal, like a
painting, and I was very inter
ested in putting a man who is
concrete, who's solid, who's
hard in reality, into that envi
ronment where everything is
out of control, and he's try
ing to control it.
TSD: And he doesn't know
where he is.
SK: Yeah. And the road
signs, the whole business of
when you deconstruct the
film and you talk about the
character's journey, his arc,
his destination, in this, it's all
real. He's on a journey. You
know he's going down this
road. You know where he's
heading. You know where
he's coming from, and that
just means that you're free
then to deal with other things.

TSD: But you don't often
shoot from his perspective.

We don't see what he sees, so
we don't see where he's going
to. The camera is mostly just
looking at him.
SK: I wanted to use the fur
niture of a car to make these
metaphorical analogies. The
GPS is where he's going, and
he's got no choice. That's
where you're going; there's
the arrow; and it's going up
that road. The road ahead is
the future. The past is in the
rearview mirror. So when he's
talking to his dad, who is
dead, he talks into the
rearview mirror because
that's what happened in the
past. So it's quite a neat sort of
geography within the car that
gives you all these metaphors.
TSD: You shot the film digi
tally, using a Red Camera.
How was that? Where did you
put the cameras?
SK: Yes. Shooting digitally
was an absolute definite be
cause we were shooting at
night and shooting from a ve
hicle. It was actually the Alexa
that I used before, and that
was fantastic. Then it was a
toss-up between the Alexa
and the Red, and the Red was
a bit more compact, so we
could get more space in the
car with the Red.
We moved the cameras
around. We put the car on a
low loader: we took the
wheels off so that it was the
right height relative to the
road. Then we put three cam
eras in, and set off on the jour
ney. We shot the film begin
ning-to-end in sequence, so
we shot it two times a night,
the whole thing. I would say
action, and then the calls were
real phone calls from a confer
ence room in a hotel. [The ac
tors] would make the calls in
sequence every time. We
would never go back and do a

re-take. The Red camera has a
memory of thirty minutes. So
every twenty-seven minutes,
we'd pull over, change the
memory card, change the
lens, change the angle so we
had maximum amount of vari
ety for the whole thing, and
then set off again. Every ad
vantage came from digital: you
couldn't have done it with this
agility in any other way.
TSD: What was your ap
proach to working with the
actors and rehearsing for the
film?
SK: We spent five days sitting
around a table, all of the ac
tors with Tom. Any sort of di
rection and character stuff
was dealt with there. So by
the time we went on the
road, there was hardly any
need to refer to actors and
tell them what to do. There
were some occasions when
you wanted to try something
different. Halfway through
[the shoot], I sort of wrote a
couple of letters to the actors
saying we've got that version,
now let's try where you're
more angry or whatever.
But I did it away from the
event of filming. Because of
the nature of how we filmed
it, you don't want to inter
rupt it to ask them to do it
again. It was more establish
ing the character, then let's
shoot it, then try something
different, with a letter sent
during the day so the actor

can read it. And then that
night, trying it. just letting it
all go and see what happens.
Because we were shooting it
so often, they [would] get it
wrong in a different place
every night and get it right in
a different place every night.
So it was easy to cut between
the different versions.
TSD: Were there continuity
issues with doing that?
SIC: It didn't matter about
the continuity of the back
ground as long as there were
lights and cars. There was a
very early thought that we
have to do each phone con
versation on the same stretch
of motorway, because of the
continuity problem. But if
anyone is looking at the mo
torway anyway, and identify
ing lamp posts, then you're in
trouble anyway. So what's
the point? Without the conti
nuity problem, it meant that
if you have a camera in, in the
rearview or sliding that way,
you could always cut from
night four to the same scene
from night six without a
problem. Also, the lighting in
the car keeps changing, so
you don't have that continu
ity problem either. Every de
cision on cuts was made ac
cording to performance. It
was always trying to find the
best performance.

In the British psychological
thriller "Locke," Tom Hardy
spends 80 minutes inside
his car, driving, while he
deals with both personal
and professional crises. We
never leave the car and we
never leave Hardy, although
there are many intrusions
from the outside world: he
spends almost the entire film
making phone calls.
Steven Knight, who
wrote and directed the film, is
already a critically acclaimed
screenwriter ("Dirty Pretty
Things" and "Eastern Promis
es") but has taken to directing
films that are off-the-beaten
path passion projects. The
Daily sat down with Knight
earlier this month to discuss
the making of his second fea
ture as a director, which
opens in the Bay Area today.
Here are some excerpts from
our conversation.
The Stanford Daily (TSD):
What came first: Tom Hardy's
character, Locke, or the con
cept of the movie, that it takes
place entirely in a car?
Steven Knight (SK): It was
the two things at the same
time. It was about the person
and the belief that making a
film about an ordinary tragedy
was worth doing. I thought
you could deal with an ordi
nary person's tragedy in that
environment [of a car] and the
two things seemed to go to
gether. I think this can only
work if people really identify
with the character, if his expe
rience was something like
what they could have. I don't
think this could work if he
were an assassin on his way to
kill the Prime Minister.

The great thing about
this film is that the intimacy
and the story go together.

When the lights go up at the
end of screenings, the most
unexpected people get very
emotional and talk about
things in their own lives. Peo
ple said, "this is the journey
my dad never made," "this is
the journey I never made or I
should have made." So people
really do see that it's some
thing similar to their own
dilemmas. And that I think
helps with the intimacy be
cause then you stay with it.
TSD: The entire film takes
place in a car, but it's never vi
sually boring. What did you
think about when you were
trying to figure out how to
keep it visually interesting
when you've got such a small
space that you're working in?
SK: We started out doing this
as an experiment: could we get
away with this, could we do
this? I truly believe no matter
what the film, no matter what
the budget and the special ef
fects, the part of the screen
where most people are looking
is the actor's eyes. They want
to know what's going on in the
head of the actor. And that's
still, I think, what filmmaking is
about. But then the question is,
'is that enough'?
In this film, it has to be,
because we just see one char
acter's life unravel, and we
watch him from the waist up
deal with it. However, I'd just
finished making a conven
tional film where we tested
the cameras by shooting
footage from a moving car in
an urban environment. I
thought it was beautiful, and
it stood alone almost like an
installation. I wondered if
you could take that moving
image and turn that into a
theatre, and then put an ac
tor into it, and then shoot a
play in that theatre. That was
the challenge. We knew that

we weren't going to come
out of the car at any point,
but we just wanted it to be
quite beautiful. I quite like
that you can turn the sound
down [and] it will still look
quite interesting visually.
