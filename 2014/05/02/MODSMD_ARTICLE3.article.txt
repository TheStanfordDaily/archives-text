Yesterday evening, the Hasso Plat
tner Institute of Design (d.school) host
ed "Stanford 2025: A Retrospective of
Learning and Living on Campus," an
experiential exhibit featuring student
and faculty member projects that show
cased different concepts of the future of

higher education in a culmination of the
d.school's ©Stanford project.
For the past year, the @ Stanford
project has offered a series of classes
and experiments exploring themes re
lating to the future of the on-campus ex
perience at Stanford, with a particular
emphasis placed on the emerging role
of technology in online learning, accord
ing to d.school communication director

Debbe Stern.
Stern added that the interdiscipli
nary @Stanford team comprised pro
fessors, designers, approximately 200
students and 60 to 75 administrators.
Event attendees were first invited to
a reception outside the d.school, which
featured bulletin boards on students' in-

dividual projects. David Kel
ley '77, founder of the
d.school, introduced the
event, emphasizing that the
ideas featured were solely
conceptual.
"What you're about to see
are just provocations," Kel
ley said. "We're not saying
these are the best ideas or
these are the only ideas.
There will be big ideas, there
will be small ones. There will
be rough ideas, there will be
refined ones. We're not at
tached to any of them. But
what we do believe we have
uncovered is our needs, the
non-obvious needs we need
to solve in order to make this
a special place. They're
provocations; they're ex
ploratory."
Attendees were given in
formational packets attached
to a tube that later was re
vealed to hold polarized sun
glasses before being led into

the d.school atrium, which
were split into a number of
different stations that exhib
ited various ideas of what
learning might look like at
Stanford in a little over 10
years.
The stations included
"Paced Education," "Axis
Flip," "Purpose Learning"
and "Open Loop University,"
and each encouraged event
attendees to ask questions of
what the future of education
would look like.
For example, the "Open
Loop University" station ex
plored challenging the cur
rent structures of learning,
namely the timing of when
someone would pursue high
er-level education.
"One of the main things
was asking the question,
'When over a person's life
time does it make sense and
is it useful to have an academ
ic experience?"' said Sarah
Stein Greenberg MBA 'O6,
managing director at the
d.school and part of the
©Stanford project team.
"Our current paradigm is
that you go to college in your

early adulthood ... and if you
think about learning as a bio
logical opportunity, it's weird
that we package it all in the
beginning and say that you're
ready to go out in the world
where in the real world peo
ple are moving constantly
and new industries are being
created all the time," she
added.
At the end of the exhibi
tion, the ©Stanford team ex
pressed hope that the event
will help students rethink
and potentially reshape their
academic experience.
"We hope you'll start your
own experience, that these
provocations, that these ideas
you see here will cause you to
go back to your different de
partments and different or
ganizations and really start
to experiment," Kelley said.
"We really believe that if we
start a bunch of small brush
fires around the University,
then eventually they'll grow
together and we'll have this
big improvement."
