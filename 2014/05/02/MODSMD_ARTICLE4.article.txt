## Researchers develop tool for neural imaging 
### JULIA TURAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Two teams of Stanford scientists have
created long-sought-after neuroscience
tools that allow researchers to observe
living neurons signal to each other in re
al time.
The studies, led by postdoctoral
scholars Francois St-Pierre (from Assis
tant Professor of Pediatrics Michael
Lin's lab) and Yiyang Gong (from Associ
ate Professor of Biology Mark
Schnitzer's lab), were published April 22
in "Nature Neuroscience" and "Nature
Communications," respectively.
Both studies featured the use of fluo
rescent protein voltage sensors, which

can be inserted into specific groups of
brain cells and which emit light when the
nerves fire off signals. These sensors of
fer faster kinetics and higher brightness
than preexisting imaging tools.
Existing methods to detect signaling
between neurons make use of genetical
ly-encoded fluorescent calcium indica
tors, which do not provide a direct read
out of membrane potential changes.
Limitations of calcium imaging include
an inability to track individual action po
tentials in many fast-spiking cell types,
which affects the accuracy of the report
ing of neuronal activity.
The high-fidelity optical reporting of
fered by these newly-developed protein
voltage sensors allow for monitoring of

genetically-defined neuronal circuits
without the requirement of direct chem
ical access.
"The challenge of voltage sensing has
always been to get a sensor that is bright
enough and has high enough dynamic
range in response to voltage in the phys
iological range," Lin explained.
In addition to high speed and high
spatial resolution, the sensor itself needs
to respond quickly to membrane poten
tial changes.
One technique scientists use to study
electrical signaling is patch clamping,
which allows for the study of single or
multiple ion channels in excitable cells.
Instead of using patch
clamping, drug developers
can use these new tools to
look at the effects of drugs on
neuronal signaling.
"Wouldn't it be great if in
stead of having a contact
method, you could just use
light as an output to see if
your compound had an effect
or not?" St-Pierre said.
These protein voltage sen
sors also work in neurons in a
petri dish. Drug developers
could test the effectiveness of
drugs targeting diseases like
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's
by observing in real time the
way a drag affects nerve fir
ings.
Gong described the two
labs' joint developments as
the latest effort to achieve ac
curate optical reporting of
electrical activity in neuronal
populations, a long-standing
goal in neuroscience.
"Our field is somewhat
akin to guided guessing,"
Gong said. "There have been
incremental developments on
how to make these tools
bright so they have higher
signal for our eyes or a cam
era to see."
The money for their proj
ect came from a Stanford Bio-
X seed grant, which funds

high-risk â€”and high reward
projects.
The teams have worked to
further refine their proteins
to respond uniquely to differ
ent types of neurons, so re
searchers will be able to iso
late the effects of certain cell
types. Lin and Schnitzer re

ceived additional funding
through a Bio-X Neuroven
tures grant, and said they
anticipate their latest inven
tion enabling further excit
ing applications.
