## Outdoor displays increase access to art

In a small dealing near the
Cantor Arts Center sits a winding
stone sculpture. The spine-like
structure, called "Stone River," was
crafted by British sculptor Andy
Goldsworthy in 2001 and is made
out of stacked broken sandstone
from the 1906 and 1989 earth
quakes.
This sculpture is just one of
many that make up the Universi
ty's distinguished and vibrant out
door ait collection. There are near
ly 150 different pieces in the collec
tion, which spans over 100 years
and includes modern, contempo
rary, abstract and figurative works.
Some of the earliest works, like An
tonio Frilli's "Faith and Menander,"
were on campus at the same time
as Leland and Jane Stanford.
Connie Wolf 'Bl, the museum di

rector at Cantor, spoke to the im
portance of having outdoor art on
campus.
"I think that ait needs to per
meate our lives in as many ways as
it can... we need to make sure that
art is extended as far as possible on
campus and meets people where
they are," Wolf said.
To that end, Cantor has sought
to disperse the many pieces across
diverse areas of campus from
the Stanford Equestrian Center
parking lot to the Stanford Arbore
tum.
One of the most notable outdoor
art attractions is Cantor's impres
sive collection of Auguste Rodin's
bronze sculptures, located to the
light of the museum in the Rodin
Sculpture Garden and at Memorial
Court.
