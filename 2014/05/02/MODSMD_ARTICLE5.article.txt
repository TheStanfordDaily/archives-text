## Outdoor displays increase access to art 
### JOSIE HODSON DESK EDITOR 
In a small dealing near the
Cantor Arts Center sits a winding
stone sculpture. The spine-like
structure, called "Stone River," was
crafted by British sculptor Andy
Goldsworthy in 2001 and is made
out of stacked broken sandstone
from the 1906 and 1989 earth
quakes.
This sculpture is just one of
many that make up the Universi
ty's distinguished and vibrant out
door ait collection. There are near
ly 150 different pieces in the collec
tion, which spans over 100 years
and includes modern, contempo
rary, abstract and figurative works.
Some of the earliest works, like An
tonio Frilli's "Faith and Menander,"
were on campus at the same time
as Leland and Jane Stanford.
Connie Wolf 'Bl, the museum di

rector at Cantor, spoke to the im
portance of having outdoor art on
campus.
"I think that ait needs to per
meate our lives in as many ways as
it can... we need to make sure that
art is extended as far as possible on
campus and meets people where
they are," Wolf said.
To that end, Cantor has sought
to disperse the many pieces across
diverse areas of campus from
the Stanford Equestrian Center
parking lot to the Stanford Arbore
tum.
One of the most notable outdoor
art attractions is Cantor's impres
sive collection of Auguste Rodin's
bronze sculptures, located to the
light of the museum in the Rodin
Sculpture Garden and at Memorial
Court.

campus as generous gifts
from donors, others are pur
chased or commissioned with
funds raised by Cantor. Wolf
noted that every piece is care
fully chosen by the Outdoor
Ait Panel, which is comprised
of faculty, staff, volunteers and
students.
Their tastes are selective
in the past the museum has
refused donated art because it
did not meet museum stan
dards.
"We are looking for a cer
tain level of excellence and
works that we think that will
be meaningful to students and
that are important works of
art," Wolf said. 'A work that is
important to students is one
that is something that you can
enjoy, something that makes
you think, something that cre
ates a kind of oasis to experi
ence, something... that chal
lenges you a little bit."
The most recent additions
to the collection include "Mi
wok" by Mark Di Suvero, lo
cated at the Stanford Medical
School on the Dean's Lawn,
"The Three Graces" by
Charles Ginnever at the Oval,
"Bedford Sentinels" by Bever
ly Pepper next to the Landau
Economics Building, and
Goldsworthy's "Stone River."
While the collection will
continue to receive new addi
tions, there is no plan to let go
of any of the older pieces.
"We're never getting rid of
any of them," Wolf said.
"These are works that are in
our collection, and you just
don't get rid of any of them.
You take care of them."
A staff made up of paid stu
dent technicians maintains the
pieces. The technicians are
trained by a professional con
servator to effectively wash,
wax and remove any potential
graffiti from the sculptures,
according to Susan Roberts-
Manganelli, manager of collec
tions, exhibitions and conser
vation at the Cantor. All of the
works are cleaned on a 60- or
90-day rotation.
While pieces are some
times moved Mark di Su
vero's "The Sieve of Eratos
thenes" was recently relocat
ed to a vacant grassy patch
outside of Stern Hall due to
construction at its primary lo

cation the curators empha
sized that the museum tries to
avoid it whenever possible.
Moving a large outdoor
piece can be complicated and
expensive, totaling anywhere
from $25,000 to $150,000.
Identifying the spot for relo
cation requires a team of ar
chitects and curators to take
into account everything from
irrigation and surrounding
vegetation, as sap from over
hanging trees can be harmful
to the works.

While the outdoor pieces
may vary greatly in form, they
all share the defining quality
of interactivity. At the di Su
vero sculpture outside of
Stern, on any given day, stu

dents congregate under,
around, and even on top of the
red structure (although Wolf
was quick to note that sitting
on the sculpture is not al
lowed.) Elementary schools
often make visits to the Rodin
sculpture garden, running
around and eating lunch at the
feet of the late 19th century
bronze figures.
'M of the sculptures on
campus are available to view
at all hours, seven days a
week," Wolf said. "We want
people to experience it when
ever they want to. Art on cam
pus is for everybody."

and includes modern, contempo

Some of the earliest works, like An
tonio Frilli's "Faith and Menander,"
were on campus at the same time
as Leland and Jane Stanford.
Connie Wolf 'Bl, the museum di

rector at Cantor, spoke to the im
portance of having outdoor art on
campus.
"I think that ait needs to per
meate our lives in as many ways as
it can... we need to make sure that
art is extended as far as possible on
campus and meets people where
they are," Wolf said.
To that end, Cantor has sought
to disperse the many pieces across
diverse areas of campus from
the Stanford Equestrian Center
parking lot to the Stanford Arbore
tum.
One of the most notable outdoor
art attractions is Cantor's impres
sive collection of Auguste Rodin's
bronze sculptures, located to the
light of the museum in the Rodin
Sculpture Garden and at Memorial
Court.

"We are looking for a cer
tain level of excellence and
works that we think that will
be meaningful to students and
that are important works of
art," Wolf said. 'A work that is
important to students is one
that is something that you can

The most recent additions
to the collection include "Mi

cated at the Stanford Medical
School on the Dean's Lawn,
"The Three Graces" by
Charles Ginnever at the Oval,
"Bedford Sentinels" by Bever

Economics Building, and
Goldsworthy's "Stone River."
While the collection will
continue to receive new addi

of any of the older pieces.
"We're never getting rid of
any of them," Wolf said.
"These are works that are in
our collection, and you just
don't get rid of any of them.
You take care of them."
A staff made up of paid stu
dent technicians maintains the
pieces. The technicians are
trained by a professional con
servator to effectively wash,
wax and remove any potential
graffiti from the sculptures,
according to Susan Roberts-
Manganelli, manager of collec

vation at the Cantor. All of the
works are cleaned on a 60- or
90-day rotation.

Moving a large outdoor
piece can be complicated and
expensive, totaling anywhere
from $25,000 to $150,000.
Identifying the spot for relo
cation requires a team of ar
chitects and curators to take
into account everything from
irrigation and surrounding
vegetation, as sap from over
hanging trees can be harmful
to the works.

While the outdoor pieces
may vary greatly in form, they
all share the defining quality
of interactivity. At the di Su

Stern, on any given day, stu

dents congregate under,
around, and even on top of the
red structure (although Wolf
was quick to note that sitting
on the sculpture is not al
lowed.) Elementary schools
often make visits to the Rodin
sculpture garden, running
around and eating lunch at the
feet of the late 19th century
bronze figures.
'M of the sculptures on
campus are available to view
at all hours, seven days a
week," Wolf said. "We want
people to experience it when
ever they want to. Art on cam
pus is for everybody."

In a small dealing near the
Cantor Arts Center sits a winding
stone sculpture. The spine-like
structure, called "Stone River," was
crafted by British sculptor Andy
Goldsworthy in 2001 and is made
out of stacked broken sandstone
from the 1906 and 1989 earth
quakes.
This sculpture is just one of
many that make up the Universi
ty's distinguished and vibrant out
door ait collection. There are near
ly 150 different pieces in the collec
tion, which spans over 100 years
and includes modern, contempo
