## NCAA would implode under free market 
### Joseph Beyda 
Two rebuttals in, Cameron
Miller and I are finally
starting to get somewhere.
I've realized that, to a large
degree, I agree with my
runner-turned-rabble-rouser col
league. It is unfair that Shabazz
Napier helps UConn and the NCAA
generate millions of dollars in rev
enue, but that he doesn't have
enough to eat at night. It is unfair
that a computer science student can
take part in a sponsorship deal from
a software company though as
an electrical engineering major, I'd
like to cast doubt on the implication
that this happens, like, ever but
that Johnny Manziel has to wait un
til he leaves college to make money
the same way.
And, yes, it is unfair that my fel
low columnist wasn't able to work as
an extra in a movie about running
because of his student-athlete sta
tus. That's a true shame; if there's a
character at The Daily, it's
Cameron.
But even though I agree with
Cameron that all of these things are
problems, I think that his solution,
a free-market system under which
NCAA student-athletes could be
paid without restrictions just like
any other employee, would essen
tially destroy college athletics.
I hinted at this point a couple
columns ago, noting that the re
sultant bidding war for top ath
letes would crowd out all but the
richest programs. According to
Cameron, this is just "the in
evitable result of laissez-faire,
free-market capitalism: some win
and some lose." I'm afraid the out
look is not that rosy.
Let's focus on football, the
NCAA's crown jewel and one of on
ly two college sports that are gen
erally profitable. This is where the
money lives in college athletics
FBS schools generated a median
$3.5 million in net revenue from
their football teams in 2011 â€”and
chances are, programs would do
whatever they could to stay rele
vant and retain that revenue.
So let's say that, conservatively,
an FBS team decided to pay each of
its 85 scholarship football players
an average of $15,000 a year to keep
its program competitive. Where
does the school get that $1,275,000?
It can't just cut into its football prof
its, which are being used to fund
other programs all of which, oth
er than men's basketball, are likely
to finish in the red each and every
year.
The obvious answer would be to
reduce the athletic department's ex
penses by cutting some of those un
profitable programs. How about
men's and women's track and field
and cross country? Those sports, to
gether, lost $1,123,000 in 2011 at the
median FBS school, so cutting them
should cover most of the costs need
ed to keep the football team going.
That is, until next year's football
recruits start demanding a higher
salary.
Before long, the NCAA would
become essentially an NFL minor
league, devoid of the Olympic sports
and the 400,000 non-football ath
letes (compared to 70,000 football
players) that the NCAA supports
today.
That's 400,000 people who would
likely "lose" in Cameron's ideal
world, and he's one of them.
Of course, under a free-market
system without restrictions on pay
ing student-athletes, Cameron
would indeed be allowed to work as
an extra in a movie about running.
And while he's at it, he might as well
sign on for a few more movies
he'll have a lot of time, now that his
school has canceled its track pro
gram.
But at least the football program
would still be going strong, right?
Not so fast. When certain schools
run out of programs to cut and
boosters to hound for more money,
they would be forced to limit the
salaries they dole out to players,
putting themselves at a major re
cruiting disadvantage.
There's another loser in this:
Cardinal football. Even though
Stanford is one of the best-funded
universities in the world, I don't
think it would play along with the
rising tide of player salaries by
dumping exorbitant amounts of
money into its football program. For
years, the unwritten rule around
here was that the head football
coach couldn't make more than the
University president. Who knows if
