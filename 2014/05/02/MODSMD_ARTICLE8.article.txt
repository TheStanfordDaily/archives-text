# TITLE IN THE CARDS?
## 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's volleyball is
heading to the NCAA title match
after a thrilling five-set battle
against No. 2 seed BYU in Chicago
on Thursday night.
This is the fifth time that No. 3
seed Stanford (24-8) will play in
the NCAA title match and the
team will looking to bring home its
third NCAA title.

In the last few months, the Car
dinal have seemed destined for this
moment, winning the 14 of their
last 15 matches. But the only speed
bump over that stretch was a
straight-set loss in the MPSF title
game to BYU last week, which
made Thursday's victory over the
Cougars (21-9) all the more
sweet. The Cardinal have adopted
a mentality and style of play that
is distinctly their own and has
pushed them to the high level of
play they demonstrated on
Thursday earning Stanford a spot
in the finals.
The match was a hard-fought
battle between two of the top
teams in the country, with both of
fenses showing just how much
each team wanted a chance to take
a swing at the championship title.
Coming into the match, Stanford
had faced BYU three times al
ready this season and had yet to
find away to overcome the power
ful Cougars offense, led by its All-
American, Taylor Sander.
But the first set on Thursday
was all Stanford, as the Cardinal
led most of the set, hit .679 and
won 25-18. Senior Eric Mochalski
was nearly perfect, hitting 9 for 10
in the set, and Stanford also did a
nice job minimizing BYU blocks,
typically a strength of the
Cougars.
The Cardinal had to be confi

dent after the opening set, as the
team is 21-3 in the season when
winning the first set. Yet the mo
mentum shifted early in the second
set, with BYU adjusting its offense
and taking an early lead. With two
service errors by the Cardinal, the
Cougars were soon up 10-5 in the
set. Despite nice blocking by Stan

ford, the team was unable to rally
from five points down and BYU
took the set 25-21.
BYU kept rolling by taking the
early lead once again in the third
set, forcing Stanford to take time
outs at 10-6 and 16-10. After win
ning the first set so forcefully,
Stanford did not want to lose its

confidence and momentum, espe
cially knowing how quickly BYU
can capitalize off mistakes.
Stanford went on a 6-1 run in
the third set with an ace from sen
ior Steven Irvin followed by Ail-
American Brian Cook's seventh
kill. The set was tied at 20-20 but
BYU took advantage of its service
game to pull ahead and take set
three 25-22. After rallying from be
hind and almost making a third-set
come back, Stanford seemed to
have more energy than BYU.
With the possibility of BYU
winning the match in set four,
Stanford seemed eager to gain the
lead and keep it. Tied at 10-10 and
again at 21-21, the match was at a
critical point and the intensity
ramped up on both sides of the net.
Stanford went up 23-22 with an er
ror by the Cougars but BYU came
back to tie it 25-25.
BYU was two points away from
advancing to the final, but a service
error opened the door for Stanford
to push the match to five sets. The
two teams went back and forth in
suspense, with the set at 26-26 and
then 27-27. Two incredible serves
under pressure by sophomore mid
dle Conrad Kaminski forced the
match into a fifth set, with a serv
ice ace finally winning set four 29-
27 for the Cardinal.
Kaminski continued his power
ful service game with another ace
to open the fifth set. BYU an
swered with its own impressive
service game, taking the lead at 9-
8 before a kill by Mochalski evened
it up.
Two consecutive Cardinal
blocks gave Stanford an 11-9 lead
that it would not relinquish, and in
a storybook ending, Stanford's
true leader in Cook gave the Car
dinal the decisive kill to clinch set
five, winning the match.
Stanford will face Loyola
(Chicago) University at 5 p.m. on
Saturday with the national title on
the line.

hind and almost making a third-set
come back, Stanford seemed to
have more energy than BYU.
With the possibility of BYU
winning the match in set four,
Stanford seemed eager to gain the
lead and keep it. Tied at 10-10 and
again at 21-21, the match was at a
critical point and the intensity
ramped up on both sides of the net.
Stanford went up 23-22 with an er
ror by the Cougars but BYU came
back to tie it 25-25.
BYU was two points away from
advancing to the final, but a service
error opened the door for Stanford
to push the match to five sets. The
two teams went back and forth in
suspense, with the set at 26-26 and
then 27-27. Two incredible serves
under pressure by sophomore mid
dle Conrad Kaminski forced the
match into a fifth set, with a serv
ice ace finally winning set four 29-
27 for the Cardinal.
Kaminski continued his power
ful service game with another ace
to open the fifth set. BYU an
swered with its own impressive
service game, taking the lead at 9-
8 before a kill by Mochalski evened
it up.
Two consecutive Cardinal
blocks gave Stanford an 11-9 lead
that it would not relinquish, and in
a storybook ending, Stanford's
true leader in Cook gave the Car
dinal the decisive kill to clinch set
five, winning the match.
Stanford will face Loyola
(Chicago) University at 5 p.m. on
Saturday with the national title on
the line.

Stanford men's volleyball is
heading to the NCAA title match
after a thrilling five-set battle
against No. 2 seed BYU in Chicago
on Thursday night.
This is the fifth time that No. 3
seed Stanford (24-8) will play in
the NCAA title match and the
team will looking to bring home its
third NCAA title.

In the last few months, the Car
dinal have seemed destined for this
moment, winning the 14 of their
last 15 matches. But the only speed
bump over that stretch was a
straight-set loss in the MPSF title
game to BYU last week, which
made Thursday's victory over the
Cougars (21-9) all the more
sweet. The Cardinal have adopted
a mentality and style of play that
is distinctly their own and has
pushed them to the high level of
play they demonstrated on
Thursday earning Stanford a spot
in the finals.
The match was a hard-fought
battle between two of the top
teams in the country, with both of
fenses showing just how much
each team wanted a chance to take
a swing at the championship title.
Coming into the match, Stanford
had faced BYU three times al
ready this season and had yet to
find away to overcome the power
ful Cougars offense, led by its All-
American, Taylor Sander.
But the first set on Thursday
was all Stanford, as the Cardinal
led most of the set, hit .679 and
won 25-18. Senior Eric Mochalski
was nearly perfect, hitting 9 for 10
in the set, and Stanford also did a
nice job minimizing BYU blocks,
typically a strength of the
Cougars.
The Cardinal had to be confi

dent after the opening set, as the
team is 21-3 in the season when
winning the first set. Yet the mo
mentum shifted early in the second
set, with BYU adjusting its offense
and taking an early lead. With two
service errors by the Cardinal, the
Cougars were soon up 10-5 in the
set. Despite nice blocking by Stan

ford, the team was unable to rally
from five points down and BYU
took the set 25-21.
BYU kept rolling by taking the
early lead once again in the third
set, forcing Stanford to take time
outs at 10-6 and 16-10. After win
ning the first set so forcefully,
Stanford did not want to lose its

confidence and momentum, espe
cially knowing how quickly BYU
can capitalize off mistakes.
Stanford went on a 6-1 run in
the third set with an ace from sen
ior Steven Irvin followed by Ail-
American Brian Cook's seventh
kill. The set was tied at 20-20 but
BYU took advantage of its service
game to pull ahead and take set
three 25-22. After rallying from be
hind and almost making a third-set
come back, Stanford seemed to
have more energy than BYU.
