# CARD PREP FOR BIG ROW
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
This Saturday, all three Stan
ford rowing teams, each ranked
in the top 15 in the nation, will
face Cal in the annual Big Row at
Redwood Shores.
The No. 11 men's team is com
ing off of a weeklong hiatus from
competition after three consecu
tive weekends of racing, the last
of which was a sweep at home in
the Stanford Invitational.
In preparation for No. 2 Cal,
the men spent the week after the
Invite doing more work on the erg
(indoor rowing machine) and split
the varsity into two four-boats to
keep the team in a competitive
mindset. This past week, however,
was a transition back onto the wa
ter with the emphasis placed on
speed work at race pace.
"With the races every week,
we really were on the water all
the time, which is great," said
senior Austin Hack. "But it's nice
to kind of taste your own blood a
little bit and just hit it hard on the
erg to just remember what it
feels like."
In last year's regatta, the Car
dinal were successful against Cal,
upsetting the clear favorites by
1.5 seconds and winning the
Schwabacher Cup for the first

time since 2008. This year, the
Card head into Saturday's regat
ta with more uncertainty as the fi
nal varsity boat (1V8) lineups
have been in constant flux this
season and four freshmen are vy
ing for positions, as opposed to
the four veteran seniors that held
those spots last year.
"It's different than last year
for sure. We had the eight guys
who had been rowing all season
and then maybe one guy would
have a chance [of getting in the
IYB boat]," Hack said. "Against
Cal, we might switch out but in
reality the lineup would be consis
tent, but this year we are just
looking for something that looks
better than what we have."
"It's four seniors [last year]
versus four freshmen," said jun
ior Kaess Smit. "If you look at the
raw power of the boat and talent,
empirically we have the faster
boat [this year]."
Cal heads into Saturday's re
gatta coming off of a narrow loss
to then-No. 2 Washington at Red
wood Shores last weekend. Cal
and Washington are projected to
finish in the top two spots in the
nation at the IRA Championships
in May, so Saturday will be a good
barometer for the men's team
moving forward before Pac-12
Championships and IRAs.

"We're always going to be the
underdogs, that's always how it's
been [against Cal]. But if we can
figure it out and put forth a lot of
good spirit it might turn out
[well]," Hack said. "No matter
what you feel about the race,
when you reach the starting line,
even if you think you're going to
lose, if you're even 500 meters in,
then all that is behind and it's just
racing from there."
The women's races will be a
top-five showdown as No. 4 Stan
ford takes on No. 2 Cal. Cal has
beaten the Card and taken home
the Lambert Cup for the past
four years. With none of the cur
rent rowers on the Stanford team
having beaten Cal during their
times on the Farm and after be
ing swept in all four races last
year, the extra incentive and mo
tivation to succeed this Saturday
is great.
"It should be a good race,
we're feeling pretty good," said
senior Christina Bax. "We've nev
er beaten Cal during my time at
Stanford and I'm a senior so this
is my last chance. So it is exciting
that this could be the year, and I
hope it is."
Last weekend, the Card com
peted against USC, with the 2VB

winning its second straight race
against the Trojans and the IVB
falling just short.
"Coming off a loss for the IV
[against USC], we're really fired up
to figure out how we can go faster
and win this weekend," Bax said.
"It's hard to lose, but at the same
time, it's good to lose because it mo
tivates you even more because you
don't want that feeling of losing any
more."
Finally, the No. 2 Stanford
women's lightweight team will go up
against the Cal 3VB and 4VB boats,
as Cal does not have a lightweight
team. The Card, however, already
gained experience against Cal's

openweight boats at the Pac-12
Challenge in early April. The IVB
loss to Cal's 3VB was one of their on
ly defeats of the season and the
Card are ready for a second shot at
the Bears.
"We've really been working over
the past couple of weeks at fine-tun
ing our race plan and seeing how we
can get off the start faster," said
sophomore Katherine Christel. "So
I'm really excited to start practicing
that before IRAs because we really
only have this regatta and then one
more after that before we go to na
tionals."
Stanford's lightweight team will
start competition for the day at 9:30
a.m. on Saturday, with the rest of the
races alternating between the men's
and women's teams until 11 a.m.
