# TITLE HOPES DASHED

### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 3 Stanford men's volley
ball team came up short against top
seeded Loyola-Chicago in the
NCAA title match on Saturday
evening, falling to the Ramblers in
four sets (25-17,19-25, 25-19, 25-15)
in front of a sold-out crowd of 4,485.
While the Cardinal fought hard,
Loyola-Chicago and its home court
advantage proved too much for
Stanford, which was seeking to win
its third national title in program
history. Stanford is now 2-3 in
NCAA championship matches.

Loyola-Chicago won its first ever
NCAA Championship and became
the first school to win an NCAA title
on its home court since Stanford in
2010, the last time the Cardinal won
the tournament. Loyola-Chicago
(29-1) had an outstanding season,
losing only one match, while Stan
ford (24-9) had a tougher time earli
er in the season but had an impres
sive 13-match winning streak com
ing into the postseason.
Loyola-Chicago hit its way to a
win on Saturday, posting a .452 hit
ting percentage as a team. The
Ramblers also outblocked the Cardi
nal 8.5 to 5.5 and had a better night
from the service line.
The first set was close at the
start, with the two teams going back
and forth in the opening points. But
the Ramblers began to push ahead,
hitting .696 for the set. After being
tied, two kills from Loyola put them
up 15-13 and set them on an eight
point run. Suddenly, the set was 23-
15 for the Ramblers. Especially key
to Loyola's first set success was the
service game of Thomas Jaeschke,
who had four straight points from
the service line. Loyola won the set

25-17, outhitting Stanford .696 to
.296. The set ended on a service er
ror by the Cardinal.
In the next set, Stanford tried to
put the first set behind it and came
out aggressively. The team went up
early in the set and had back-to-back
aces from sophomore setter James
Shaw to push it to a 14-9 lead over
the Ramblers. This set, Stanford
was the one to go on a ran, getting
seven points and forcing Loyola to
call a timeout. Although Loyola cut
the lead to six, Stanford won the sec
ond set 25-19, hitting much better
with a .444 percentage. Shaw had 21
assists in the second set alone. Sen
ior Eric Mochalski closed out the
second set with a kill.
With the match tied 1-1, the two
teams were on a mission to gain an
advantage in the match. The intensi
ty was high and the crowd was full of
energy. The Ramblers went up early
in the third, hitting an incredibly
high .857 in the opening points. De
spite impressive hitting by senior
Brian Cook and blocking by senior
Steven Irvin and sophomore Con
rad Kaminski, Stanford could only
cut Loyola's lead to one, never get
ting a lead in the third set. Loyola
won set three 25-19, putting the
Cardinal down 2-1 in the match.
Set four, which Stanford needed
to win to force a fifth set, was not
any better for the Cardinal, which
once again trailed early. Loyola
went on a 5-0 run to go up 13-6, put
ting any fifth-set hopes in doubt
early. Two Stanford errors then
built on Loyola's lead, with Stan
ford seeming less and less its nor
mally steady and confident self.
Loyola had a late ace to put it up 21-
12 with the offense running effi
ciently and without mistakes. Faced
with an insurmountable deficit,
Stanford lost the set and match on a
service error. The Cardinal also lost
the first set on a service error, even
though the team typically finds an
ally in its service game.
Stanford's offense was led once

again by senior All-American Brian
Cook in his last match for the Car
dinal. Cook has been a central part
of Stanford's success this season
and has helped to define Stanford
volleyball with smart, strong and
consistent play. He led the team in
kills for the 24th time this season
with 15 kills and a .243 hitting per
centage. Fellow senior All-Ameri
can Steven Irvin had 10 kills in the
match and four blocks. Kaminski,
who averages over a .500 hitting
percentage this season, hit .417 and
had seven kills. Shaw held the of
fense together and provided great
attack opportunities with his 39 as
sists. He also had two aces in the
match, something Stanford could
have benefited from having more of.
Both Cook and Shaw were selected
to the All-Tournament team.
Junior Cody Caldwell led the
Ramblers' offense with a double
double of 20 kills and 10 digs, earn
ing the tournament's Most Out
standing Player award. Caldwell hit

.562 in the match. Joe Smalzer and
Thomas Jaeschke also had double
doubles in the match with 12 kills
apiece. And Peter Hutz anchored
the offense with 47 assists, guiding
the team to its first national title.
Despite the disappointing out
come for the Cardinal on Saturday,
the team has much to be proud of.
Starting 6-7 in conference, Stanford
showed that a team truly can turn a
corner and redefine its season. The
team had a 13-match winning
streak, beating out top teams to earn
a berth to the NCAA Tournament.
Most recently, Stanford beat BYU in
the Final Four after having come up
short against the Cougars three
times earlier in the season.
Stanford has reminded the vol
leyball community that it is a strong
program with confidence and talent
that is only continuing to grow and
mature.
