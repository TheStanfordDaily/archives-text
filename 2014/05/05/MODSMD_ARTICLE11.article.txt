## Ninth title denied Cardinal fall short of ninth MPSF title in 10 years 
### KRISHNA BASSI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 20 Cardinal women's lacrosse
team fell short of its ninth Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) tournament
championship in 10 years against No. 15 Den
ver at the Pioneers' home field as Stanford
(14-4) lost to Denver (18-1) by a score of 14-
11. Stanford was the defending tournament
champion, as it beat Denver last year in the
MPSF tournament finals 7-6. However, this
year the final result was not in its favor.
Stanford has played Denver now six times
in the MPSF Tournament, with Stanford
coming out on top in the first five meetings.
However, this year, Denver ended the streak,
largely thanks to a powerful start to the
game. Denver came out fast with a strong of
fense that scored five goals in the first 10
minutes of the game.
The Cardinal fell into an early slump and
could not recover from that five-goal Pioneer
streak, as they fell behind by deficits of 5-0

and 9-2 and were never able to draw closer
than the final margin. However, senior at
tacker Rachel Ozer broke through for the
Cardinal in the ninth minute, and from that
point on Stanford outscored Denver 11-9.
Sophomore attacker Alexandra Crerend
helped give Stanford a boost in possession by
winning faee-offs, which helped the team
push to a 3-0 scoring run that brought the
Cardinal within 9-5 on a goal by sophomore
midfielder Lucy Dikeou with 1:21 left in the
first half. Denver, however, responded with a
3-0 scoring run of its own, retaking control of
the game just after halftime.
The Cardinal's offensive leaders were
clear, with junior midfielder and MPSF Play
er of the Year Hannah Farr and Ozer scoring
three goals apiece. Farr also tallied four
ground balls and caused two turnovers.
Dikeou contributed two goals, three ground
balls, three draw controls and caused a
turnover. Freshman midfielder Alex
Poplawski, freshman attacker Kelsey Mur
ray and senior midfielder Anna Kim scored
one goal each. Stanford closed out the scor
ing with a 5-1 run, including the goal by Kim
with 3:30 to go.
On the defensive end, Stanford
struggled to stop Denver's scoring.
Senior goalie Lyndsey Munoz
started the game and played about
22 minutes. She tallied two saves
before sophomore goalie Katie
Wiseman entered the game. She
finished out the game allowing
only four goals in her 37 minutes
and made seven saves. Addition
ally, sophomore defender Adri
enne Anderson caused three
turnovers.
Denver gave the Cardinal a lot
of trouble due to their offensive
diversity and depth. The Pioneers
had six players scoring, with jun
ior midfielder Kiki Boone, sopho
more midfielder Christa Reese
and sophomore attacker Rachael
McKinno each tallying hat tricks.
Boone also tallied nine draw con
trols and three ground balls. Jun
ior midfielder Racheal Dillon and
junior attacker Jill Remenapp
each scored two goals. Dillon won
four draw controls and two ground
balls. Senior midfielder Meredith

Harris additionally contributed
one goal and three assists.
Denver outshot Stanford 32-28,
while placing 23 shots on goal. The
Pioneers held a 19-9 advantage in
draw controls and edged the Cardi
nal 19-18 in ground balls.
For Denver, the defense was led
by redshirt junior goalie Hannah
Hook, who recorded nine saves.
Hook was named the MPSF Tour
nament MVP
With the win, the Pioneers
broke the record for the Universi
ty's longest winning streak with 16
games. Prior to the win, Denver
had gone 0-6 against Stanford in
the MPSF Tournament.
When the MPSF tournament
team was selected, three Stanford
players in Ozer, Farr and Anderson
were chosen for the MPSF All-
Tournament team.
Stanford will play No. 11 Duke
in the first round of the NCAA
Tournament on May 9 after earn
ing the at-large bid into the tourna
ment on Sunday night. The winner
will advance to the second round
and play the winner of the matchup
between Canisius and Penn.

(14-4) lost to Denver (18-1) by a score of 14-
11. Stanford was the defending tournament
champion, as it beat Denver last year in the
MPSF tournament finals 7-6. However, this
year the final result was not in its favor.
Stanford has played Denver now six times
in the MPSF Tournament, with Stanford
coming out on top in the first five meetings.
However, this year, Denver ended the streak,
largely thanks to a powerful start to the
game. Denver came out fast with a strong of
fense that scored five goals in the first 10
minutes of the game.
The Cardinal fell into an early slump and
could not recover from that five-goal Pioneer
streak, as they fell behind by deficits of 5-0

and 9-2 and were never able to draw closer
than the final margin. However, senior at
tacker Rachel Ozer broke through for the
Cardinal in the ninth minute, and from that
point on Stanford outscored Denver 11-9.
Sophomore attacker Alexandra Crerend
helped give Stanford a boost in possession by
winning faee-offs, which helped the team
push to a 3-0 scoring run that brought the
Cardinal within 9-5 on a goal by sophomore
midfielder Lucy Dikeou with 1:21 left in the
first half. Denver, however, responded with a
3-0 scoring run of its own, retaking control of
the game just after halftime.
The Cardinal's offensive leaders were
clear, with junior midfielder and MPSF Play
er of the Year Hannah Farr and Ozer scoring
three goals apiece. Farr also tallied four
ground balls and caused two turnovers.
Dikeou contributed two goals, three ground
balls, three draw controls and caused a
turnover. Freshman midfielder Alex
Poplawski, freshman attacker Kelsey Mur
ray and senior midfielder Anna Kim scored
one goal each. Stanford closed out the scor
ing with a 5-1 run, including the goal by Kim
with 3:30 to go.
On the defensive end, Stanford
struggled to stop Denver's scoring.
Senior goalie Lyndsey Munoz
started the game and played about
22 minutes. She tallied two saves
before sophomore goalie Katie
Wiseman entered the game. She
finished out the game allowing
only four goals in her 37 minutes
and made seven saves. Addition
ally, sophomore defender Adri
enne Anderson caused three
turnovers.
Denver gave the Cardinal a lot
of trouble due to their offensive
diversity and depth. The Pioneers
had six players scoring, with jun
ior midfielder Kiki Boone, sopho
more midfielder Christa Reese
and sophomore attacker Rachael
McKinno each tallying hat tricks.
Boone also tallied nine draw con
trols and three ground balls. Jun
ior midfielder Racheal Dillon and
junior attacker Jill Remenapp
each scored two goals. Dillon won
four draw controls and two ground
balls. Senior midfielder Meredith

Harris additionally contributed
one goal and three assists.

while placing 23 shots on goal. The
Pioneers held a 19-9 advantage in
draw controls and edged the Cardi
nal 19-18 in ground balls.

by redshirt junior goalie Hannah
