### KRISHNA BASSI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 20 Cardinal women's lacrosse
team fell short of its ninth Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) tournament
championship in 10 years against No. 15 Den
ver at the Pioneers' home field as Stanford
(14-4) lost to Denver (18-1) by a score of 14-
11. Stanford was the defending tournament
champion, as it beat Denver last year in the
MPSF tournament finals 7-6. However, this
year the final result was not in its favor.
Stanford has played Denver now six times
in the MPSF Tournament, with Stanford
coming out on top in the first five meetings.
However, this year, Denver ended the streak,
largely thanks to a powerful start to the
game. Denver came out fast with a strong of
fense that scored five goals in the first 10
minutes of the game.
The Cardinal fell into an early slump and
could not recover from that five-goal Pioneer
streak, as they fell behind by deficits of 5-0

and 9-2 and were never able to draw closer
than the final margin. However, senior at
tacker Rachel Ozer broke through for the
Cardinal in the ninth minute, and from that
point on Stanford outscored Denver 11-9.
Sophomore attacker Alexandra Crerend
helped give Stanford a boost in possession by
winning faee-offs, which helped the team
push to a 3-0 scoring run that brought the
Cardinal within 9-5 on a goal by sophomore
midfielder Lucy Dikeou with 1:21 left in the
first half. Denver, however, responded with a
3-0 scoring run of its own, retaking control of
the game just after halftime.
The Cardinal's offensive leaders were
clear, with junior midfielder and MPSF Play
er of the Year Hannah Farr and Ozer scoring
three goals apiece. Farr also tallied four
ground balls and caused two turnovers.
Dikeou contributed two goals, three ground
balls, three draw controls and caused a
turnover. Freshman midfielder Alex
Poplawski, freshman attacker Kelsey Mur
ray and senior midfielder Anna Kim scored
one goal each. Stanford closed out the scor
ing with a 5-1 run, including the goal by Kim
with 3:30 to go.
