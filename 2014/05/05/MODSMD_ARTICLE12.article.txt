## OP-ED The 						case for removing Searsville Dam 
### Kimberley Milligan 
As a Stanford grad, newspaper
headlines about my alma
mater frequently make me
proud. The University and its grad
uates are constantly featured for
winning academic awards, achiev
ing the impossible through techno
logical innovation and demonstrat
ing leadership that the entire world
will follow. In contrast, recent sto
ries about Stanford's Searsville
Dam and its detrimental impacts to
San Francisquito Creek give me
concern.
While Stanford has made strides
in its environmental management
policies, Searsville Dam remains a
blemish on Stanford's sustainability
record. This 65-foot dam, which is
owned and operated by the Univer
sity, is located on Stanford's Jasper
Ridge Biological Preserve, an area
that provides "a refuge to native
plants and animals," according to
the University. Ironically, the dam
blocks the migration of threatened
native steelhead trout that are pro
tected by the Endangered Species
Act. As a result, the University has
been sued by multiple organizations
seeking to protect these native fish
and alleging that Stanford is in vio
lation of the Endangered Species
Act.
To its credit, Stanford has taken
initial steps to address the problem.
The University is currently con
ducting a study to assess its man
agement options, including the pos
sibility of dam removal. It plans to
make a decision about whether or
not to remove Searsville Dam by
the end of 2014.
Dam removal is a proven
method for restoring degraded wa
tersheds. By removing the barrier,
dam removal restores the ecologi
cal and physical connectivity of the
creek and reestablishes the cold
water habitat that was drowned by
the reservoir. Numerous case stud
ies have shown that after dam re
moval is complete, invasive species
decrease and native migratory fish

return to the upper watershed, re
claiming their lost habitat. But fish
and wildlife aren't the only benefici
aries— dam removal also makes
people safer by removing aging in
frastructure that poses serious
risks to communities downstream.
Stanford asserts that it is dedi
cated to following core sustainabili
ty principles in all aspects of its op
erations, including its commitment
to "preserve and manage environ
mental resources to allow the func
tioning of natural ecosystems and
the long-term persistence of native
species." Searsville Dam is clearly
in direct conflict with Stanford's
own principles, and it undermines
the University's otherwise strong
reputation on sustainability issues.
I am hopeful that, before the
end of 2014,1 will open the newspa
per one morning and read about
Stanford's plan to not only remove
its dam and restore San Francisqui
to Creek, but also to study and
showcase the restoration so that
dam owners throughout the world
can join in following Stanford's
lead.
