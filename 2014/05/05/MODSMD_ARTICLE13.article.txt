## Ukraine: A question of history 
### Raven Jiang 
Be it the devout crusaders
whose convictions grew from
absolute faith, the American
G.I. who died on a beach in France
for the patriotic ideals of freedom
and democracy or a science fiction
writer who cynically set out to be
come rich by manufacturing a cult
of fawning worshippers every
actor in history believes in some
version of reality in which his ac
tions are justified to the extent that
right and wrong exist. It is only
right, then, that the unbelievers be
put to death for the glory of the
rightful God. It is only right for
good to triumph over evil. It is only
fair for the intelligent to exploit the
gullible and weak.
Assuming that the historical
past is fixed and not fluid and
moreover, that in the presence of all
relevant facts we somehow at long
last arrive at a common definition of
moral ethics then somewhere in
the complex history of Ukraine and
Russia exist a set of facts that can
tell us what is "right" and "wrong"
in an escalating conflict between
two distinct interpretations of the
Ukrainian soul. Unfortunately, the
past will always remain opaque to
us.
Are the people of Ukraine fight
ing for a cause that is truly their
own and not a power play in some
body's grand strategic chessboard?
Were the Ukrainians misled by fas
cists peddling Western propaganda
about an EU dream that cannot be?
Or were the ethnic Russians of east
ern Ukraine taken in by a narrative
woven by a Russian establishment
deeply nostalgic for the rose-tinted
memories of Soviet past?
If the Euromaidan movement's
occupation of government buildings
and its heated protests against
Yanukovych's security forces were
truly the power of popular democ
racy at work, then why are Luhan
sk and Donetsk the failure of police
authority to maintain public order?
Conversely, if the anti-Russian pro
testors were the Nazis of our time,
then why is Russia the one annex
ing Crimea under the overt pretext
of uniting its own people in a mod
ern-day Anschluss?
It is often said that history is
written by the victors, but what it
often neglects to mention is that vic
tory does not always come in the
form of diplomacy and military
might. The real war takes place be

neath the surface, at the level where
fact and fiction blur because human
memories are ephemeral and mal
leable, and human nature longs for
meaning and grand narratives.
When it comes to ethnic feuds and
historical disputes, what matters
most is not facts, but what people
remember as facts. No one wants
to be remembered for indiscrimi
nately killing innocent people, for
mass rape, for gulags, for terror
ism. Each of us wants to be the pro
moter of democracy, the liberator,
the national hero, the freedom
fighter.
In the era of the smartphone and
in a country where mobile Internet
access is often a higher priority
than good governance and social
justice, the troves of footage coming
out of Ukraine are showing us a side
of history that most of us non-histo
rians were never forced to confront.
This is not textbook history in its
packaged consumer-ready form;
this is raw undigested history in all
its messy complexities and humani
ty.
We see the genuine hopeless
face of a Russian lady living in east
ern Ukraine who desperately cries
"Nazis," tears flowing from her
eyes as she watches a column of ar
mored vehicles loyal to the pro-
Western central government roll to
wards her revolting town. We see
the pro-unity elderly men carrying
Ukraine flags, trying to peacefully
march in Donetsk in support of
their homeland, only to be beaten
up by young men wearing Russian
tricolors who think that the only vi
able future for their city is to return
home to Mother Russia. We
watched the live streams of pro-uni
ty and pro-Russian protestors en
gaging in street skirmishes in
Odessa that eventually resulted in
the pro-Russian forces being
trapped in a burning building in
which at least 30 perished. Which
side is just? This is a question of
history and there are no convincing
answers.

Most of the people on both sides
of the divide see themselves as good
people. They simply want the best
future for the people they love. But
because their world views are the
products of entirely incompatible
chains of narratives, their divergent
visions of the future and their
strong desire to do what is right
force them to fight. What we want
from history is a romantic story of
good triumphing over evil, the hero
ic over the wicked, the right over
the wrong, but the real human
tragedy is that some of the worst
deeds we as humans do to each oth
er are simply the result of a sincere
belief in our own subjective reality.
There is real grassroots support
for independence and closer ties
with Russia amongst the civilian
population in eastern Ukraine, and
it would be foolish and unfair to dis
miss all of it as Russian propagan
da. It is difficult with a Western lens
not to question the sincerity of
Russian intents in Ukraine, and
that may very well be wise, but one
should be careful not to get too
caught up in the bubble that one
constructs for oneself.
To this end, I recommend the in
dependent reporting done by VICE
News on the ground in Ukraine
since the beginning of the protests.
While reporter Simon Ostrovsky
clearly brought with him a Western
perspective, he did an excellent job
of lending a voice to the insurgents
in Donetsk and Slavyansk who see
themselves as conscientious objec
tors against an illegal, non-demo
cratic government. Regardless of
what you think of these pro-Russian
activists, listen to what they have to
say. In a naturally pro-Western
country, there is something pro
foundly enlightening about actually
listening to the other side of the di
vide.
