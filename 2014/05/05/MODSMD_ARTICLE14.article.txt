# FROM THE OPINIONS DESK
## The
						future of Eastern Europe 
### Winston Shi 
In an op-ecl running today, Raven
Jiang 'l5 writes that the Stan
ford community mainly
Westerners should pay close at
tention to the issues underlying the
struggle for control of eastern
Ukraine. "This is a question of his
tory and there are no convincing an
swers," Jiang contends. "There is
something profoundly enlightening
about actually listening to the other
side of the divide."

What Jiang has to say is valu
able. It's important to remember
that the nations that are considered
our rivals, or worse, enemies, have
them own history, their own histori
cal narratives and their own per
spectives on how we live our lives.
History is complex, and it's tempt
ing to agree with Jiang that "there
are no convincing answers."
Indeed, we all must pay heed to
the fact that history may not judge
our actions fairly. "I cannot do fair
justice to the cultural underpin
nings of the Crimean crisis," I ad
mitted when Russia invaded the

Crimean Peninsula two months ago.
But even today, I wouldn't change
my stance. In part, that is because,
as the above quote explains, I was
not attempting to gauge the senti
ments of the people within
Ukraine's borders. I was arguing
that America should defend its red
lines and treaty commitments, and
if it could not, then avoid making
these agreements in the first place.
My column was about the diplo
matic ramifications of our stance in
Eastern Europe of the potential
risks we face when we extend our
treaty commitments into areas that
we are not prepared to defend.
Two months later, what have we
done?
We obligated ourselves by treaty
to defend Ukraine's borders; we
have not done so in the Crimea, but
so far Kiev controls the rest of the
country. And while diplomacy in
theory would mandate that all
treaties are created equal, in recent
weeks, now that our friends in NA
TO a far more critical treaty in
geopolitical terms have spoken
up, we have put boots on the ground
in Poland and the Baltic States.
Mind you, the total commitment
is only 600 men, a force that by itself
would never be enough to defend
against an actual Russian invasion.
But the fact that America has placed
men in Eastern Europe implies that
if Russia wants to attack the nations
housing them, it may have to shed
American blood. If 600 American
soldiers died as a result, the result
would likely be a far greater war
than Russia would be willing to ac
cept. There's a reason we have
placed troops there and not in
Ukraine: President Obama evalu
ates that his actions are both in with
in the scope of his abilities and in our
national interest. He made the call;
we must hope that it is the right one.
But Jiang doesn't ask whether
that is true; to this point, we've been
asking different questions. Jiang
asks a fundamental question a
normative question. He questions
the validity of the very attitude of
the American diplomatic narrative.
And now that he brings it up, I must
discuss why the United States con
siders its commitment to Eastern
Europe worthwhile.

The first thing to note is that the
United States foreign policy estab
lishment is not monolithic. After the
end of the Cold War, when the
American narrative had finally seen
its triumph over socialism, George
Kennan firmly opposed the expan
sion of NATO into Eastern Europe.
"I think it is the beginning of a new
cold war," Kennan predicted. And
although he was said to have sup
ported expansion in 1997, Henry
Kissinger nevertheless opposed
adding Ukraine to the alliance.
What justifies our military guar
antee, then, is not necessarily
geopolitics, for as we've seen, there
are excellent geopolitical arguments
against expanding our military com
mitments. We are in Eastern Eu
rope in large part because of what
Jiang explicitly wants to dissuade:
our own assurance, born out of rev
olution and forged in both war and
peace, that America is on the right
side of history.
With all due respect to a man
who has written a tremendously
thoughtful piece and, having
lived abroad for many years, I know
that it expresses a sentiment that
many people share I cannot

agree with Jiang. I reject the funda
mental yet unsaid premise of Jiang's
piece that the fact that other peo
ples may disagree implies a kind of
moral equivalence.
True, Jiang is not wrong when he
points out that the Euromaidan
movement that eventually toppled
President Yanukovych was a revolt,
just as the anti-government unrest
in Luhansk and Donetsk also consti
tutes a revolt. The difference is,
then, that Euromaidan at least in
principle supports away of life
that will ultimately benefit the
Ukrainian people more so than that
of its discontents.

The op-ed implies but does not
say that we should tread lightly re
garding issues that we do not fully
understand, and indeed America has
frequently burned itself when it has
tried to intervene with too heavy a
hand. But the tone of the piece
seems to imply that because of this
fact, we should keep out of these is
sues entirely. Even if that is not what
Jiang believes, it's a belief that exists
and that I firmly intend to dissuade.

What, then, happens to Ukraine?
Do we wash our hands of the con
flict?

To a certain extent, a hands-off
approach seems like the best option
available to us. Despite the efforts of
Charles Krauthammer, we're almost
certainly not going to give Ukraine
the sort of boots-on-the-ground
guarantee that we have extended to
NATO. If Ukraine threatens to split
in fashion that can be managed
that is, if the counter-Euromaidan
revolts trigger irrevocable tensions
but do not immediately devolve into
a civil war then a split will hap
pen: Realist diplomacy isn't just
about what we should achieve but al
so what we can achieve, and Presi
dent Obama does not seem intent on
imposing an equilibrium on Ukraine
that he doesn't feel he can enforce.
The American people have made
their judgment that the geopolitical
considerations at stake do not justi
fy intervention; after Crimea, Oba
ma has not drawn any more red
lines. And there are clearly plenty of
ways to express our distaste in more
graduated terms.
But there are also times when
purely advancing our national inter
est may run contrary to our moral
character. While the rumors of anti-
Semitic policies in eastern Ukraine
have been greatly exaggerated, the
Jewish community in Odessa has
considered evacuating its children
from the city. I say this not to imply
that any pro-Russian Eastern
Ukrainian state will bring pogroms
back to Eastern Europe. But the
many times that America has
bombed countries or otherwise in
tervened for similar, primarily
moral reasons â€”in Bosnia, in So
malia, in Libya and elsewhere
show both that we have principles
beyond geopolitics, and moreover,
that our moral beliefs are an impor
tant, albeit intangible, part of our
power. There is a reason why even
though President Obama almost
certainly won't intervene, he hasn't
ruled it out. I don't know what Oba
ma or the American collective con
sciousness would consider unaccept
able, but there is a point where,
from a moral standpoint, we will
stick to our guns.
And while we may be tempted to
embrace moral indifference if not
outright equivalency the United
States ultimately remains bound to
the factors that created it. America
is the one remaining great power
that was explicitly founded in serv
ice of an idea, and we ignore our
principles at our peril.
