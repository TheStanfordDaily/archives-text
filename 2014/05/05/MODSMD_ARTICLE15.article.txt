# WINS IN WESTWOOD
## 
### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
Forty-one games into its regular
season, Stanford's baseball team (21-
20, 9-12 Pac-12) has crossed the .500
threshold for the first time this year,
reaching its high-water mark after
taking two out of three against
UCLA (23-21-1, 10-11) in southern
California. While freshman pitchers
entered the series having thrown 57
percent of the Cardinal's innings
thus far, the older arms dominated
the Bruins' offense this weekend,
spurring Stanford to 5-0 and 5-2
wins on Saturday and Sunday after
it dropped Friday's contest 7-2.
"It's big," said head coach Mark
Marquess. "You want to win the
league, but realistically that's not go
ing to happen for us, so we have to
try to win every game that we can.
Every win that we can get is big for
us."

The Cardinal find themselves in
an odd position, as they own an aver
age regular season record and a sub
par conference record, yet were still
ranked 34th in last Monday's RPI
release due to their strength of
schedule. With 12 games remaining
in the regular season, they need to
maintain around a .500 record to re
main in consideration by the selec
tion committee for an at-large bid in
to the NCAA Tournament.
Freshman Cal Quantrill got the
series off to a rough start on Friday

night, allowing six runs in the bot
tom of the first inning after Stanford
had jumped out to a 1-0 lead in the
top half. Eleven UCLA hitters
stepped to the plate, as they had six
hits, including four singles, and a
walk in the rally.
That was all the Bruins needed,
as their ace, sophomore James Ka
prielian, shut down the Cardinal
bats. He allowed just one run on five
hits and struck out 10 over 6.2 in
nings. Stanford stranded 11 runners
in the game and went 2-for-ll (.187)
with runners in scoring position in
the 7-2 loss.
Though Quantrill was able to set
tle in after the first, allowing just one
more baserunner over the next four
innings, the start continued a down
ward trend for the freshman. Over

his last four starts, he is 0-3 with a
5.70 ERA (15 ER/23.2 IP) after going
2-0 with a 0.70 ERA (3 ER/38.1 IP)
over his previous six starts.
Junior John Hochstattei; on the
other hand, has emerged over the
last month as the Cardinal's go-to
starting pitcher after being put in the
bullpen to start the season. He threw
his second consecutive complete
game on Saturday, this one a five-hit
shutout. He took advantage of the
conference-leading defense behind
him, inducing 15 ground balls as the
Cardinal went errorless in the con
test.

Entering this weekend,
Hochstatter ranked third with a 1.05
ERA in conference games, which im
proved to 0.83 after his Saturday
start. He has won each of his four
starts this season, allowing just four
earned runs over 28.2 innings for a
1.26 ERA.

On Sunday, sophomore Logan
James made his first start of the sea
son, replacing freshman Brett
Hanewich in the rotation, at least
temporarily. James, who had pitched
four shutout innings against Pacific
in his last outing on Ttiesday, contin
ued to pitch well, holding the UCLA
offense to one run over four innings.
The well-rested bullpen finished
the last five innings strongly, as sen
ior A.J. Vanegas and freshman
Christopher Castellanos allowed
just one run for the remainder of the
game. Vanegas, who was making his

first appearance since allowing his
first earned runs in a loss last Satur
day against Cal, got the call with
runners on first and second with no
outs in the fifth. He retired three
straight, stranding the runners and
maintaining Stanford's 2-1 lead at
the time. Vanegas finished with
three scoreless innings and Castel
lanos escaped a jam in the ninth to
secure a 5-2 Cardinal win and series
victory.
The Stanford offense held up its
end of the bargain, too, in the final
two games of the series. It tallied 20
hits and went 6-for-15 combined with
runners in scoring position on Satur
day and Sunday. Two-out hitting was
also key for the Cardinal, as they
went 5-for-13 with four RBIs in those
situations on Sunday.

Senior Alex Blandino rocked his
conference-leading seventh homer of
the year on Sunday, while sophomore
Zach Hoffpauir went 3-for-3 with two
RBIs in the game as part of a 5-for
-10 weekend. Junior Austin Slater
went 4-for-4 with two runs scored.
"My swing felt good. Honestly,
when I stepped in the box, I wasn't
thinking about much," said Slater,
who went 7-for-ll with two RBIs in
the series. "I'm just seeing the ball
really well."
Next up for the Cardinal is a
matchup against Santa Clara on
Riesday at Sunken Diamond before
they head to Arizona for a weekend
series against the Wildcats.
