# CARD NOTCH BIG UPSET
## 
### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While many people travel to Los
Angeles for the beautiful southern
California weather, the Stanford
Cardinal softball team traveled to
Los Angeles for its last "business
trip" of the regular season with the
goal of silencing the barrage of
doubts directed towards Stanford
softball. With a win over UCLA on
their competitor's home turf in the
first game of the series over the Bru
ins, the Cardinal at least quieted the
onslaught of reservations.
Stanford (29-23, 4-17 Pac-12)
notched its biggest win of the season
this weekend, stunning No. 2 UCLA
in Westwood on Friday night to give
new life to its postseason hopes. Fri
day's 12-9 victory over the Bruins
gave the Cardinal then- first road win
over a top-five squad since 2011,
while also providing a huge boost to
the Card's RPI. The Cardinal had an
RPI of 49 entering this weekend's se
ries, but the victory over UCLA, with
its RPI of 3, will likely vault the Car
dinal past several fellow bubble
teams when this week's rankings are
released today.
Although the Cardinal would lose
their final two games in Los Angeles,
it nevertheless was a very successful
weekend for Stanford, given the
quality of the opponent in UCLA. Af
ter Wednesday's 2-1 victory over
Saint Mary's, freshman Kylie Soren
son talked about how the Cardinal
would be traveling to Los Angeles
with the mindset of shocking people.
On Friday night, the Card certainly
stunned the fans in attendance at
Easton Stadium, jumping all over
Bruins starter Ally Carda in the first
two innings to run out to an early 8-3
lead.

Carda, a 2013 First Team NFCA
All-West Region selection, struggled
mightily in locating her changeup,
her marquee pitch, against the Car
dinal. This inability to effectively uti
lize the changeup, coupled with the
Card's strikingly aggressive ap
proach at the plate, ended Carda's
night after only 1.1 innings of work.
In chasing Cai'da from the circle,
Stanford recorded four of the seven
hits charged to the Elk Grove, Cali
fornia native by teeing off on her first
delivery.

The Cardinal's success at the
plate continued with Carda's exit for
reliever Jessica Hall. Hall was
tagged for four more runs on five hits
and six free passes, as the Card put
the Bruins away with their offensive
performance. Although freshman
Madi Schreyer would yield five runs
with two outs in the bottom of the
seventh inning, UCLA was ultimate
ly unable to recover from its eight
ran deficit entering the bottom of the
frame, with the Card prevailing in
the 21-ran slugfest.
Unfortunately for Stanford, the

Cardinal were unable to sustain their
form from Friday in the last two
games, putting up a combined two
runs on nine total hits. On Saturday
afternoon, Carda bounced back from
her disastrous Friday start to pitch a
three-hit shutout, as the Bruins
routed the Card 9-0 in five innings.
Sunday's matinee was a tight
pitcher's duel for most of the game,
as Stanford junior Tylyn Wells and
Hall went toe-to-toe for most of the
afternoon. Wells, who had not
pitched in three years before being
called into action this season after
the losses of Carley Hoover and
Nyree White, pitched the game of
her life against the Bruins. The Con
cord, California, product tied a ca
reer-high for innings pitched in a sin
gle game with her 5.2 innings of work
on Sunday in stifling a potent Bruins
lineup.
While the Bruins entered this
past week with the ninth-best batting
average in the nation with a .337
mark, Wells was masterful at scatter
ing the Bruins' hits, inducing 11 fly

outs and forcing UCLA to strand
seven runners on base. However, af
ter calling time in the middle of an at
bat against Carda while seemingly
showing some signs of fatigue, Wells
gave up three runs with two outs in
the bottom of the sixth inning, break
ing the 2-2 tie.
Although Wells would take an un
fortunate loss in the 5-2 defeat on
Sunday, the Carondelet High School
graduate had a fantastic weekend
both in the circle and at the plate. On
offense, Wells led the Cardinal in bat
ting average and slugging percent
age with a .714 mark, while tying for
the team lead in total bases with five.
The first-year starter also scored a
run and stole a base in helping to
pace the Card's effort this weekend.
Senior Erin Ashby also had an
impressive weekend for Stanford, as
the La Crescenta, California, prod
uct had an outstanding series in her
southern California homecoming.
Ashby hit .444 against the Bruins,
while tying for the high mark in total
bases with Wells and sophomore
Kayla Bonstrom. She also slugged
.556 with an extra-base hit and two
runs scored.
Stanford returns to action on
Thursday evening for the beginning
of its final series of the regular sea
son against Pac-12 bottom dweller
Oregon State (16-29, 3-16 Pac-12).
The Cardinal and Beavers will
square off at 7 p.m. on Thursday be
fore a Friday evening contest at 5:30
p.m. and the regular season finale at
1:30 p.m. on Saturday afternoon. All
three games will be aired on the Pac
-12 Networks.
