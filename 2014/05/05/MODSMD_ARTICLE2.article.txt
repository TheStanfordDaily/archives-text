## Researchers study habits of hygiene Monitoring hand-washing could improve global health 
### NITISH KULKARNI DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Researchers from the Woods In
stitute for the Environment have
found that monitoring hand-wash
ing practices could benefit global
disease prevention efforts.
The study employed video and
in-person monitoring at four public
schools in the Kibera slum area in
Nairobi, Kenya. Research associate
Amy Pickering, the study's pri
mary author, emphasized the diffi
culties of collecting precise data
and noted that given that sub
jects were aware of the presence of
monitors and camera the inten
sity of effects witnessed may have
been dampened.
"It's difficult to measure accu
rate rates of hand-washing because
people are likely to tell you they
washed their hands even when they
did not due to social norms around
hand-washing," Pickering said.
The research showed that stu
dents at schools equipped with soap
and water were 1.3 times more like
ly to wash their hands under video
surveillance and in-person observa
tion than when under in-person ob
servation alone.
Additionally, hand washing
rates were found to be 23 percent
higher in situations when children
washed hands together, a phenome
non that researchers attributed to
the psychological effects of peer
pressure.
The study promises better-tar
geted efforts for hygiene in low
and middle-income countries.
"Hopefully video surveillance
will be added to the toolbox for ac
curately measuring hand hygiene
behavior, thus improving monitor
ing and evaluation of hand hygiene
interventions around the world,"
Pickering said.
Pickering emphasized the im
portance of new studies to verify
the accuracy of the results of the
experiment.
"It would be great to do a blind
ed study in which subjects were
not aware of the cameras," she
said. "This will ensure that the
captured behavior was not influ
enced by the presence of the cam
eras."
