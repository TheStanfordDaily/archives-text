# Lack of faculty diversity cause for concern
## Recent tenure denial for professor prompts discussion 
### ALEX ZIVKOVIC DESK EDITOR 
Last Thursday night, the Stanford Asian
American Activism Committee (SAAAC) held a
town hall discussion that sought to address con
cerns over faculty diversity and help plan a cam
paign calling on the University to make changes
to its hiring and tenure processes.
The meeting followed the recent denial of
tenure to Assistant Professor of English Stephen
Sohn, a decision that prompted the circulation of
a petition calling on administrators to reconsider
the decision and the voicing of more general con
cerns about the tenure process.
Thanh Nguyen 'l4 MA 'l4, one of Sohn's ad
visees, began the meeting by discussing past
tenure denial cases that dealt with questions of
studying diversity in academia, including Profes
sor of History Estelle Freedman, Akhil Gupta,
Robert Warrior and Lora Romero.
Freedman's bid for tenure in 1982 was initially
denied because her work was described as too fo
cused on women and women's issues, according to
Co Tran 'l7, one of her current students.
"Now, feminist studies is an established field
at almost all universities," Tran said.
According to Tran, Freedman has urged her
students to not internalize the judgment but
rather to recognize discrimination for what it is.
Freedman lent her support to the movement sup
porting reopening Sohn's tenure decision as a
means of supporting the academic pursuit of eth
nic studies and issues of diversity.
Sohn has focused largely on exploring less
popular topics including queer theory in Asian
American literature and speculative fiction
which Nguyen framed as vital to academia given
their novelty.
The sensitivity of Sohn's case is further exac
erbated by the small size of the Asian American
Studies program in terms of faculty and, conse
quently, course offerings. Several students at the
meeting expressed concern over the future of the
program at Stanford, particularly if fewer diverse
faculty are made available to teach these courses.
In particular, some students noted that while
the undergraduate population of Stanford is 41
percent white, 74 percent of faculty are described
as "non-minority."
Though a Faculty Diversity Initiative exists,
some students, including Nguyen, criticized it for
being unclear and as having had little notable suc
cess in hiring and then retaining minority profes
sors.
Melvin Boone 'l4 criticized the program for
devoting insufficient attention to the retention of
professors, noting that many minority professors
are hired and then fired later.
SAAAC is currently organizing letter-writing
campaigns to Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D.
'B2 over Sohn's failure to receive tenure. Howev
er, the group also expressed their intent of taking
on diversity issues in general and incorporating
the work of other groups on cam
pus.
However, their first goal re
mains prompting the University

towards reconsidering Sohn's bid
for tenure, according to Sammie
Wills 'l6. Following that, the
group plans to ask the University
to increase transparency in the
tenure process and grant more
funding to community centers.
