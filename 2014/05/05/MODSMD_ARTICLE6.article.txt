As part of its course WSP 172: "Coffee: From
Tree to Beans to Brew and Everything in Be
tween," Stanford Continuing Studies hosted and
organized the Stanford Coffee Symposium, an ed
ucational and tasting event situated outside of
Green Library, on Saturday morning.
The event, which offered a continuation from
the class' content, aimed to help attendees learn
more about coffee's role in the economy, history,
biology and brewing techniques and varieties.
The coffee symposium was the result of 18
months of thought and planning, according to
Greg Sherwin, one of the event's co-organizers.
Professor of Biology Virginia Walbot '67 had pre
viously invited Sherwin to create an event that
Walbot had arranged at Stanford a few years pri
or.
"[lt was an event] for chocolate," he said.

nections with Latin American
Studies, economics, biology and so
on. It is a showcase for academia as
well as industry and consumers
about coffee, interest in coffee and
all the factors it touches on."
The coffee symposium included
offering attendees samples of differ
ent kinds of professionally barista
brewed coffees and coffee bever
ages. Samples included freshly
brewed coffees from Bay Area cof
fee houses such as Cafe Venetia,
Blue Bottle Coffee and Barefoot
Coffee Roasters. Coupa Cafe was
also one of the vendors offering
samples and tasting.
"In this event, we are here to
showcase different coffee grounds
and brewing methods," said Julio
Cesar, who works at Coupa Cafe
and who represented the chain at
the event.
"Coupa Cafe is coffee from

Venezuela the beans come
straight from Venezuela," Cesar
said. "Here in the Bay Area, we
were the first coffee shop to serve
authentic Venezuelan coffee."
Sherwin explained that one of
the goals of the event was to help
educate attendees about the flavors
and varieties of coffees, in addition
to other issues related to biology
and agriculture.
"You can't just talk about coffee
and not have it these guys are
here to help us enjoy it as well,"
Sherwin said, in reference to the
representatives from coffee houses
and their sample selections at the
event.
One of the other highlights of the
event was a coffee tasting program
run by Blue Bottle Coffee, a famous
San Francisco coffee company.
Stephen Vick, the coffee buyer at
Blue Bottle Coffee, was one of the
many representatives arranging
the event.
"This portion of the event is a
tasting event," he said. "We're going
to be tasting three very different
coffees that are processed in differ

ent ways. There is a whole lot of fac
tors that affect how coffee tastes,
from how it's grown, to the soil, to
the variety."
The tasting program was cen
tered around a blind tasting of three
different coffees and culminated in a
talk on the properties of coffee and
the nature and function of different
brewing techniques.
"The idea is to, at the end of the
day, talk about the properties of the
coffee," Vick said.
The event sold out, drawing a
large crowd of Stanford community
members, students and local resi
dents. Sherwin attributed the popu
larity of the event to an increased
interest in high-value coffee.
"In the last 12 years, [specialty
and high-end coffee] has really
blossomed because people have re
alized that there really is some
thing to higher-value coffee," he
said. "I think this event represents
a lot of that and what better coffee
could be."
