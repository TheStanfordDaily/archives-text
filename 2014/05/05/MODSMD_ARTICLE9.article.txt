## Mike Trout, saving the face of baseball 
### Michael Peterson 
God looked down upon
Major League Base
ball one day and saw
that it was no longer
good. Long gone were
the times when the face of the game
and former emissary for baseball,
Derek Jeter, stood near the top of
baseball statistics in any category oth
er than age. Yet again, baseball's popu
larity dropped, creating the largest de
crease in interest among fans for any
sport over the last 30 years. Wreckage
from the steroid era still tarnished the
league as more superstars became
embroiled in scandals, and baseball
seemed unable to escape.
God's favorite sport has always
been baseball other than the times
when Tim Tebow played in the NFL,
of course. He decided to fix baseball
for the good of mankind and the rabid
baseball fans that had grown weary of
player after player giving in to steroid
use. So what happened next?
God sent Mike Trout to save the
game of baseball.
You had to know there was a rea
son Mike Trout was on the Angels of
all teams. Did you really think that a
player of his caliber once com
pared to former middle linebacker
Brian Urlacher by a scout but still
one of the fastest players in the
league—would fall all the way to
25th in the MLB Draft without di
vine intervention?
Since he's arrived, Trout has
brought a spark back to baseball.
Despite being only 22 years old, he's
clearly become the new face of base
ball, and for good reason. In his first
two full seasons in the league, Trout
generated 19.9 wins above replace
ment (WAR). His counterpart and
the man who beat him out in the AL

MVP voting the past two years,
Miguel Cabrera, took until his sixth
full season in order to reach the
same number.
It's easy to sift through Mike
Trout's numbers and compare him
to the all-time greats. As a rookie,
he was the first player ever to hit 30
home runs, steal 45 bases and score
125 runs in a season, one in which he
only played 139 games. Only 13 po
sition players have ever recorded
10.5 WAR in a season, like Trout did
his rookie year, and they are all in
the Hall of Fame.

However, even with his transcen
dent talent, Trout plays the game
hard, like it's meant to be played.
You'll never see Trout fail to run out
a ground ball to the bag or lazily
chase a pop fly, unlike some other
stars throughout the league. Base
ball is scattered with stars that
sometimes seem to take days or
plays off but still get paid $240 mil
lion (see: Robinson Cano). Some
times those players come off as con
descending, raining the perception
of the hard-working athletes and de
tracting from the overall popularity
of the game.
Back in the early 1980s, the
NBA was in a similar rat as baseball
faces now, stuck behind other pro
fessional sports in popularity. One
man by the name of Michael Jordan

changed that and took the NBA to
new heights, resulting in the mas
sive attention boost that has it
where it is today the second most
popular sport among younger
Americans and increasingly beating
baseball in television ratings. In the
mid-19905, Tiger Woods did the
same for golf, and as demonstrated
by the rapid drop of ticket prices for
The Masters after Woods bowed
out, the sport leans heavily on him.
What Jordan and Woods were to
basketball and golf, respectively,
Trout is becoming to baseball. I
have yet to meet a baseball fan that
doesn't admire Trout. Even non
baseball fans are beginning to pay
attention to baseball because of the
hysteria surrounding Trout. It's be
coming cool to be a baseball fan

Maybe I over-exaggerated base
ball's loss in popularity, but at least
among younger Americans, base
ball is clearly no longer at the top.
Football, basketball and even now
soccer are at least as popular as
baseball in America among teens,
with football and basketball being
far more popular, at least according
to an ESPN study.
But with Trout, excitement has
returned to baseball because he
continues to defy baseball logic with
his performance. Rarely does a
prospect as hyped as Trout (former
ly the No. 1 prospect in the minor
leagues) live up to the billing. Never
has such a hyped prospect blown
away all expectations in the manner
that Trout has.

Who knows what's in store for
baseball's best player multiple
MVP awards, four home runs in a
game, the all-time runs record or 50
home runs and 50 stolen bases in a
season, nothing seems out of the
question at this point. And that's
why he continues to spike interest in
baseball —it seems like there is
nothing he cannot accomplish.
If you needed a reason to get ex
cited about baseball, well you've got
it. Mike Trout's here to reinvigorate
baseball, one stat at a time.

er than age. Yet again, baseball's popu
larity dropped, creating the largest de
crease in interest among fans for any
sport over the last 30 years. Wreckage
from the steroid era still tarnished the
league as more superstars became
embroiled in scandals, and baseball
seemed unable to escape.
God's favorite sport has always
been baseball other than the times
when Tim Tebow played in the NFL,
of course. He decided to fix baseball
for the good of mankind and the rabid
baseball fans that had grown weary of
player after player giving in to steroid
use. So what happened next?
God sent Mike Trout to save the
game of baseball.
You had to know there was a rea
son Mike Trout was on the Angels of
all teams. Did you really think that a
player of his caliber once com
pared to former middle linebacker
Brian Urlacher by a scout but still
one of the fastest players in the
league—would fall all the way to
25th in the MLB Draft without di
vine intervention?
Since he's arrived, Trout has
brought a spark back to baseball.
Despite being only 22 years old, he's
clearly become the new face of base
ball, and for good reason. In his first
two full seasons in the league, Trout
generated 19.9 wins above replace
ment (WAR). His counterpart and
the man who beat him out in the AL

MVP voting the past two years,
Miguel Cabrera, took until his sixth
full season in order to reach the
same number.
It's easy to sift through Mike
Trout's numbers and compare him
to the all-time greats. As a rookie,
he was the first player ever to hit 30
home runs, steal 45 bases and score
125 runs in a season, one in which he
only played 139 games. Only 13 po
sition players have ever recorded
10.5 WAR in a season, like Trout did
his rookie year, and they are all in
the Hall of Fame.

However, even with his transcen
dent talent, Trout plays the game
hard, like it's meant to be played.
You'll never see Trout fail to run out
a ground ball to the bag or lazily
chase a pop fly, unlike some other
stars throughout the league. Base
ball is scattered with stars that
sometimes seem to take days or
plays off but still get paid $240 mil
lion (see: Robinson Cano). Some
times those players come off as con
descending, raining the perception
of the hard-working athletes and de
tracting from the overall popularity
of the game.
Back in the early 1980s, the
NBA was in a similar rat as baseball
faces now, stuck behind other pro
fessional sports in popularity. One
man by the name of Michael Jordan

changed that and took the NBA to
new heights, resulting in the mas
sive attention boost that has it
where it is today the second most
popular sport among younger
Americans and increasingly beating
baseball in television ratings. In the
mid-19905, Tiger Woods did the
same for golf, and as demonstrated
by the rapid drop of ticket prices for
The Masters after Woods bowed
out, the sport leans heavily on him.
What Jordan and Woods were to
basketball and golf, respectively,
Trout is becoming to baseball. I
have yet to meet a baseball fan that
doesn't admire Trout. Even non
baseball fans are beginning to pay
attention to baseball because of the
hysteria surrounding Trout. It's be
coming cool to be a baseball fan

Maybe I over-exaggerated base
ball's loss in popularity, but at least
among younger Americans, base
ball is clearly no longer at the top.
Football, basketball and even now
soccer are at least as popular as
baseball in America among teens,
with football and basketball being
far more popular, at least according
to an ESPN study.
But with Trout, excitement has
returned to baseball because he
continues to defy baseball logic with
his performance. Rarely does a
prospect as hyped as Trout (former
ly the No. 1 prospect in the minor
leagues) live up to the billing. Never
has such a hyped prospect blown
away all expectations in the manner
that Trout has.

Who knows what's in store for
baseball's best player multiple
MVP awards, four home runs in a
game, the all-time runs record or 50
home runs and 50 stolen bases in a
season, nothing seems out of the
question at this point. And that's
why he continues to spike interest in
baseball —it seems like there is
nothing he cannot accomplish.
If you needed a reason to get ex
cited about baseball, well you've got
it. Mike Trout's here to reinvigorate
baseball, one stat at a time.

ideas for his third child's name after

God looked down upon
Major League Base
ball one day and saw
that it was no longer
good. Long gone were
the times when the face of the game
and former emissary for baseball,
Derek Jeter, stood near the top of
