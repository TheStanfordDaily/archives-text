## Pushing towards a title Stanford sweeps PCCSC event 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
Stanford sailing, ranked first
in the nation in co-ed fleet and
team racing and fifth in women's
fleet, finished conference cham
pionships this past weekend with
a first place finish in the team
event, sweeping all nine races
and qualifying for nationals in
the team event in one month.
Stanford has finished first in
the PCCSC Championships for
all three sailing events, including
the co-ed and female fleet
events, in addition to team rac
ing.
Fleet racing is what most
would consider "traditional sail
ing," with each sailor competing
as an individual against 17 others
to get through the course as
quickly as possible.
"The goal [of team racing] is
to work together to get in the
best combination to win, so to do
that we have a whole playbook.
Let's say I'm sailing and my
teammate is behind, I can trap
the competitor and let my team
mate pass to get ahead and get
into a better combination," said
senior Tally Buckstaff. "It really
involves working together and
talking and figuring out how to
get our team in the best situation
possible. So it's very dynamic
and you have to work well with
your teammates, so that's why
it's our favorite event."
Team racing involved three
Stanford boats, each with two
sailors, going up against a group
of three boats from its competi
tor. The goal is to get all three
boats into the best sequence so
that they all finish near the top.
It boils down to using the rules
and concepts of fleet racing in
combination with coordinating
and working with two other
boats to maximize their score at
the finish line.
