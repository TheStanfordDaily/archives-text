# SAILING
## Pushing towards a title Stanford sweeps PCCSC event 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
Stanford sailing, ranked first
in the nation in co-ed fleet and
team racing and fifth in women's
fleet, finished conference cham
pionships this past weekend with
a first place finish in the team
event, sweeping all nine races
and qualifying for nationals in
the team event in one month.
Stanford has finished first in
the PCCSC Championships for
all three sailing events, including
the co-ed and female fleet
events, in addition to team rac
ing.
Fleet racing is what most
would consider "traditional sail
ing," with each sailor competing
as an individual against 17 others
to get through the course as
quickly as possible.
"The goal [of team racing] is
to work together to get in the
best combination to win, so to do
that we have a whole playbook.
Let's say I'm sailing and my
teammate is behind, I can trap
the competitor and let my team
mate pass to get ahead and get
into a better combination," said
senior Tally Buckstaff. "It really
involves working together and
talking and figuring out how to
get our team in the best situation
possible. So it's very dynamic
and you have to work well with
your teammates, so that's why
it's our favorite event."
Team racing involved three
Stanford boats, each with two
sailors, going up against a group
of three boats from its competi
tor. The goal is to get all three
boats into the best sequence so
that they all finish near the top.
It boils down to using the rules
and concepts of fleet racing in
combination with coordinating
and working with two other
boats to maximize their score at
the finish line.
"It's kind of like chess but with an
athletic component," said senior Kel
ly Ortel. "It's very tactical, but you're
also having to work hard and it can
be physically exhausting. There's a
lot of inter-boat communication and
making sure the boat handling is in
sync with everything else that is hap
pening. It can be stressful if you
don't trust your teammates but
we're at a good point where we are
on the same page and we can trust
each other to do our jobs."
This year Stanford has an expe
rienced roster with 11 seniors, six of
which make up the core group of
starters for team racing. At the
start of their collegiate careers,
Stanford was ranked just 16th in the
nation and was not considered to be
a viable team for nationals. Four
years later, the current senior class
has seen the program progress into
the powerhouse it is today. The sen
iors now have a month to prepare

for another shot at the national title,
which the team missed out on last
year.
The Card, however, are at a dis
advantage heading into nationals.
Since most other schools are fin
ished with the academic year, they
are able to dedicate all of their time
on campus to sailing and don't have
to contend with finals the week of
competition. In addition, the top
sailing schools in the nation are all
on the East Coast within driving
distance of one another, and so are
able to practice against the top com
petitors during the month-long
drought of formal competition.
Stanford, however, is isolated from
those top schools because of its West
Coast location.
"We've done really well in our
regular season and we've pretty
much won everything, but they are
going to get better so we need to get
better," Buckstaff said.
While West Coast schools have
historically not been as competitive
in sailing as East Coast schools,
Stanford's budget allows it to travel
to the East Coast regularly during
the season to race against the top
schools before nationals. This ad
vantage creates a disparity between
Stanford and other PCCSC schools
that do not have the caliber of Stan
ford sailing.
"We are lucky in the sense that
our second team is really, really
good so the team that we'll be prac
ticing against could go and win a na
tional championship in team racing
so we can go up against those guys
who are really good," Buckstaff
said.

History has also proven to the
Card that it is easy for the team to
peak at the conference champi
onships and then become compla
cent in the month preceding na
tionals. Thus, it will be imperative
for Stanford to keep up its compet
itive spirit and maintain its current
drive.
"The biggest challenge ahead of

Another disadvantage that Stan
ford faces in the next month is emu
lating race-day conditions. The West
Coast is typically much windier than
the nationals venue in Maryland, so
East Coast schools have the advan
tage of practicing under more race
like conditions.

team racing and fifth in women's
fleet, finished conference cham
pionships this past weekend with
a first place finish in the team
event, sweeping all nine races
and qualifying for nationals in
the team event in one month.
Stanford has finished first in
the PCCSC Championships for
all three sailing events, including
the co-ed and female fleet
events, in addition to team rac
ing.
Fleet racing is what most
would consider "traditional sail
ing," with each sailor competing
as an individual against 17 others
to get through the course as
quickly as possible.
"The goal [of team racing] is
to work together to get in the
best combination to win, so to do
that we have a whole playbook.
Let's say I'm sailing and my
teammate is behind, I can trap
the competitor and let my team
mate pass to get ahead and get
into a better combination," said
senior Tally Buckstaff. "It really
involves working together and
talking and figuring out how to
get our team in the best situation
possible. So it's very dynamic
and you have to work well with
your teammates, so that's why
it's our favorite event."
Team racing involved three
Stanford boats, each with two
sailors, going up against a group
of three boats from its competi
tor. The goal is to get all three
boats into the best sequence so
that they all finish near the top.
It boils down to using the rules
and concepts of fleet racing in
combination with coordinating
and working with two other
boats to maximize their score at
the finish line.
"It's kind of like chess but with an
athletic component," said senior Kel
ly Ortel. "It's very tactical, but you're
also having to work hard and it can
be physically exhausting. There's a
lot of inter-boat communication and
making sure the boat handling is in
sync with everything else that is hap
pening. It can be stressful if you
don't trust your teammates but
we're at a good point where we are
on the same page and we can trust
each other to do our jobs."
This year Stanford has an expe
rienced roster with 11 seniors, six of
which make up the core group of
starters for team racing. At the
start of their collegiate careers,
Stanford was ranked just 16th in the
nation and was not considered to be
a viable team for nationals. Four
years later, the current senior class
has seen the program progress into
the powerhouse it is today. The sen
iors now have a month to prepare

for another shot at the national title,
which the team missed out on last
year.
The Card, however, are at a dis
advantage heading into nationals.
Since most other schools are fin
ished with the academic year, they
are able to dedicate all of their time
on campus to sailing and don't have
to contend with finals the week of
competition. In addition, the top
sailing schools in the nation are all
on the East Coast within driving
distance of one another, and so are
able to practice against the top com
petitors during the month-long
drought of formal competition.
Stanford, however, is isolated from
those top schools because of its West
Coast location.
"We've done really well in our
regular season and we've pretty
much won everything, but they are
going to get better so we need to get
better," Buckstaff said.
While West Coast schools have
historically not been as competitive
in sailing as East Coast schools,
Stanford's budget allows it to travel
to the East Coast regularly during
the season to race against the top
schools before nationals. This ad
vantage creates a disparity between
Stanford and other PCCSC schools
that do not have the caliber of Stan
ford sailing.
"We are lucky in the sense that
our second team is really, really
good so the team that we'll be prac
ticing against could go and win a na
tional championship in team racing
so we can go up against those guys
who are really good," Buckstaff
said.

History has also proven to the
Card that it is easy for the team to
peak at the conference champi
onships and then become compla
cent in the month preceding na
tionals. Thus, it will be imperative
for Stanford to keep up its compet
itive spirit and maintain its current
drive.
"The biggest challenge ahead of

Another disadvantage that Stan
ford faces in the next month is emu

Coast is typically much windier than
the nationals venue in Maryland, so
East Coast schools have the advan
tage of practicing under more race
like conditions.
