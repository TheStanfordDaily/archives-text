## SUPER TUESDAY Color-blind politics? 
### Aimee Trujillo 
The Supreme Court has just
set a dangerous precedent by
upholding Michigan's ban on
affirmative action policies in public
universities. In the Schuette v.
Coalition to Defend Affirma
tive Action case, the Court voted
6-2 in favor of the ban.
The danger of the decision does
not involve any infringement of
state rights, real or perceived. The
danger is not in any judgment on
the constitutionality of race-con
scious admissions policies in higher
education or the possibility of a fed
eral ban thereof. The danger comes
from the fear of addressing race
head-on.
In reality, the Court did not
make any decision on affirmative
action; instead, it turned the deci
sion over to the hands of the Michi
gan voters. As Justice Kennedy
stated, "The courts may not disem
power the voters from choosing
which path to follow." Thus, now
each state may (or may not) vote on
a referendum to allow race as a con
sideration in college admissions.
However, what is the role of the
judicial branch if not to protect the
citizens of the country from dis
crimination or the outcomes of a
history of discrimination? The
Supreme Court has confronted
race directly in the past in cases
when minorities were left behind
such as Plessy v. Ferguson and
Brown v. Board of Education.
However, the recent decisions of
the Court have shown a move in the
opposite direction. "Our country has
changed," Chief Justice John G.
Roberts Jr. wrote in the majority
opinion in the decision to strike
down crucial parts of the Voting
Rights Act of 1965. But this is not a
good enough reason to take up a
faulty "color-blind" logic today in
admissions procedures or voting
rights.
As much as we would like to be
lieve it, the country has not
changed. While overt racism may
no longer be as socially acceptable
as it used to be in years past, there
are still striking racial wealth dis
parities in our country that are con
tinuing to widen. Minorities are dis
proportionately affected by unem
ployment. There are still wide
spread achievement gaps between
races across the country. And in
states where affirmative action has

been banned, public universities
have tended to enroll fewer black
and Hispanic freshmen. Enroll
ment of black students at UCLA
has dropped to three percent of the
student body, sparking large social
media action and the viral Black
Bruins spoken word project to initi
ate discussion on the matter.
These systemic problems will
not be fixed if we refuse to acknowl
edge their reality or the history of
discrimination in this country. As
Justice Sotomayor stated in her
dissent, "the way to stop discrimi
nation on the basis of race is to
speak openly and candidly on the
subject of race, and to apply the
Constitution with eyes open to the
unfortunate effects of centuries of
racial discrimination."
Here at Stanford, a private uni
versity where admissions proce
dures are not dictated by the state,
we are fortunate enough to achieve
much more racial diversity than
UCLA and other California public
schools. This is can only be attained
by taking race into account. Even in
come-based affirmative action would
fail to help close the achievement
gap between races because there are
six times as many low-SES white
students as black students to whom
income-based affirmative action
would also give preference.
The Supreme Court's decision
on the Michigan case now simply
perpetuates the lie that races are
"equal enough" in the country. It al
lows majority rule to overtake mi
nority rights something that the
republican process was never
meant to uphold. The Supreme
Court must exert its authority in
order to reduce the de facto dis
crimination that still pervades soci
ety today.
The U.S. is not color-blind, nor
does it need to be. What we need is
frank awareness of the true racial
disparities that still exist and action
to eliminate them.
