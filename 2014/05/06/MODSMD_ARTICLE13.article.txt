# SUPER TUESDAY
## Rights and responsibility 
### Anthony Ghosn 
Generally speaking, I am an
unrelenting opponent of gov
ernment intervention. Let
the free market decide the optimal
outcome; often times, it is the sys
tem most beneficial to society as a
whole. On the subject of affirmative
action, however, my opinions are
slightly different. I wholeheartedly
disagree with the Supreme Court's
recent decision to uphold a ban on
affirmative action.

The truth is that the challenges
facing minority communities today
are not born from free-market phe
nomena, but are rather shaped by
political, social and economic reali
ties. It is our government that, for
the first half of the last century, ex
plicitly and consistently pursued
policies that came at a great disad
vantage to people of color in this
country. Our government pursued
polices of oppression and division
such as segregating schools and ty
ing public school financing to prop

erty taxes. However, instead of at
tempting to elucidate all the ways
that citizens of color are disadvan
taged, I will attempt to address two
of the main objections to affirma
tive action.
The first and most frequent ob
jection is that affirmative action
causes a distortion in a meritocrat
ic system. While I value meritocra
cy as a metric upon which to judge
candidates, I do not feel that static
comparisons of curricular achieve
ments are appropriate metrics for
judging merit.
Consider the fact that the aver
age African American senior in
high school has roughly the same
reading level as a white eighth
grader in this country. Stereotype
threat can cause minority groups
with negative stereotypes to per
form worse on tests. If blacks' low
er test scores are taken into ac
count without considering contex
tual evidence, you are no longer

creating a fair atmosphere. The
playing field is not level.
More importantly, however,
there is psychological evidence
championed at this university by
Professor Carol Dweck —to sup
port the representation of intelli
gence as an entity that can grow, as
opposed to a fixed quantity. In oth
er words, intelligence is something
that is cultivated and as such
should be evaluated with reference
to the opportunities for growth
that were available, rather than
some kind of fixed character trait
that has an upper limit. In other
words, the academic, social and
economic environment of a student
matters. Students should be evalu
ated with reference to their origins
and environments for a system to
be truly meritocratic.

The second and frankly most
objectionable argument was put
forth by Justice Kennedy when he
wrote, "In a society in which those
[racial] lines are becoming more
blurred, the attempt to define race
based categories also raises serious
questions of its own." Could he be
referring to the mere 2.4 percent of
Americans who identify with two or
more races? Surely they could not
have "blurred" the fact that 97.6
percent of Americans are racially
homogenous.
Even when taking a clear dis
tinction between whites and non
whites, we see that non-whites have
a median income that is $18,300
lower than that of whites, or rough
ly 65 percent of the white median
income. This is especially relevant
because public school financing
tends to be tied to local taxes. A re
port coming out of the Center for
American Progress stated, "Chil
dren attending school in higher
poverty districts still have substan
tially less access to state and local
revenue than children attending
school in lower-poverty districts."
Take these two facts together and
you get a pretty damning picture of
racially delineated disadvantages
in this country.
Affirmative action is a crucial
step towards righting some of the
political wrongs that have been
committed by the United States. It
is a necessary correction to an un
fair system and it is a real tragedy
that the Supreme Court has ex
pressed dissent towards the
process.
