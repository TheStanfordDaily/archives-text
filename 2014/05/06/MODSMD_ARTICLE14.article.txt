# TRACK & FIELD
## RECORD-SHATTERING NIGHT 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
When the Payton Jordan Invitational comes
to the Farm each year, it's always a special occa
sion, as the race brings not only the best colle
giate runners in the nation but also professional
runners to Cobb Track at Angell Field in a com
petition that nearly always offers favorable con
ditions for middle and long-distance runners. It
was certainly an extra-special meet for Stanford
runners this year, with personal records being
set left and right and school and personal

records being shattered.
Leading the charge was junior Aisling Cuffe,
who continued to add to the growing list of acco
lades that she has posted this season with an as
tounding time of 15:11.13 in the 5,000 meters.
She finished sixth in the race amidst a group of
professionals and collegians alike.
"I was ready to race against a bunch of peo
ple with 'unattached' next to their names or
'Nike' next to their names and all these spon
sors and stuff," said Cuffe in a post-meet inter
view with Stanford Athletics. "It's about time
we got to mix it up with the big dogs, and it felt

really good."
Not only did her time shatter her previous
personal record of 15:53.95 set in this past in
door season but it also set a new Stanford
record and marked the third-fastest 5,000 time
in collegiate history. It was an improvement of
nearly 10 seconds over the previous Stanford
record of 15:20.44. For her efforts, Cuffe was
awarded the USTFCCCA National Women's
Track and Field Athlete of the Week award.
In addition, the 5,000 also proved very fruit-
ful for senior Jessica Tonn,
who also set a new personal
best of 15:32.26 to beat her
old mark by 22 seconds and
put her at No. 7 on the all
time Stanford 5,000 list.
Freshman Vanessa Eraser
ran in the third heat and also
set a personal best.
On the men's side, Stan
ford had a handful of individ
uals with phenomenal races
in the 5,000, with junior Joe
Rosa, senior Erik Olson and
freshman Sean McGorty all
claiming times in the all-time
Stanford top 10 with times of
13:33.56,13:36.91 and 13:37.64,

respectively. McGorty, who is
taking a redshirt season, was
competing unattached.
Freshman Jack Keelan and
sophomore Garrett Sweatt
also notched new personal
bests.
The Payton Jordan meet
also lived up to its billing as
one of the best events for
middle and long-distance
runners to have top-notch
meets, with the professionals
competing in the first heat of
the 5,000 claiming each of the
top eight times in the event
in the world this year.
In one of the Cardinal's
strongest events, the
women's 800, Stanford ath
letes again shined, with
sophomore Amy Weis
senbach posting a a02.60 to
continue to improve on her

already-phenomenal per
formances and sophomore
Claudia Saunders breaking
her personal record by mul
tiple seconds to run a
2:03.44, which put her at
third all-time on the Stan
ford 800 list. Justine Fedron
ic, who exhausted her out
door eligibility last season
and ran unattached, also
posted a fantastic 2:02.38.
With the Pac-12 Champi
onships rapidly approaching
from May 17-18, Payton
Jordan showed the team to
be in fantastic shape and
seemingly very well pre
pared to face off against the
other top collegiate athletes
in the country.
