## RECORD-SHATTERING NIGHT 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
When the Payton Jordan Invitational comes
to the Farm each year, it's always a special occa
sion, as the race brings not only the best colle
giate runners in the nation but also professional
runners to Cobb Track at Angell Field in a com

Leading the charge was junior Aisling Cuffe,
who continued to add to the growing list of acco

She finished sixth in the race amidst a group of

'Nike' next to their names and all these spon
sors and stuff," said Cuffe in a post-meet inter
view with Stanford Athletics. "It's about time
we got to mix it up with the big dogs, and it felt

really good."
Not only did her time shatter her previous
personal record of 15:53.95 set in this past in
door season but it also set a new Stanford
record and marked the third-fastest 5,000 time
in collegiate history. It was an improvement of
nearly 10 seconds over the previous Stanford
record of 15:20.44. For her efforts, Cuffe was
awarded the USTFCCCA National Women's
Track and Field Athlete of the Week award.
In addition, the 5,000 also proved very fruit-
