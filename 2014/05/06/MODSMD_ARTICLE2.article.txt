# Cinco de Mayo observances spur protest
## Students organize against cultural appropriation 
### ALEX ZIVKOVIC DESK EDITOR 
Students demonstrated near the Braun
Music Center on Monday in an effort to edu
cate the campus community about the history
of Cinco de Mayo and protest the alleged cul
tural appropriation of the day's Mexican her
itage.
"We were thinking we want to have a
demonstration given that today is Cinco de
Mayo to raise awareness about the issues of
cultural appropriation and why a lot of people
can be offended by things that go on on this
day," explained Brenda Munoz 'l4.
Cultural appropriation refers to actions
that trivialize aspects of a culture by not re
specting a custom's symbolic significance or
the history of a style of dress or other artifact.
On Cinco de Mayo, protestors noted, many
students wear serapes, sombreros and fake
mustaches in an effort to dress "Mexican."
In addition to the offensive costumes, stu
dents also expressed concern that the mean
ing of the Cinco de Mayo holiday has become
lost for most Americans. The holiday is cele
brated more often in the United States than
in Mexico because it marks a specific, region
ally celebrated battle between Mexico and
France, rather than Mexican independence
generally.
"I just feel like Cinco de Mayo and St.
Patrick's Day have just become holidays that
have just become the norm now to just drink
and people have just accepted and haven't re
ally stopped to think about that it's really of
fensive," said Karen Oropeza 'l7 about the hol
iday's misrepresentation.
From demonstration to protest
Around the start of the demonstrations,
several allegedly intoxicated students stole
and later destroyed two of the demonstrators'
posters.
"I was in my room with my roommate, and
we heard people making a ruckus outside,"
said Ki'ista Fryauff 'l5. "One had a Mexican
flag draped around their neck, holding han
dles of alcohol."
According to Fryauff, the intoxicated stu
dents in question were screaming and disturb
ing the area, including partying in the fountain
in White Plaza after they ripped the posters.
Demonstrators described their actions to
wards the demonstration as threatening to
ward the Latino community.
"It was very jarring to see that, especially
on this campus which in my experience has
been a very open and respectful place," said

Maria Acosta 'l4.
Following that disruption, demonstrators
sent emails to various email lists expressing
their outrage and asking for more support at
the demonstrations.
"Today was supposed to be more about
awareness," Munoz said. "I think the last
three hours the purpose has kind of changed
into a protest in away to assert our presence."

Before the protests
The Cinco de Mayo demonstrations fol
lowed the events of this past week, which saw
several controversies over the ways the Uni
versity community recognized the holiday.

On Monday afternoon, students from various groups met near the Braun Music Center to
protest cultural appropriation and representation of Mexican heritage on Cinco de Mayo.
prompted members of the
Latino community to call a
meeting with the sorority to
explain their objections to
the theme of the event.
"I attended the meeting
where we discussed [the
event] with the Pi Phi presi
dent as well as other mem
bers of Comunidad and
Greek life administrators,"
Oropeza said. "I would like to
think that their intentions
weren't to offend people but

yet I am very surprised that
[the] administration had not
realized that this event has
been happening for such a
long time."
Though the event had re
tained the same theme for
several years previously, the
organizers changed this
year's programming to fea
ture a summer theme instead.
"By the time we had
talked to them for the meet
ing that we had on Friday
they had already decided
they were going to change
the theme so it ended up be
ing Pi Phi Paradise, I think,
and it was just ocean, beach
y, summer," said Annie Phan

'l6, an ethnic theme associ
ate at Casa Zapata.
Last Thursday, Stern
Dining hosted a Mexican
themed dinner on May 1,
with traditional Mexican
food in celebration of the up
coming holiday. Some mem
bers of the community ex
pressed concern over the
sombreros worn by many of
the Dining Ambassadors, the
dining staff and various stu
dent attendees.
