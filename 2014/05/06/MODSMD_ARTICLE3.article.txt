## Help Center opens new location University expands services for faculty, staff and family 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
The Faculty Staff Help Center,
which offers faculty, staff and their
families professional and confiden
tial counseling and consultation, re
cently opened a new satellite clinic
off Porter Drive in an effort to bet
ter serve the growing Stanford com
munity in that area.
"We're trying to make it easier
for people to come see us," ex
plained Rosan Gomperts, director of
the Help Center. "People could use
the service there since it's hard to
get to campus."
According to Gomperts, the
satellite office will offer the same cli
nicians and services as the other two
Faculty Staff Help Center satellite
offices, which are located at the
SLAC National Accelerator Labo
ratory and in San Jose. Those serv
ices including counseling services
and departmental consultation and
training are free of
charge to Stanford staff and
faculty for up to 10 counsel
ing sessions per situation for
each employee and eligible
dependent.
The Porter Drive office
currently opens for two
hours on Thursday mornings
and is staffed by one profes
sional staffer. Counselor Vin
utha Mohan described the
clinic as busy and well-uti
lized.

"We are very full," Mohan
said. "If I'm there for the en
tire two hours, I'd see about
six clients."
Mohan stated that the
most common reason for
client visits is the loss of a re
lationship or work-related is
sues.
"People come for individ
ual relationships and couple
counseling across all ages,"
Mohan said. "We also have
work-related problems, for
example if a co-worker can't
get along with others. We al
so have people that come for
parenting issues, dealing
with children of any age, es
pecially teenagers. Some

times we have more difficult
cases, depression or anxiety."
Gomperts said that the
Porter Drive satellite of
fice's hours and staffing
might increase in the future
should additional demand
materialize.
"The new office has limit
ed office time, just Thursday
mornings, so if we run up
against more people wanting
to book times there, we'd
have to look into expanding
the hours," Gomperts said.
"But we haven't run across
that [problem] yet."
