## Professors seek to define well-lived life Atheist, theologian explore their differing religions worldviews 
### MADELEINE HAN DESK EDITOR 
An atheist philosopher, a Christian the
ologian and a roomful of Stanford students
converged at the Stanford Faculty Club
yesterday evening for a discussion about
the meaning of a well-lived life.
The event featured Professor of Philos
ophy Kenneth Taylor, who co-hosts the ra
dio show Philosophy Talk, and N.T. Wright,
a leading New Testament scholar who
teaches at the University of St. Andrew's in
Scotland, in an examination of the assump
tions underlying atheistic and Christian
worldviews. Dean of Religious Life Scotty
McLennan moderated the discussion.
The event opened with Taylor's and
Wright's views of the importance of human
identity. The discussion quickly progressed
onto differences between the speakers'
views on the capacity of science, the nature
of history and the role stories play on soci
etal and individual levels.
Amanda Reeves 'l7, a member of Chris
tian fellowship group Inter Varsity, spoke to
the importance of the discussion.
"I think it's really important we're hav
ing this event so we can ask these funda
mental questions about who we are, why
we're here, what it means that we're here...
in an environment where we can see multi
ple viewpoints and be able to make in
formed decisions about what we believe,"
Reeves said.
"It's not very obvious, but if you look in
the dorms or between friends these conver
sations happen," said Rachel Lim 'l7, an
other Inter Varsity member.
Taylor and Wright went on to cover im
mediate elements of the atheist and Chris
tian worldview, including morality, faith and
the role reason plays in the "good life."
Taylor said that he has never experi
enced revelation despite growing up in a re
ligious environment, emphasizing the cen
trality of reason in his approach of the
world.
Though Wright also spoke to the capac
ities of reason, he added that God has
played a different role in his life.
"For me, God has never been an ex
planatory system. It's almost been the oth
er way around," Wright said, citing Jesus
as the human manifestation of Christian
love.
