## Harden-Thunder breakup hurting both parties 
### Vignesh Venkataraman 
Roughly two editions of
the NBA Playoffs ago,
James Harden was the
greatest combination of
man and beard alive. I
offer my insincere apologies to Brian
Wilson who unfortunately now
plays for the wrong team to garner
any affection from me and further
more only directly influences the out
come of one-ninth of a baseball game.
In a vital playoff series against the
San Antonio Spurs, the NBA West
ern Conference juggernauts of the
last decade, Harden (then a member
of the Oklahoma City Thunder) daz
zled; hitting clutch threes and driving
into the teeth of the vaunted Spurs
defense seemingly at will; coming off
screens and nailing jumpers; staunch
ing the bleeding whenever the Thun
der bench seemed mired in a shooting
slump; and even playing a semblance
of defense, coming up with steals and
flopping around effectively to draw
offensive fouls.
When the Thunder were finally
halted by the Miami Heat in the fi
nals, losing a hard-fought playoff se
ries to Le√üron James, Dwyane Wade,
Chris Bosh and friends, it seemed
that with a core quartet of Kevin Du
rant, Russell Westbrook, James
Harden and Serge Ibaka, the future
for the Thunder was bright. After all,
Durant was (and is) one of the great
est scorers in NBA history. West
brook's manic energy, relentless play,
and slight insanity seemed like good
complements to Durant's smooth
game. Harden was the bearded
bench all by himself. Finally, Ibaka
was blossoming into one of the best
low-post defenders and rebounders in
the league, all while trying to develop
a jump shot on the fly.
Fast-forward two years, and that
quartet has been irrevocably split two
ways. Harden now plies his craft for
the Houston Rockets as the "first su
perstar" recruited by evil-genius
cum-sabermetrician-cum-GM Daryl
Morey, in his quest to boil the NBA
down to a series of numbers that can
be gamed for instant victory. His
trade to the Rockets fundamentally
altered the NBA landscape as we
know it, prompting other players like
Dwight Howard, Jeremy Lin and
Omer Asik to sign with the newly for
tified Houston squad.
Meanwhile, the Thunder tried to
replace Harden's scoring output with
Kevin Martin (no longer with the
team) and a bunch of NBA D-League
castoffs. To both sides, the outcome
can only be described as mixed. And
that might be too kind a judgment.
It is easiest to look at Harden as a
single entity on the Rockets. Al
though his per-game numbers have
all increased (this season he aver
aged, per game, 25.4 points, 4.7 re
bounds and 6.1 assists, to go along
with 1.6 steals and 3.6 turnovers),
they have come as a result of his in
creased usage rates and at the cost of
his efficiency; his field goal percent
age, which peaked when he was a su
per sub for the Thunder, has declined
from 49.1 percent in his last season
with the Thunder to 43.8 percent and
45.6 percent in his first two seasons
with the Rockets. His 3-point per
centages have dropped from 39 per
cent down to 36 percent, while he
hoists them at nearly double the rate
he did before the trade.
Harden's decline has been even
more obvious when you watch him
play; the crisp ball movement, the
daring forays to the rim, the decisive
ness that so characterized his time
with the Thunder have all been re
placed by lots of standing around, a
ton of tough threes and fadeaway
jumpers, and a penchant for "ball
stopping" (once a teammate passes to
him, he ain't passing it back).
His defense is even worse: to call it
lazy would be an affront to lazy folks
worldwide. All you need to know
about James Harden's defense is that
there is an 11-minute-long video on
You Tube entitled "James Harden,
Defensive Juggernaut (2013-2014)."
Note to readers: the title is about as
facetious and snarky as a title could
be. In short, moving Harden from the
Thunder bench to the center of the
Rockets' starting lineup has revealed
significant holes in his game holes
that were well hidden by his limited
and specific roles when he came off
the bench for Oklahoma City.
The Thunder, too, have suffered
from the trade. Their bench lacks any
scoring threats, and they've been
forced (due to their reluctance to
climb over the luxury tax) to employ
Derek Fisher's services as a key
bench player. Over the last two years,
