## Harden-Thunder breakup hurting both parties 
### Vignesh Venkataraman 
Roughly two editions of
the NBA Playoffs ago,
James Harden was the
greatest combination of
man and beard alive. I
offer my insincere apologies to Brian
Wilson who unfortunately now
plays for the wrong team to garner
any affection from me and further
more only directly influences the out
come of one-ninth of a baseball game.
In a vital playoff series against the
San Antonio Spurs, the NBA West
ern Conference juggernauts of the
last decade, Harden (then a member
of the Oklahoma City Thunder) daz
zled; hitting clutch threes and driving
into the teeth of the vaunted Spurs
defense seemingly at will; coming off
screens and nailing jumpers; staunch
ing the bleeding whenever the Thun
der bench seemed mired in a shooting
slump; and even playing a semblance
of defense, coming up with steals and
flopping around effectively to draw
offensive fouls.
When the Thunder were finally
halted by the Miami Heat in the fi
nals, losing a hard-fought playoff se
ries to Le√üron James, Dwyane Wade,
Chris Bosh and friends, it seemed
that with a core quartet of Kevin Du
rant, Russell Westbrook, James
Harden and Serge Ibaka, the future
for the Thunder was bright. After all,
Durant was (and is) one of the great
est scorers in NBA history. West
brook's manic energy, relentless play,
and slight insanity seemed like good
complements to Durant's smooth
game. Harden was the bearded
bench all by himself. Finally, Ibaka
was blossoming into one of the best
low-post defenders and rebounders in
the league, all while trying to develop
a jump shot on the fly.
Fast-forward two years, and that
quartet has been irrevocably split two
ways. Harden now plies his craft for
the Houston Rockets as the "first su
perstar" recruited by evil-genius
cum-sabermetrician-cum-GM Daryl
Morey, in his quest to boil the NBA
down to a series of numbers that can
be gamed for instant victory. His
trade to the Rockets fundamentally
altered the NBA landscape as we
know it, prompting other players like
Dwight Howard, Jeremy Lin and
Omer Asik to sign with the newly for
tified Houston squad.
Meanwhile, the Thunder tried to
replace Harden's scoring output with
Kevin Martin (no longer with the
team) and a bunch of NBA D-League
castoffs. To both sides, the outcome
can only be described as mixed. And
that might be too kind a judgment.
It is easiest to look at Harden as a
single entity on the Rockets. Al
though his per-game numbers have
all increased (this season he aver
aged, per game, 25.4 points, 4.7 re
bounds and 6.1 assists, to go along
with 1.6 steals and 3.6 turnovers),
they have come as a result of his in
creased usage rates and at the cost of
his efficiency; his field goal percent
age, which peaked when he was a su
per sub for the Thunder, has declined
from 49.1 percent in his last season
with the Thunder to 43.8 percent and
45.6 percent in his first two seasons
with the Rockets. His 3-point per
centages have dropped from 39 per
cent down to 36 percent, while he
hoists them at nearly double the rate
he did before the trade.
Harden's decline has been even
more obvious when you watch him
play; the crisp ball movement, the
daring forays to the rim, the decisive
ness that so characterized his time
with the Thunder have all been re
placed by lots of standing around, a
ton of tough threes and fadeaway
jumpers, and a penchant for "ball
stopping" (once a teammate passes to
him, he ain't passing it back).
His defense is even worse: to call it
lazy would be an affront to lazy folks
worldwide. All you need to know
about James Harden's defense is that
there is an 11-minute-long video on
You Tube entitled "James Harden,
Defensive Juggernaut (2013-2014)."
Note to readers: the title is about as
facetious and snarky as a title could
be. In short, moving Harden from the
Thunder bench to the center of the
Rockets' starting lineup has revealed
significant holes in his game holes
that were well hidden by his limited
and specific roles when he came off
the bench for Oklahoma City.
The Thunder, too, have suffered
from the trade. Their bench lacks any
scoring threats, and they've been
forced (due to their reluctance to
climb over the luxury tax) to employ
Derek Fisher's services as a key
bench player. Over the last two years,

the questions about the ability of
Durant and Westbrook to coexist
have not faded away; in fact, they
have gotten more and more intense
as the postseason losses mount for
the team.
Under coach Scott Brooks, the
Thunder have perfected the vaunted
Clogged Toilet offense (a term bor
rowed from Bill Simmons), which has
two valiants: let Westbrook go isola
tion or let Durant go isolation. For ob
vious reasons, this offense struggles
to score points and makes basketball
purists worldwide shudder with its
distinct lack of aesthetic beauty.
Although Ibaka has developed in
to an excellent supporting player, he
is not a ball handler who can manu
facture offense, and that is really
where Harden is missed the most.
His ability to play multiple positions
and produce instant points is the
perfect tonic for this Thunder team's
propensity to fall into extended scor
ing slumps from both Durant and
Westbrook. Sadly, it is a tonic that
the Thunder deemed unaffordable
when they traded him away for es
sentially nothing.
The moral of this story? This is
where things get murky, because both
teams and both sets of players are still
achieving great success. The Rockets

were a few small breaks away from
defeating the Portland Trail Blazers in
the first round, and the Thunder, de
spite a game 1 shellacking at the
hands of the Los Angeles Clippers,
could still find their way into the West
ern Conference finals. However, the
basketball fan in me weeps for what
could have been; in my humble opin
ion, Harden is not yet the superstar
that his team and his contract say he
is, while the Thunder are not built to
be able to compete in this loaded
Western Conference environment
without finding a true replacement for
Harden's unique skillset.
The regress of both parties in
volved in that fateful trade is yet an
other "what if?" moment in a league
that manufactures them with regu
larity. We like to talk about winners
and losers as soon as trades are com
pleted, or at least after both sides
have been given enough time to see
returns on their investments. In this
case, could it be possible that both
sides are suffering from buyer's re
morse? And if they had a chance to
do it all over again, would they make
the same moves as they did two sea
sons ago?

Vignesh Venkataraman hopes that
the Thunder will continue to col
lapse so that he can apply for the
soon-to-be coaching vacancy in
Oklahoma City. To give Vignesh
