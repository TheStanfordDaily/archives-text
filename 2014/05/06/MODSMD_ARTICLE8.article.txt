# LAMBERT CUP RECLAIMED
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
In the 81st annual Big Row
against No. 2 California at Red
wood Shores, three of No. 4 Stan
ford's four women's rowing boats
toppled the higher ranked Bears to
take home the Lambert Cup for the
first time since 2009. The women's
lightweight team swept Cal's 3VB
and 4VB boats, while the Stanford
men's team was swept in all three
events.

The last time that the women's
varsity boats swept Cal was at the
2009 Big Row the same year that
the Card went on to win its first and
only NCAA Team Championship.
"I'm so proud of the depth of
this team this year," said senior
Kristy Wentzel of the women's

openweights. "This year across the
board, there is so much strong com
petition between the boats and
everybody is in it."
The 2VB boat was the last Stan
ford boat to beat Cal, in 2011. This
year, it captured its sixth win of the
season, beating Cal by a narrow
margin of 2.7 seconds. The varsity
four boat started the three-boat win
streak for the women after the 2V4
dropped the first race for the open
weight women. Following the IV4,
the 2VB took the race from No. 2
Cal.
The final race for the women
was the IVB, which was coming off
of a narrow loss to USC over the
previous weekend. Despite Cal hav
ing a much stronger base rate than
the Card, Stanford was able to push
ahead from the start and take the

lead early on, ultimately winning
the race by three seconds.
"I didn't allow myself to think
that we [the IVB] were going to win
the race until about the last 200 me
ters and it was just this surreal mo
ment of winning and it was just
awesome to pass that finish line to
gether," Wentzel said.
The women's lightweight teams
started off on the right stroke as the
No. 2 Cardinal swept both the
Bears' 4VB and 3VB boats. The two
teams last met for the Card's first
regatta of the season at the Pac-12
Challenge. In that race, the 2VB fell
to Cal's 4VB by 12 seconds with the
IVB losing to Cal's 3YB by just over
four seconds.

"One of our goals today was to
make this race something that we
could be excited to take to our na

tionals," said junior IVB coxswain
Jordan Duval-Smith. "We wanted
this race to be something we felt
comfortable with and confident in
and I think we did that."
This time around, the Cardinal
were much better prepared after
almost a full season of competition
under their belt. Despite an early
headwind, the 2VB and IVB cruised
to victory, winning by 16.1 and 16.8
seconds, respectively. It was the
first victory for the 2VB since the
San Diego Classic in early April.
"We [the 2VB] took the lead
right from the start," said senior
Molly Hayes. "We had 15 high
strokes [opening sprint] after our
first five strokes and... we decided
to keep inside our boat and not look

No. 4 Stanford women's rowing upset the higher-ranked Cal Bears by winning three of the four races, bringing the Lambert Cup back to Stan
ford for the first time since 2009. The women's lightweight rowing team also defeated Cal while the men's rowing team was swept by the Bears.
