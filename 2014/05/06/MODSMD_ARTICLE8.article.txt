# LAMBERT CUP RECLAIMED
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
In the 81st annual Big Row
against No. 2 California at Red
wood Shores, three of No. 4 Stan
ford's four women's rowing boats
toppled the higher ranked Bears to
take home the Lambert Cup for the
first time since 2009. The women's
lightweight team swept Cal's 3VB
and 4VB boats, while the Stanford
men's team was swept in all three
events.

The last time that the women's
varsity boats swept Cal was at the
2009 Big Row the same year that
the Card went on to win its first and
only NCAA Team Championship.
"I'm so proud of the depth of
this team this year," said senior
Kristy Wentzel of the women's

openweights. "This year across the
board, there is so much strong com
petition between the boats and
everybody is in it."
The 2VB boat was the last Stan
ford boat to beat Cal, in 2011. This
year, it captured its sixth win of the
season, beating Cal by a narrow
margin of 2.7 seconds. The varsity
four boat started the three-boat win
streak for the women after the 2V4
dropped the first race for the open
weight women. Following the IV4,
the 2VB took the race from No. 2
Cal.
The final race for the women
was the IVB, which was coming off
of a narrow loss to USC over the
previous weekend. Despite Cal hav
ing a much stronger base rate than
the Card, Stanford was able to push
ahead from the start and take the

lead early on, ultimately winning
the race by three seconds.
"I didn't allow myself to think
that we [the IVB] were going to win
the race until about the last 200 me
ters and it was just this surreal mo
ment of winning and it was just
awesome to pass that finish line to
gether," Wentzel said.
The women's lightweight teams
started off on the right stroke as the
No. 2 Cardinal swept both the
Bears' 4VB and 3VB boats. The two
teams last met for the Card's first
regatta of the season at the Pac-12
Challenge. In that race, the 2VB fell
to Cal's 4VB by 12 seconds with the
IVB losing to Cal's 3YB by just over
four seconds.

"One of our goals today was to
make this race something that we
could be excited to take to our na

tionals," said junior IVB coxswain
Jordan Duval-Smith. "We wanted
this race to be something we felt
comfortable with and confident in
and I think we did that."
This time around, the Cardinal
were much better prepared after
almost a full season of competition
under their belt. Despite an early
headwind, the 2VB and IVB cruised
to victory, winning by 16.1 and 16.8
seconds, respectively. It was the
first victory for the 2VB since the
San Diego Classic in early April.
"We [the 2VB] took the lead
right from the start," said senior
Molly Hayes. "We had 15 high
strokes [opening sprint] after our
first five strokes and... we decided
to keep inside our boat and not look

No. 4 Stanford women's rowing upset the higher-ranked Cal Bears by winning three of the four races, bringing the Lambert Cup back to Stan
ford for the first time since 2009. The women's lightweight rowing team also defeated Cal while the men's rowing team was swept by the Bears.
out of our boat until about 500 me
ters and saw that we were ahead."
Unfortunately, after holding on
to the Schwabacher Cup for the
past year, the No. 11 Stanford men's
team was unable to put together a
second consecutive underdog win
over the Bears and was swept in the
frosh eight, 2VB and IVB races by
No. 2 Cal.
The Cardinal have been strug
gling all season to find their fastest
lineup. The lineup for Big Row was
set at practice the night before rac
ing, so the eight men didn't quite
have enough time to gel as a group.
"These were the top eight guys
for our team," said sophomore IVB
coxswain Nathalie Weiss. "And we
felt really good going into this race;
it's definitely the strongest lineup
that we have on our team. We were
definitely the underdogs going in but
we definitely got some confidence in
this lineup even though it was just

pulled together yesterday."
The four freshmen that had been
in contention for the IVB lineup were
moved to the frosh boat and the up
perclassmen who were "up in the
air," as assistant coach Jake Cor
nelius put it, were given a chance to
move up from the 2VB.
"We've been trying to make the
varsity boat faster and simultane
ously have the frosh coalesce as a
group so this was actually the first
race that all the [top] frosh have
been in the same boat," Cornelius
said.
Because of this lineup change, the
frosh eight had a much more com
petitive race than it had all season
long, falling to Cal by nine seconds.
The 2VB race was not nearly as close,
however; the Bears left the Card in
their wake by nearly 31 seconds.
Although the IVB lost by 10 sec
onds, the Cardinal used the race as
an opportunity to test out a faster
lineup and prepare for Pac-12s and
the Intercollegiate Rowing Associa
tion Championships. The team as a
whole, however, felt good about the
finish and will continue to make line
up and seat switches through the

end of the season. The race marked
the last time that three seniors
would race at Redwood Shores, in
cluding Austin Hack, a member of
the U.S. National Rowing team.
"We know [Cal is] a really fast
crew this year, really strong, so we
had a good race for our boat and in
the end that's what you've got to
walk away with: just being proud in
what you've accomplished," Weiss
said.
"We are closer [to where the
teams want to be] than we were in
San Diego so that's good," Cor
nelius said. "We just keep pushing
and we'll continue to make switches
and try to make the fastest boat and
see who rows particularly well to
gether, what guys fit in what seat
best and just take it from there. It's
a work in progress."
The men's and women's teams
have two weeks off from competi
tion before Pac-12s, followed by
IRAs and NCAAs, while the light
weights will have PCRC Champi
onships followed by their own IRAs.
