# POSTSEASON IN SIGHT
## 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
For the first time this season,
the Stanford baseball team (21-20,
9-12 Pac-12) stands with a record
above .500. After taking the final
two games of the series against
UCLA, the Cardinal hope to fur
ther improve their record as they
prepare to face Santa Clara (22-25,
12-9 WCC) at Sunken Diamond on
Tuesday evening.
The Cardinal had been no
stranger to the .500 benchmark this
season, having previously held
records of 2-2, 4-4,10-10,17-17,18-
18, 19-19 and 20-20 before finally
breaking through with a win to give
themselves more wins than losses.
While the decisive victory over
UCLA that pushed them over the
mark may just be another win, it
represents much more to a team
that has been battling to insert it

self back into the postseason con
versation all season long.
After the weekend series win
against UCLA, Stanford holds an
RPI of 31 according to Warren-
Nolan.com, which provides an up
dated estimate of where teams
stand before the official NCAA RPI
rankings come out later this week.
Before the UCLA series, the offi
cial RPI rankings placed Stanford
at No. 34.
Stanford must continue to im
prove its record if it hopes to move
from the postseason bubble into a
more certain position. With series
left against Arizona, Washington
State and Utah, three of the bottom
five teams in the Pac-12, the Card
will have a chance to finish out the
season on a high note. The Cardinal
will continue that bid Tuesday
against Santa Clara.
The Broncos and the Cardinal
squared off only two weeks ago in a

game that quickly turned into a
slugfest, with Stanford narrowly
eking out a 10-9 victory. Stanford
rallied from a 7-6 deficit and with
stood a late siege to secure victory
and move to 16-17 overall in the
first of back-to-back midweek con
tests.
Since then, Santa Clara has
notched a 5-2 record, winning both
of its weekend series against Loy
ola Marymount and the University
of San Francisco. In those seven
games, the Broncos have scored a
total of 49 runs to compensate for
their weak pitching staff. The
team's 4.29 ERA and .281 batting
average against indicate their
struggles to contain opponents
from the mound. They have allowed
eight runs or more in 12 games so
far this season.

season, leading the team with a
.438 on-base percentage and four
home runs to go along with a .312
batting average and 19 RBIs.
Berman had a five-game hitting
streak snapped on Sunday against
USF after hitting 9-for-19 (.474) in
that stretch.
The Cardinal finally saw the of
fensive production they had been
lacking for most of the season in
the series against UCLA. Although
the team only scored two runs on
Friday, they pushed 10 total runs
across the plate in their final two
games, the highest total in the final
two games of a weekend series for
Stanford since Feb. 22-23 against
Texas. Junior Austin Slater's seven
hits over the weekend led the team
and increased his team-leading
batting average to .331.
After mixing up the weekend
rotation over the past few weeks
with junior John Hochstatter and
sophomore Logan James earning
weekend starts, several pitchers
remain in the mix to start Tues
day's game. Freshmen Brett
Hanewich and Chris Viall, who
have each started at least seven
games and did not throw over the
weekend, will likely see action at
some point as head coach Mark
Marquess may choose to split the
starter's innings between several
pitchers as he has done in recent
midweek contests.
First pitch between Stanford
and Santa Clara is scheduled for
5:30 p.m. on Tuesday evening at
Sunken Diamond.

stranger to the .500 benchmark this
season, having previously held
records of 2-2, 4-4,10-10,17-17,18-
18, 19-19 and 20-20 before finally
breaking through with a win to give
themselves more wins than losses.
While the decisive victory over
UCLA that pushed them over the
mark may just be another win, it
represents much more to a team
that has been battling to insert it

self back into the postseason con
versation all season long.
After the weekend series win
against UCLA, Stanford holds an
RPI of 31 according to Warren-
Nolan.com, which provides an up
dated estimate of where teams
stand before the official NCAA RPI
rankings come out later this week.
Before the UCLA series, the offi
cial RPI rankings placed Stanford
at No. 34.
Stanford must continue to im
prove its record if it hopes to move
from the postseason bubble into a
more certain position. With series
left against Arizona, Washington
State and Utah, three of the bottom
five teams in the Pac-12, the Card
will have a chance to finish out the
season on a high note. The Cardinal
will continue that bid Tuesday
against Santa Clara.
The Broncos and the Cardinal
squared off only two weeks ago in a

game that quickly turned into a
slugfest, with Stanford narrowly
eking out a 10-9 victory. Stanford
rallied from a 7-6 deficit and with
stood a late siege to secure victory
and move to 16-17 overall in the
first of back-to-back midweek con
tests.
Since then, Santa Clara has
notched a 5-2 record, winning both
of its weekend series against Loy
ola Marymount and the University
of San Francisco. In those seven
games, the Broncos have scored a
total of 49 runs to compensate for
their weak pitching staff. The
team's 4.29 ERA and .281 batting
average against indicate their
struggles to contain opponents
from the mound. They have allowed
eight runs or more in 12 games so
far this season.

pelled the Broncos' offense this
season, leading the team with a
.438 on-base percentage and four
home runs to go along with a .312
batting average and 19 RBIs.
Berman had a five-game hitting
streak snapped on Sunday against
USF after hitting 9-for-19 (.474) in
that stretch.
The Cardinal finally saw the of
fensive production they had been
lacking for most of the season in
the series against UCLA. Although
the team only scored two runs on
Friday, they pushed 10 total runs
across the plate in their final two
games, the highest total in the final
two games of a weekend series for
Stanford since Feb. 22-23 against
Texas. Junior Austin Slater's seven
hits over the weekend led the team
and increased his team-leading
batting average to .331.
After mixing up the weekend
rotation over the past few weeks
with junior John Hochstatter and
sophomore Logan James earning
weekend starts, several pitchers
remain in the mix to start Tues
day's game. Freshmen Brett
Hanewich and Chris Viall, who
have each started at least seven
games and did not throw over the
weekend, will likely see action at
some point as head coach Mark
Marquess may choose to split the
starter's innings between several
pitchers as he has done in recent
midweek contests.
First pitch between Stanford
and Santa Clara is scheduled for
5:30 p.m. on Tuesday evening at
Sunken Diamond.
