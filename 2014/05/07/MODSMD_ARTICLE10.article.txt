## Men seek to take it slow through tourney 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
"Survive and advance."
That motto, coined by former North
Carolina State basketball coach Jim Val
vano during the Wolfpack's miraculous
championship run in 1983, is what Stanford
men's tennis head coach John Whitlinger is
focusing on as the Cardinal prepare to em
bark on their NCAA Championship journey
this weekend.
That's because the No. 27 Cardinal (14-
5,5-2 Pac-12) know that they are capable of
not only hanging around, but also going
swing-for-swing with some of the tennis
heavyweights in the country. When they see
some of those teams in the upcoming tour
nament, it will be all about taking it one
match at a time.

"[Our key is to] just compete hard,"
Whitlinger said. "We've played the best

teams in the country. We've played UCLA
at our place and when that got rained out, it
was going to be really tight, one way or an
other. When we went down there, we got
beat up a little bit but we've played the best
teams in the country and the guys know
what to expect."
Although it defeated some of the better
teams nationally in its strong run at the end
of the regular season but lost to Oregon in
the first round of the Pac-12 Tournament,
all of those matches are now behind the
Stanford team and its focus is just on the
road ahead, starting with Conference USA
champion No. 42 Tulsa (15-12) on Saturday
in its first-round matchup.
"[Ttilsa is] a very talented team too that
we can't overlook," Whitlinger said. "We've
got to be ready to play Saturday morning
and that's the biggest thing to worry

The availability of Maciek Romanowicz (above), who played No.2 singles and No.
1 doubles before going down with an injury, is a game-time decision on Saturday.
about."
How the Cardinal will fare in the
match against Tulsa and beyond,
if they advance through the rest of
the tournament rests partially on
the health of sophomore Maciek Ro
manowicz, who played No. 2 singles
and No. 1 doubles for the Cardinal
at the start of the season before suf
fering an injury that has kept him
out of the lineup since the April 4
loss at USC.
Despite not having played in
over a month, the return of the tal
ented Romanowicz to the lineup
would provide an immediate spark
although it would also throw a
wrench into the doubles pairings
that have been established since his
injury. When Romanowicz was in
the lineup, he was paired with junior
John Morrissey at the No. 1 doubles
slot. Since then, Morrissey has been
paired with senior Jamin Ball at the
No. 2 position.
Although there is no set
timetable on Romanowicz's return,
Whitlinger says that it will be a
"game-time decision" on Saturday
morning when the sophomore trav
els to Waco, Texas, with the team for
the first round of NCAAs.
"He's done a lot of good things
today in practice, things he hasn't
done in a while, and we've just got to
see how he responds over the next
few days once we get to Texas,"
Whitlinger said. "He's really eager
to play and the nice thing about it is

we've had success with him in the
lineup and without him in the lineup
... I've got a lot of guys ready to step
in and play well if Maciek can't go."
And indeed, a deep Stanford ros
ter that achieved success at the end
of the season without the contribu
tions of Romanowicz should be
ready to be quite competitive, with
or without him.
Morrissey has been a stalwart at
the No. 1 singles position, owning an
11-7 record at the top of Stanford's
lineup. Sophomore Anthony
Tsodikov has also been very strong
at No. 5 singles, with a 10-3 record
to his name in that slot. Finally, jun
ior Robert Stineman who slid in
to the No. 1 doubles slot with senior
Daniel Ho in Romanowicz's absence
has been a force from the No. 6
singles slot with an 8-3 record in
that position.
After a tough stretch in the mid
dle of the season, Ho rebounded
nicely in his No. 2 singles role, while
sophomores Trey Strobel and Nolan
Paige have been effective in their
mid-lineup roles as well.
That is encouraging for Stanford
because singles is where it has
shined throughout the season and
will again be the deciding factor in
whether it can make a deep tourna
ment run or not. Because the team's
ability to start off each of its match
es by securing the doubles point has
been shaky all season, it has often
had to rely on its singles performers
to come from behind and claim the
victory, and this paradigm has given
the players experience playing from
behind to secure the team win.
"There's no question that get
ting that early point is really impor

tant in NCAA competition because
it can be really problematic trying
to win four singles points,"
Whitlinger said. "But then again,
my guys have been doing it all year
long we've lost 10 doubles points
but only five matches. The nice part
about it is that we know what it feels
like to win the doubles point and
lose and we know what it feels like
to lose the doubles point and win."
Although Tulsa doesn't have as
deep of a roster as the Cardinal, it
offers stiff competition atop its line
up, with nationally ranked singles
performers in No. 81 Japie De
Klerk at the top post and No. 85
Clifford Marsland alongside him to
pace its singles performance. Mean
while, the Golden Hurricane's top
doubles pairing of Marsland and
Dylan McCloskey is ranked No. 27
nationally, while the Cardinal do not
have a ranked doubles team.

In order to advance past the first
round and set up what will likely be
a date with ninth-seeded Baylor, the
host of the regional, one of the im
portant things for the Cardinal will
be to get off to a fast start using its
talented depth, particularly in the
matchups lower in the lineups in
which Stanford will likely have a tal
ent advantage.
Stanford will begin seeking the
16th NCAA team title in program
history and will look to improve on
its 103-19 postseason record when it
travels to Waco this weekend for its
first-round matchup against Itilsa,
which is set to start at 9 a.m. on Sat
urday.
