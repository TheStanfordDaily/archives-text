## Men seek to take it slow through tourney

"Survive and advance."
That motto, coined by former North
Carolina State basketball coach Jim Val
vano during the Wolfpack's miraculous
championship run in 1983, is what Stanford
men's tennis head coach John Whitlinger is
focusing on as the Cardinal prepare to em
bark on their NCAA Championship journey
this weekend.
That's because the No. 27 Cardinal (14-
5,5-2 Pac-12) know that they are capable of
not only hanging around, but also going
swing-for-swing with some of the tennis
heavyweights in the country. When they see
some of those teams in the upcoming tour
nament, it will be all about taking it one
match at a time.

"[Our key is to] just compete hard,"
Whitlinger said. "We've played the best

teams in the country. We've played UCLA
at our place and when that got rained out, it
was going to be really tight, one way or an
other. When we went down there, we got
beat up a little bit but we've played the best
teams in the country and the guys know
what to expect."
Although it defeated some of the better
teams nationally in its strong run at the end
of the regular season but lost to Oregon in
the first round of the Pac-12 Tournament,
all of those matches are now behind the
Stanford team and its focus is just on the
road ahead, starting with Conference USA
champion No. 42 Tulsa (15-12) on Saturday
in its first-round matchup.
"[Ttilsa is] a very talented team too that
we can't overlook," Whitlinger said. "We've
got to be ready to play Saturday morning
and that's the biggest thing to worry
