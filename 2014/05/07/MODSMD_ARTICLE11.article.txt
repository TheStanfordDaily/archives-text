# National title defense kicks off at Taube
## 
### FIONA NOONAN STAFF WRITER 
This weekend, the No. 11 Stanford
women's tennis team (16-2, 8-2 Pac-12) will
begin its national title defense, as the Cardi
nal welcome three teams to the Taube Fam
ily Tennis Center for the first two rounds of
the NCAA Tournament.
Stanford, entering its 33rd consecutive
tournament, has drawn Quinnipiac (13-10,8-
0 MAAC) in the first round and will face the
winner of the match between No. 21 Tulsa
and No. 53 Long Beach State if it advances.
Stanford is coming off a less-than-satis

factory showing at the individual Pac-12
tournament in Ojai, California, where no sin
gles player made it past the quarterfinals in
the main draw. There was one highlight of
the weekend, however, as the No. 9 doubles
pair l of senior Kristie Ahn and freshman
Carol Zhao came away from the tourney
with a runner-up finish.
Now, as team play resumes, the Cardinal
have an opportunity to make up for a third
place conference finish and to win a second
consecutive NCAA title. As the eleventh
seed, Stanford will certainly face tough com-

petition down the road, which could
include Pac-12 rival No. 6 Cal in the
Round of 16.
That said, the Cardinal entered
the tournament at No. 12 last year,
but fought their way through to a
national title. The squad spent the
first month of the regular season
ranked No. 1 in the nation, and
there's no reason they can't reclaim
their place on top.
The team believes it too, and af
ter finishing off the regular season
with a team loss to Cal, there's plen
ty of motivation to recalibrate and
step it up for the NCAAs.
"These NCAAs, it's a whole oth
er mindset compared to dual match
es. You can't lose. If you lose, you're
done," said freshman Taylor David
son.

Despite the high stakes and the
team's relatively low seeding, the
team is overwhelmingly excited at
this point, and with good reason.
Stanford's entire lineup qualified for
the singles portion of the tourna
ment, and Ahn/Zhao made it into the
doubles draw as the ninth seed. As a
result, the whole team will fight to
gether for the title, including the
three freshmen Zhao, Davidson
and Caroline Doyle—who have
been rock-solid in the rotation all
season long.

In some ways, the whole team
making it in will give the tourna
ment especially on the individual
side an air of normalcy as all the
Cardinal hang together. With the
NCAAs, though, the team mentality
is markedly different than it was at
the end of conference dual play or
even in the Pae-12 Individual Cham
pionships.
"You can just feel it; there's some
kind of electricity in the air," David
son said. "You can just tell that
everyone is going to do what they
need to do in order for us to have the
outcome that we want."
That outcome, of course, is a
championship, and that goal has con
sumed the team every day since the
end of the regular season. The team
has put up a countdown to the tour
nament on a whiteboard in their
locker room, below which they have
written, "How will you make your
self better today?" It's a motivation
al reminder that keeps them focused
on the most important phase of the
season.
The biggest challenge for Stan
ford may actually be maintaining fo
cus through the first rounds against
lower-seeded teams they haven't
faced before. Quinnipiac, the Metro
Atlantic Athletic Conference cham
pion, is making its first NCAA Tour
nament appearance since 2011 after
receiving its conference's automatic
bid.

"It's kind of like a test to see just
how badly we want it," Davidson
said. "[Either] we blow them away

or it's like, 'Oh, we weren't ready like
we thought we were.'"
Bobcat junior Jacqueline Raynor,
who spent the season at the number
one doubles and singles spot for the
Bobcats and finished with one of
Quinnipiac's best dual records at 13-
7, leads the team coming into the
postseason. However, if the Bobcats'
overall middle-of-the road perform
ance from conference play contin
ues, they should pose little threat to
the Cardinal.
If all goes according to plan and
the Cardinal do blow their first op
ponent away, the team will begin
second-round play on Saturday,
where a victory will send them on to
Athens, Georgia, for the Round of
16. The individual portion of the
tournament for which the brack
et has not yet been released—will
begin May 21 in Athens separately
from the team component.
The road to the postseason has
been long and somewhat bumpy of
late for the Cardinal, but the squad
may be primed to peak at just the
right time.
"It's what we've been playing for
this whole year," Davidson said.
"We're all pretty excited."
The Cardinal's first-round
matchup against Quinnipiac is set
for 2 p.m. on Friday at the Taube
Family Tennis Stadium, shortly af
ter the 11 a.m. contest between Tul
sa and Long Beach State.

kind of electricity in the air," David
son said. "You can just tell that
everyone is going to do what they
need to do in order for us to have the
outcome that we want."
That outcome, of course, is a
championship, and that goal has con
sumed the team every day since the
end of the regular season. The team
has put up a countdown to the tour
nament on a whiteboard in their
locker room, below which they have
written, "How will you make your
self better today?" It's a motivation
al reminder that keeps them focused
on the most important phase of the
season.
The biggest challenge for Stan
ford may actually be maintaining fo
cus through the first rounds against
lower-seeded teams they haven't
faced before. Quinnipiac, the Metro
Atlantic Athletic Conference cham
pion, is making its first NCAA Tour
nament appearance since 2011 after
receiving its conference's automatic
bid.

"It's kind of like a test to see just
how badly we want it," Davidson
said. "[Either] we blow them away

or it's like, 'Oh, we weren't ready like
we thought we were.'"
Bobcat junior Jacqueline Raynor,
who spent the season at the number
one doubles and singles spot for the
Bobcats and finished with one of
Quinnipiac's best dual records at 13-
7, leads the team coming into the
postseason. However, if the Bobcats'
overall middle-of-the road perform
ance from conference play contin
ues, they should pose little threat to
the Cardinal.
If all goes according to plan and
the Cardinal do blow their first op
ponent away, the team will begin
second-round play on Saturday,
where a victory will send them on to
Athens, Georgia, for the Round of
16. The individual portion of the
tournament for which the brack
et has not yet been released—will
begin May 21 in Athens separately
from the team component.
The road to the postseason has
been long and somewhat bumpy of
late for the Cardinal, but the squad
may be primed to peak at just the
right time.
"It's what we've been playing for
this whole year," Davidson said.
"We're all pretty excited."
The Cardinal's first-round
matchup against Quinnipiac is set
for 2 p.m. on Friday at the Taube
Family Tennis Stadium, shortly af
ter the 11 a.m. contest between Tul
sa and Long Beach State.

This weekend, the No. 11 Stanford
women's tennis team (16-2, 8-2 Pac-12) will
begin its national title defense, as the Cardi
nal welcome three teams to the Taube Fam
ily Tennis Center for the first two rounds of
the NCAA Tournament.
Stanford, entering its 33rd consecutive
tournament, has drawn Quinnipiac (13-10,8-
0 MAAC) in the first round and will face the
winner of the match between No. 21 Tulsa
and No. 53 Long Beach State if it advances.
Stanford is coming off a less-than-satis

factory showing at the individual Pac-12
tournament in Ojai, California, where no sin

the main draw. There was one highlight of
the weekend, however, as the No. 9 doubles

Carol Zhao came away from the tourney
with a runner-up finish.
Now, as team play resumes, the Cardinal

seed, Stanford will certainly face tough com-

petition down the road, which could
include Pac-12 rival No. 6 Cal in the
Round of 16.
That said, the Cardinal entered
the tournament at No. 12 last year,
but fought their way through to a
national title. The squad spent the
first month of the regular season
ranked No. 1 in the nation, and
there's no reason they can't reclaim
their place on top.
The team believes it too, and af
ter finishing off the regular season
with a team loss to Cal, there's plen
ty of motivation to recalibrate and
step it up for the NCAAs.
"These NCAAs, it's a whole oth
er mindset compared to dual match
es. You can't lose. If you lose, you're
done," said freshman Taylor David
son.

Despite the high stakes and the
team's relatively low seeding, the
team is overwhelmingly excited at
this point, and with good reason.
Stanford's entire lineup qualified for
the singles portion of the tourna
ment, and Ahn/Zhao made it into the
doubles draw as the ninth seed. As a
result, the whole team will fight to
gether for the title, including the
three freshmen Zhao, Davidson
and Caroline Doyle—who have
been rock-solid in the rotation all
season long.

In some ways, the whole team
making it in will give the tourna
ment especially on the individual
side an air of normalcy as all the
Cardinal hang together. With the
NCAAs, though, the team mentality
is markedly different than it was at
the end of conference dual play or
even in the Pae-12 Individual Cham
pionships.
