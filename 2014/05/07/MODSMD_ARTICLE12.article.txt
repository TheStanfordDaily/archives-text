## SEEING GREEN Sex on the beach 
### Holly Moeller 
For years, I dreamed of see
ing a baby sea turtle. I've
swum with dozens of juve
niles and one or two behemoths
over the years in several differ
ent oceanic basins. But I was still
missing that nature-documentary
experience of watching a nest full
of hatchlings scurry across the
beach into the sea.
I never thought that my first
baby sea turtle sighting would be
one of the saddest memories of my
life.
Dad and I were wandering
down a beach on Moloka'i, one of
the least developed Hawaiian is
lands, when we discovered the
hatchling, which couldn't have
been more than a few days old.
Hatchlings are supposed to head to
water as soon as they can, but the
infant turtle was being tumbled
around by the waves splashing at
the edge of the beach, seemingly
unable to orient itself and swim out
to sea. There was no sign of a nest
or siblings.
It was abundantly clear that
this turtle was not going to make it.
It was on its last legs, too exhaust
ed to do more than blink once or
twice when a particularly strong
wave finally forced it up the beach
beyond the lapping ocean. I felt my
heart break.
Dad reminded me that this
hatchling was still a sign of hope:
Somewhere, a whole nestful of
brothers and sisters had success
fully hatched. While this turtle
would be one of the many hatch
lings that don't survive that initial,
high-mortality period, some of its
siblings had likely made it out to
the relative safety of the sea.
As usual, Dad was right.
Even so, many hatchlings are
not expected to survive to maturi
ty, and in fact most sea turtles are
endangered, so ensuring successful
nesting is a major conservation
goal. Many turtle-nesting beaches
are afforded extra protections and
monitoring because every popula
tion source is vital.
Yet in a few years, even ensur
ing the safety of every single turtle
nest might not be enough.
That's because climate change
is warming the beaches on which
the turtles nest and, as a result, po
tentially changing the sex ratio of
the turtles that hatch out of those
nests.
Turtles are reptiles, so their
body temperatures and physiolo
gies are affected by the ambient
temperature of their environment.
Unlike humans, who have X and Y
sex chromosomes that determine
biological sex, turtle gender is con
trolled by the temperature of the
nest in which its egg is incubated.
The girls like it hot, so warmer
nests mean relatively more female
turtles than males.
Climate change is expected to
skew the turtle population's sex ra
tio: Future turtle generations,
hatched on warmer beaches, are
going to be increasingly dominated
by females.
But if the sex ratio is going to be
skewed, perhaps that's the best di
rection it could go in. Sea turtles
don't pair for life like, say, alba
trosses. So a single male turtle
could potentially mate with multi
ple females, compensating for a
male-female ratio that is no longer
1:1.
Scientists are already finding

evidence that behavioral compen
sation may play a role in sea turtle
biology. According to one study,
males return to the waters off
shore of key breeding beaches
more frequently than females do,
allowing each male to do the work
of several.
Over time, natural selection will
likely also act to counteract the sex
imbalance. Those females whose
eggs produce a more balanced sex
ratio, even at warmer tempera
tures, will produce sons who are
more reproductively successful,
thus passing on those warm-adapt
ed genes. And sea turtles may also
begin to expand their breeding
ranges poleward, nesting on beach
es that were previously too cold but
now are just right for producing a
crop of boys.
But will all this happen in time?
Thanks to human activity the cli
mate is changing at an unprece
dented rate even within the
scope of sea turtles' ancient evolu
tionary lineage. And since it takes
decades for turtles to reach repro
ductive maturity shifting sex ra
tios in the breeding population will
lag behind nest temperatures by
many years. That's why it's impor
tant to do everything we can to re
duce other pressures on sea turtle
populations pressures such as
lighting hazards that distract
hatchlings from heading toward
the water, or fishing nets that snarl
older turtles at sea so that pop
ulations are as healthy as they can
be in the face of this new threat.
For my part, although I am a bi
ologist and know something of the
ways of death, I couldn't stand the
thought of leaving one baby turtle
stranded and helpless on the
beach. While Dad waited on the
shore, I swam, turtle resting on my
belly backstroking out past the
breakers toward the mouth of the
cove. I left the turtle there, bob
bing upright and lifting its head
every couple of moments to take a
breath, hoping for a miracle that
would be impossible on the shore.

down a beach on Moloka'i, one of
the least developed Hawaiian is
lands, when we discovered the
hatchling, which couldn't have
been more than a few days old.
Hatchlings are supposed to head to
water as soon as they can, but the
infant turtle was being tumbled
around by the waves splashing at
the edge of the beach, seemingly
unable to orient itself and swim out
to sea. There was no sign of a nest
or siblings.
It was abundantly clear that
this turtle was not going to make it.
It was on its last legs, too exhaust
ed to do more than blink once or
twice when a particularly strong
wave finally forced it up the beach
beyond the lapping ocean. I felt my
heart break.
Dad reminded me that this
hatchling was still a sign of hope:
Somewhere, a whole nestful of
brothers and sisters had success
fully hatched. While this turtle
would be one of the many hatch
lings that don't survive that initial,
high-mortality period, some of its
siblings had likely made it out to
the relative safety of the sea.
As usual, Dad was right.
Even so, many hatchlings are
not expected to survive to maturi
ty, and in fact most sea turtles are
endangered, so ensuring successful
nesting is a major conservation
goal. Many turtle-nesting beaches
are afforded extra protections and
monitoring because every popula
tion source is vital.
Yet in a few years, even ensur
ing the safety of every single turtle
nest might not be enough.
That's because climate change
is warming the beaches on which
the turtles nest and, as a result, po
tentially changing the sex ratio of
the turtles that hatch out of those
nests.
Turtles are reptiles, so their
body temperatures and physiolo
gies are affected by the ambient
temperature of their environment.
Unlike humans, who have X and Y
sex chromosomes that determine
biological sex, turtle gender is con
trolled by the temperature of the
nest in which its egg is incubated.
The girls like it hot, so warmer
nests mean relatively more female
turtles than males.
Climate change is expected to
skew the turtle population's sex ra
tio: Future turtle generations,
hatched on warmer beaches, are
going to be increasingly dominated
by females.
But if the sex ratio is going to be
skewed, perhaps that's the best di
rection it could go in. Sea turtles
don't pair for life like, say, alba
trosses. So a single male turtle
could potentially mate with multi
ple females, compensating for a
male-female ratio that is no longer
1:1.
Scientists are already finding

evidence that behavioral compen
sation may play a role in sea turtle
biology. According to one study,
males return to the waters off
shore of key breeding beaches
more frequently than females do,
allowing each male to do the work
of several.
Over time, natural selection will
likely also act to counteract the sex
imbalance. Those females whose
eggs produce a more balanced sex
ratio, even at warmer tempera
tures, will produce sons who are
more reproductively successful,
thus passing on those warm-adapt
ed genes. And sea turtles may also
begin to expand their breeding
ranges poleward, nesting on beach
es that were previously too cold but
now are just right for producing a
crop of boys.
But will all this happen in time?
Thanks to human activity the cli
mate is changing at an unprece
dented rate even within the
scope of sea turtles' ancient evolu
tionary lineage. And since it takes
decades for turtles to reach repro
ductive maturity shifting sex ra
tios in the breeding population will
lag behind nest temperatures by
many years. That's why it's impor
tant to do everything we can to re
duce other pressures on sea turtle
populations pressures such as
lighting hazards that distract
hatchlings from heading toward
the water, or fishing nets that snarl
older turtles at sea so that pop
ulations are as healthy as they can
be in the face of this new threat.
For my part, although I am a bi
ologist and know something of the
ways of death, I couldn't stand the
thought of leaving one baby turtle
stranded and helpless on the
beach. While Dad waited on the
shore, I swam, turtle resting on my
belly backstroking out past the
breakers toward the mouth of the
cove. I left the turtle there, bob
bing upright and lifting its head
every couple of moments to take a
breath, hoping for a miracle that
would be impossible on the shore.

For years, I dreamed of see
ing a baby sea turtle. I've
swum with dozens of juve
niles and one or two behemoths
over the years in several differ
ent oceanic basins. But I was still
missing that nature-documentary
experience of watching a nest full
of hatchlings scurry across the
beach into the sea.
I never thought that my first
baby sea turtle sighting would be
one of the saddest memories of my
life.
