# FROM THE OPINIONS DESK
## On NATO and the European Union 
### Winston Shi 
The two defining institutions of
postwar Europe have been
the North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization and the European
Union. Both of them are originally
Western European entities, and
their expansion into Eastern Eu
rope was one of the foundational
changes that solidified the end of the
Cold War on the map and in the pub
lic mind.
Although the expansion of these
institutions has seemingly gone
hand in hand, popular perceptions of
each have trended in opposite direc
tions. Having survived a series of fi
nancial crises culminating in the
bailout of Greece, the European
Union seems more robust than ever.
At the same time, the demise of the
Soviet Union has led people to con
sistently question the point of NA
TO's military alliance, even as
France reintegrates with NATO's
military command and more re
cently— Eastern European states
request America to reaffirm its se
curity guarantee.
If NATO is viewed as a relic of
the Cold War in the public eye, then
the EU is supposed to be Europe's
future —an integrated Continent
where nations that share the same
economic and moral principles can
enjoy collective policies of mutual
benefit and assistance. The EU is
explicitly not a military organiza
tion, whereas NATO by definition is.
So, in a time of relative peace it is
hardly surprising that NATO is be
ing questioned.
In reality, however, we tend to
confuse events with potential, espe
cially when alliances are generally
formed in peacetime and rarely in
the midst of war. The potential for
conflict is why the Atlantic Alliance
exists in the first place. NATO does
not become more important in reali
ty because Russia is flexing its mus
cles right now: It has always been
important because Russia has al
ways had the ability to flex its mus
cles, and now that Russia's strength
is recovering (although not invinci
ble), it is all the more important at
present.

Russia has invaded a country, and
America has flexed its muscles too.
Nobody thinks that a 600-man com
mitment to Eastern Europe in the
wake of the Russian invasion of
Crimea will stop an army, but they
carry the American flag and the im
plicit protection of the United States.
But do 600 men make an army?

Certainly not.
If Russia invades the Baltic
States, the Americans won't be able
to stop them. The point of the Amer
icans is to make any invasion an act
of war, but that's a domestic political
tactic. The definition of an "act of
war" is blurry because it is the
American government that decides
what constitutes an act of war
against the United States. And
America doesn't need to declare
something an unacceptable provoca
tion if it doesn't want to.

What if Russia plays to the
American crowd, one that is weary
of war? The Economist cites that 52
percent of Americans would like
America to "mind its own business."
The nations in question have long
held ties to Russia, especially
Ukraine, as highlighted in this very
paper: What if Russia offers Ameri
ca and the EU a split of Ukraine? To
many, the calm certainty of a peace
ful split might be preferable to a civ
il war- with an unpredictable out
come.

Indeed, we may well be seeing
this happen right now. NATO's top
military commander in Europe
points out that Russian special
forces are operating in eastern
Ukraine, supporting the pro-Russia
revolts. Russian regular troops have
not formally invaded Ukraine, but
right now they don't need to. While
it's eminently possible that the
Ukrainian government is trying to
accentuate its failings in order to
generate American support, it
seems reasonably accurate for the
president of Ukraine to admit that
his defenses are "hopeless." A split
might be achieved without interna
tional bloodshed.

And he has his own considera
tions at hand that have solidified his
own resolve. One only needs to re
member the chaos of the Cuban Mis
sile Crisis to imagine how Americans
would respond if Russian influence
extended to America's doorstep.
Even if the European Union
again, not a military organization
is extending its hand to Ukraine
purely as a sign of friendship, it's
hard to imagine how Russia could
possibly be happy about that. And
now America has placed boots on the
ground, right on the Russian border.
No matter how well-meaning to
wards America's allies this action
may be, it has also upped the ten
sions in the region.

As America engages in a kind of
brinksmanship itself, we need to ask
the hard question: What would we
do about our 600 men in East
ern Europe? NATO commits the
United States and the rest of the al
liance to defend its members from
attack, but as I've said, in the short
run the Baltic States would be im
mediately overrun. President Oba
ma would be presented with a fait
accompli, unless he does the un
thinkable and uses nuclear weapons
and that idea is so out of the ques
tion that it's just silly. The American
commitment would then be to not
only conventionally defend the other
NATO states but to retake the terri
tory of the Baltics, either by treaty
or by force of arms.

Let's apply the Ukraine question
to NATO, then. Imagine that Presi
dent Putin chooses to go further.
What if Russia promises freedom
for captured POWs and some kind
of Hong Kong-style autonomy for

the Baltic States? But that implies
that Russia would think it could go
further and still remain in the inter
national system's good graces,
which is unlikely. Far more likely:
What if Russia extends control over
the Baltics and simply promises to
stand pat?

Through his admittedly bold ac
tions, Putin has already proven that
he is willing to defy conventions of
international conduct in order to
achieve his goals. Russia may not
even need to invade in order to bul
ly other nations into entering the
Russian sphere. If Russia is capable
and willing to invade regardless
of the consequences and America
is not capable of liberation, then
Baltic acquiescence to their larger
neighbor would only be natural. The
Baltics would have to formally with
draw from NATO and, as Friedman
remarks on Ukraine, "cut the best
deal with Putin that [they] can."
That deal would involve Russian
guarantees of Baltic security. It
would also deny them the European
Union.

The events of the last few months
have shown that social and economic
attitudes and military force aren't
separate worlds at all. The Euro
pean Union attempted to deepen
links with Ukraine; Russia respond
ed with a counteroffer. Euromaidan
erupted in revolt; Russia responded
with force.
Lest we think that the West is dif
ferent: This relationship extends to
the so-called "Western sphere" as
well. The European Union exists as
a framework for European coopera
tion, but it doesn't exist as a frame
work for the application of military
force, and it won't. As French NATO
ambassador Francois de Rose point
ed out, the EU exists in its form be
cause the American military guaran
tee to the Continent lessens the
longstanding geopolitical differences
that would cause a NATO-less EU to
fragment. Put simply, the EU organ
izing by itself for its common defense
is difficult to imagine. As de Rose
wisely said, "The frequently sterile
arguments within the European
Community on subjects like agricul
tural policy or budget contributions
scarcely incline one to believe that
governments would be inclined to
hand over to anyone else the defense
of their truly vital interests."
These words are true, and they
don't stop being true because the na
tions of the EU are now worried
about a potentially common enemy;
rather, they reinforce it. The EU has
been helpful in many ways, working
towards energy independence
specifically, the breakup of dominant,
vertically integrated energy produc
ers like Gazprom that can threaten
the economy of the entire continent.
But even if the EU is united with
in, the only issue that could force the
EU together militarily outweighs its
nations' military power. The EU's
commendable measures need to be
backed with the force of arms
arms that the EU cannot by itself
provide, except at a terrible cost to
its own way of life. Europe needs
the United States, and it needs NA
TO. And if America will be a part of
NATO, it needs to honor its own
commitments, work with the EU to
secure fair treatment given its mili
tary assistance, and above all make
sure that its military commitments
do not outpace its own capacity for
projecting power.

We've seen that NATO is as im
portant as ever. But we should have
known that all along. Hopefully, this
time we won't forget the lessons we
have learned.
