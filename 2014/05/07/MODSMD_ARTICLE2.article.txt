## ASSU talks Ike's Place, funding Senate supports resolution to maintain Ike's on campus 
### PETER MOON DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
The second meeting of the 16th Un
dergraduate Senate focused on recent
problems associated with group fund
ing and the possibility of forming polit
ical unions at Stanford, as well as a
resolution supporting the continued
presence of popular eatery Ike's Place
on campus.
In recent weeks, a number of stu
dent organizations have expressed dis
content about not receiving promised
general fees funding, in a continuation
of issues the 15th Senate faced in its
last few weeks. Some groups have
even spent money nominally allocated
to them by the ASSU but have yet to
receive reimbursement.
The current Senate has approxi

Student Enterprise Capital Group

money from the buffer funds.

the 16th Senate does we want to make
sure it is possible to do in the next four
or five years," Olivia Moore said. "We
are uncomfortable with spending mon
ey on programs [general fees funding]
that aren't for those [purposes]."
However, some senators argued
that SSE should give the Senate rec
ommendations and not orders
on financial matters.
Subsequently, Senator Anthony
Ghosn 'l6 asked other Senators their
opinions on creating a political union at
Stanford, in an effort to encourage the
development of debate forums.
"I genuinely believe we don't have a
vibrant enough open forum debate so

Ghosn said. "Working with Stanford in
