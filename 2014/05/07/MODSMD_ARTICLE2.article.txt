## ASSU talks Ike's Place, funding Senate supports resolution to maintain Ike's on campus 
### PETER MOON DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
The second meeting of the 16th Un
dergraduate Senate focused on recent
problems associated with group fund
ing and the possibility of forming polit
ical unions at Stanford, as well as a
resolution supporting the continued
presence of popular eatery Ike's Place
on campus.
In recent weeks, a number of stu
dent organizations have expressed dis
content about not receiving promised
general fees funding, in a continuation
of issues the 15th Senate faced in its
last few weeks. Some groups have
even spent money nominally allocated
to them by the ASSU but have yet to
receive reimbursement.
The current Senate has approxi
mately $lO,OOO in outstanding funding
that it can allocate but must meet the
$13,000 in funds approved for stu
dents. Furthermore, a couple of stu
dent groups have expressed discon
tent over certain takebacks, which
lowered the amount of money avail
able for spring-quarter funding.
Senators discussed possible solu
tions to spring quarter general fees
funding issues, including whether
money should be taken from the buffer
fund reserves.
However, newly elected Stanford
Student Enterprise Capital Group
(SSE) assistant financial managers
Olivia Moore 'l6 and Justine Moore
'l6, strongly advised against using the
money from the buffer funds.
"We are concerned about the viabil
ity of ASSU's future, so anything that
the 16th Senate does we want to make
sure it is possible to do in the next four
or five years," Olivia Moore said. "We
are uncomfortable with spending mon
ey on programs [general fees funding]
that aren't for those [purposes]."
However, some senators argued
that SSE should give the Senate rec
ommendations and not orders
on financial matters.
Subsequently, Senator Anthony
Ghosn 'l6 asked other Senators their
opinions on creating a political union at
Stanford, in an effort to encourage the
development of debate forums.
"I genuinely believe we don't have a
vibrant enough open forum debate so
ciety like Oxford or Yale University,"
Ghosn said. "Working with Stanford in
Government (SIG) and Stanford De-
mocrats, under the auspices
of [a] Political Union, we may
create events for students to
get more involved, informed
and debate about politics."
The final item on the
agenda was a discussion
about the Resolution in Sup
port of Ike's Place.
Authored by Senators
Andrew Aude 'l6 and John-
Lancaster Finley 'l6, the bill
urges the bidding criteria
and process of selecting the

future occupant of the space
currently occupied by Ike's
Place in Huang Engineering
Center to be more transpar
ent and public.
"There is lots of blame
shifting revolving around
the committee [which con
ducted the bidding] and
R&DE [Residential & Din
ing Enterprises] and there's
lots of indirection and ambi
guity," Aude said. "Ike's did
n't even know they lost the
bid although R&DE was no
tified that they tentatively
won the bid in March."
Aude and other senators
argued that students could
n't have voiced their opinion

earlier in the year, given that
there was no knowledge of
R&DE having placed a bid
for the location currently oc
cupied by Ike's Place until
recently.
Although the bill ex
presses support for Ike's
and posits that there
should be no ambiguity in
future lease-bids of restau
rants or cafes at the Uni
versity, it does not officially
seek to compel R&DE to
change their decision about
establishing an outlet in
Huang.
