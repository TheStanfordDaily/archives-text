# University divests from coal companies
## 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford University
Board of Trustees announced
yesterday that the University
will no longer directly invest en
dowment funds in coal mining
companies, making Stanford the
first major American university
to take such a step.
The Board's decision reflects
an endorsement of the Advisory
Panel on Investment Responsi
bility and Licensing (APIRL)'s

position that divesting from coal
extraction companies is consis
tent with the obligations outlined
in Stanford's Statement on In
vestment Responsibility.
While that statement identi
fies the primary obligation of the
trustees in managing the endow
ment as maximizing financial re
turns, it also states that if
trustees judge that "corporate
policies or practices create sub
stantial social injury" they can
weigh that factor in making in
vestment decisions.
"Stanford has a responsibility

as a global citizen to promote sus
tainability for our planet," said
President John Hennessy in a
statement accompanying the an
nouncement. "The university's
review has concluded that coal is
one of the most carbon-intensive
methods of energy generation
and that other sources can be
readily substituted for it. Moving
away from coal in the investment
context is a small, but construc
tive, step while work continues,

Fossil Free Stanford members have repeatedly called on the University to divest from investments
in fossil fuels. The Board of Trustees announced on Tuesday that the University will no longer invest
endowment funds in coal mining companies and will divest from current holdings in those firms.
at Stanford and elsewhere,
to develop broadly viable
sustainable energy solutions
for the future."
As of August 2013, Stan
ford's investment has a value
of approximately $18.7 bil
lion. While Stanford does not
disclose specific investments
or their value, the resolution
stipulates that the Universi
ty stop directly investing in
approximately 100 publicly
traded companies that focus
on coal extraction and that it
divest of any current hold
ings in those firms.
In addition to divesting
any direct investments,
Stanford is also recommend
ing that its external invest
ment managers, who invest
in wide ranges of securities
on behalf of the University,
avoid investments in coal
mining companies.
According to University
spokesperson Lisa Lapin,
Stanford will begin the divest
ment process immediately.
Fossil Free Stanford
The decision to divest fol
lows an organized campaign
by the student group Fossil
FYee Stanford. Last year, the
group petitioned the Univer
sity to divest from over 200
fossil-fuel extraction compa
nies and it has worked with
the APIRL since to make
the case that investing in fos
sil fuel companies is socially
irresponsible.
According to Board Chair

Steven Denning MBA '7B,
Fossil Free Stanford "cat
alyzed an important discus
sion" about the University's
investments.
"We believe this action
provides leadership on a crit
ical matter facing our world
and is an appropriate appli
cation of the University's in
vestment responsibility poli
cy," Denning told the Stan
ford News Service.
According to Lapin, the
APIRL made the recommen
dation to divest from coal
mining companies last month.
The Board of Trustees' vote
was conducted by telephone
yesterday.
Members of Fossil Free
Stanford said that they had
n't expected the Board to
make a decision before its
June meeting. However,
University officials notified
the group late last week that
a decision was imminent and
administrators personally
notified the group members
of the decision just prior to
the public announcement
yesterday afternoon.
Building a coalition
Earlier this year, the stu
dent body passed a resolu
tion sponsored by Fossil
Free Stanford supporting di
vestment from fossil fuels,
with the measure garnering
78 percent of votes in favor.
"The referendum was
generally symbolic but it
showed that students were
united about something in a
way that they don't usually
get united," said Michael
Penuelas 'l5, a student or
ganizer of Fossil FYee Stan
ford. "It was really powerful

because it took student voic
es and magnified them to the
institutional level."
The same week the reso
lution passed, Fossil Free
Stanford delivered over 200
letters from alumni to Hen
nessy's office.
Yari Greaney 'l5, another
student organizer of Fossil
Free Stanford, emphasized
the group's efforts to create
a coalition of students, facul
ty and alumni against invest
ment in fossil fuels.
"We really appreciate that
Stanford does have these
channels open to us," Greaney
said. "We can communicate
our concerns to the advisory
panel and we can move our
concerns along to the Board of
Trustees. We're glad that
that's an opportunity that's
open to us and we are happy
to take advantage of that."
A major step
While the student body's
support for a resolution
backing divestment from
fossil fuels followed the ex
ample of student bodies at
several peer institutions, the
University's decision to offi
cially divest made Stanford
the first major American
university to do so.
In the past week, mean
while, students at Harvard
and Washington University
in Saint Louis were arrested
for protesting in favor of di
vestment. Administrators at
other schools such as Yale
and Brown have also thus far
rejected divestment, even af
ter their student bodies
passed referendums in sup
port of the action.

Members of Fossil Free

Stanford expressed hope
that Stanford's decision will
stimulate broader action.
Greaney said her group
doesn't just see this as a first
step in the divestment
process but as a major step
in the climate movement.
"We want to really cele
brate this and put it in a big
ger context than just a di
vestment campaign, because

divestment is a strategy and
fighting climate change is
what we are working to
ward," Greaney said.
Greaney added that Fos
sil Fuel Stanford's central
goal remains divestment
from all fossil fuels.
"The entire fossil fuel in
dustry is predicated on a
business model that is in
compatible with the climate

and we will continue to ask
that our administrators don't
fund an industry that pol
lutes our world," Greaney
said. "The Board seems open
to further divestment so
we're excited to use this as a
really strong and very pow
erful starting place."
