# University divests from coal companies
## 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford University
Board of Trustees announced
yesterday that the University
will no longer directly invest en
dowment funds in coal mining
companies, making Stanford the
first major American university
to take such a step.
The Board's decision reflects
an endorsement of the Advisory
Panel on Investment Responsi
bility and Licensing (APIRL)'s

position that divesting from coal
extraction companies is consis
tent with the obligations outlined
in Stanford's Statement on In
vestment Responsibility.
While that statement identi
fies the primary obligation of the
trustees in managing the endow
ment as maximizing financial re
turns, it also states that if
trustees judge that "corporate
policies or practices create sub
stantial social injury" they can
weigh that factor in making in
vestment decisions.
"Stanford has a responsibility

as a global citizen to promote sus
tainability for our planet," said
President John Hennessy in a
statement accompanying the an
nouncement. "The university's
review has concluded that coal is
one of the most carbon-intensive
methods of energy generation
and that other sources can be
readily substituted for it. Moving
away from coal in the investment
context is a small, but construc
tive, step while work continues,

Fossil Free Stanford members have repeatedly called on the University to divest from investments
in fossil fuels. The Board of Trustees announced on Tuesday that the University will no longer invest
endowment funds in coal mining companies and will divest from current holdings in those firms.
