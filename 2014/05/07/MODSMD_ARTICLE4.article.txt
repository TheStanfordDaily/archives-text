## Pi Phi event adapts after controversy Sorority fundraiser generates dialogue on cultured sensitivity 
### MARSHALL WATKINS EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
Following Monday's protests over
alleged cultural appropriations of Cin
co de Mayo's Mexican heritage, both
the organizers and critics of "Pi Phies
ta" the Pi Beta Phi fundraising
event that served as a flashpoint for
many protestors have expressed
optimism that a recent dialogue may
have set the tone for more appropriate
celebrations of the day in the future.
Concerned students initially sought
to meet with members of Pi Beta Phi
and University administrators last
week, after becoming aware of the
event's theme and programming.
"We voiced our concerns about the
event and how we were worried [that]
if the event... [was] run a certain way,
it might be culturally insensitive," said
Brenda Munoz 'l4. "[lt's] typical of
things that go on during Cinco de
Mayo."
Munoz framed the decision to
broach the issue of cultural appropria
tions of Cinco de Mayo's heritage this
year as reflective of a broader national
trend.
"People have been speaking up all
over the country," Munoz said, noting
that similar events have elicited con
troversy at Dartmouth and UC-
Berkeley. "We felt this was a good mo
ment to speak up."
Pi Beta Phi president Raena
Sumiyoshi 'l5 emphasized that the
event has taken place annually for a
number of years.
"It's our biggest fundraiser, where
all of our donations go to your national
philanthropy," she said. "[Our] chef
works with us to provide all the food
typically Mexican-themed food and
we invite the whole Stanford commu
nity."
Sumiyoshi framed the meeting be
tween the event's organizers and con
cerned students as constructive.
"I first started offering an explana
tion of where we were coming from
the history of the event and our
fundraiser and they all had the op
portunity to speak about their specific
concerns," she recalled. "We [then]
brainstormed ideas about solutions."
Following the meeting, the event's
organizers changed the theme to "Pi
Beta Paradise."
Munoz expressed optimism that
this year's dialogue may prompt a
more lasting move away
from programming that
could be construed as cultur
ally appropriative.
"If we bring up these is
sues now, we can institution

alize it so that it doesn't hap
pen [again]," she said.
Sumiyoshi struck a simi
lar tone, noting that her
sorority internally dis
cussed the potential issues
behind the original theme
as well.
"We're learning a lot
right now and we will never
be going back to [Pi Phies
ta]," she said. "[We] will

probably still have a
fundraiser every quarter but
it will be a new theme to
stick with... This is a greater
stepping stone for broader
conversation in the future."
