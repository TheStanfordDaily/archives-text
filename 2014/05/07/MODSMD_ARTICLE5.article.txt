## Faculty petition for book delivery Faculty Senate subcommittee to discuss concerns about library services on May 14 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
A petition calling on the University to develop and
implement a book and document delivery service has
gained 110 signatures from faculty and graduate stu
dents in a month, with many signatories arguing that
such a service is a basic need for many researchers in the
humanities and social sciences.
According to Assistant Professor of History Jennifer
Burns, such a service —which would deliver a request
ed book from the library directly to a departmental office
would save time and money for researchers who rely
heavily on books for information.
"I'm just buying them on Amazon because they'll de
liver in two days to my door or I'm asking a research as
sistant, paying a student to do work, [when] I prefer to
pay them to do something more intellectual stimulating,
but [retrieving books is] my most immediate need,"
Burns said, adding that obtaining books could take up to
45 minutes each.
In December 2012, Stanford University Libraries
had sent out an evaluation survey asking faculty for eval-

uations of the facilities, in
cluding any suggestions of
what services could be added
to improve faculty experience
using the libraries. Although
book retrieval and document
delivery was promised for
implementation earlier this
year, according to Burns, in
winter quarter she was told
by library representatives
that installing the service
was no longer possible due to
a lack of funding.
Following that change in
plans, Burns and Assistant
Professor of History Mikael
Wolfe wrote the petition in
order to raise awareness
about the request and ensure
that faculty members' voices
were heard.

"We're petitioning to jump
start a conversation about this
and make it a matter of ur
gency, not just one that can be
tabled," Wolfe said.
Karen Wigen, chair of the
Department of History and a
petition signatory, supported
the University's investment
in a book delivery service.
"If the administration tru
ly wants to support the pro
ductivity of Stanford's world
class faculty, creating a book
retrieval service is a smart
investment," Wigen wrote in

a statement to The Daily. "I
am sure it will be especially
valuable for junior faculty
who often have precious little
time to browse in the library
stacks given all the other de
mands on their time."
Burns also pointed out
that a number of peer institu
tions in the Ivy League
namely Harvard, Yale and
MIT and even several
more humbly endowed insti
tutions— such as the Uni
versity of Central Florida
have some form of book and
document retrieval system.
"I cannot imagine it is not
within the budgetary and
technical capability of Stan
ford Library," Wolfe said.
"Which is why it really struck
us that the service didn't al
ready exist."
According to Gabrielle
Karampelas, director of com
munications for Stanford
University Libraries, the de
velopment of a book retrieval
system requires more re
sources than might be ex
pected, including hiring more
staff, updating the online cat
alog and maintaining track
ing materials.
"It's more than a bike and
dropping off a book," Karam
pelas said.
Karampelas explained
that requests related to the li
brary system are overseen by
the Committee on Libraries
(C-LIB), a subcommittee of
the Faculty Senate that meets

six times a year and deter
mines which requests will be
carried through.
Approval for a request,
according to Karampelas, de
pends on the scope and the
size of the request, as well as
the current needs of the Uni
versity.
"Our budget is not a
steady state," Karampelas
said. "We have to be fluid so
that we support the greater
Stanford scholarship needs."
Beyond the petition,
Burns and Wolfe have organ
ized a meeting with C-LIB
for May 14, in which they
hope to express their con
cerns in person.

"I think [the library is]
committed absolutely [to
serving the community]. I
feel well supported and do
appreciate what the library
offers," Wolfe said. "I don't
want there to be misunder
standings — we're not dis
satisfied. We're thinking this
service could greatly enhance
the services the library al
ready provides."
"The library is responsive
and is really good about hav
ing the resources to help my
teaching and research,"
Burns said. "And maybe this
is why [the lack of a book re
trieval service is] so glaring
because it's really basic and
fundamental."

According to Gabrielle
Karampelas, director of com
munications for Stanford
University Libraries, the de
velopment of a book retrieval
system requires more re
sources than might be ex
pected, including hiring more
staff, updating the online cat
alog and maintaining track
ing materials.
"It's more than a bike and
dropping off a book," Karam

Karampelas explained
that requests related to the li
brary system are overseen by
the Committee on Libraries
(C-LIB), a subcommittee of
the Faculty Senate that meets

six times a year and deter
mines which requests will be
carried through.
Approval for a request,
according to Karampelas, de
pends on the scope and the
size of the request, as well as
the current needs of the Uni
versity.
"Our budget is not a
steady state," Karampelas
said. "We have to be fluid so
that we support the greater
Stanford scholarship needs."
Beyond the petition,
Burns and Wolfe have organ

for May 14, in which they
hope to express their con
cerns in person.

"I think [the library is]
committed absolutely [to
serving the community]. I
feel well supported and do
appreciate what the library
offers," Wolfe said. "I don't
want there to be misunder
standings — we're not dis
satisfied. We're thinking this
service could greatly enhance
the services the library al
ready provides."
"The library is responsive
and is really good about hav
ing the resources to help my
teaching and research,"
Burns said. "And maybe this
is why [the lack of a book re
trieval service is] so glaring
because it's really basic and
fundamental."

A petition calling on the University to develop and
implement a book and document delivery service has
gained 110 signatures from faculty and graduate stu
dents in a month, with many signatories arguing that
such a service is a basic need for many researchers in the
humanities and social sciences.
According to Assistant Professor of History Jennifer
Burns, such a service —which would deliver a request
ed book from the library directly to a departmental office
would save time and money for researchers who rely
heavily on books for information.
"I'm just buying them on Amazon because they'll de
liver in two days to my door or I'm asking a research as
sistant, paying a student to do work, [when] I prefer to
pay them to do something more intellectual stimulating,
but [retrieving books is] my most immediate need,"
Burns said, adding that obtaining books could take up to
45 minutes each.
In December 2012, Stanford University Libraries
had sent out an evaluation survey asking faculty for eval-

uations of the facilities, in
cluding any suggestions of
what services could be added
to improve faculty experience
using the libraries. Although
book retrieval and document
delivery was promised for
implementation earlier this
year, according to Burns, in
winter quarter she was told
by library representatives
that installing the service
was no longer possible due to
a lack of funding.
Following that change in
plans, Burns and Assistant
Professor of History Mikael
Wolfe wrote the petition in
order to raise awareness
about the request and ensure
that faculty members' voices
were heard.

"We're petitioning to jump
start a conversation about this
and make it a matter of ur
gency, not just one that can be
tabled," Wolfe said.
Karen Wigen, chair of the
Department of History and a
petition signatory, supported
the University's investment
in a book delivery service.
"If the administration tru
ly wants to support the pro
ductivity of Stanford's world
class faculty, creating a book
retrieval service is a smart
investment," Wigen wrote in

a statement to The Daily. "I
am sure it will be especially
valuable for junior faculty
who often have precious little
time to browse in the library
stacks given all the other de
mands on their time."
Burns also pointed out
that a number of peer institu
tions in the Ivy League
namely Harvard, Yale and
MIT and even several
more humbly endowed insti
tutions— such as the Uni
versity of Central Florida
have some form of book and
document retrieval system.
"I cannot imagine it is not
within the budgetary and
technical capability of Stan
ford Library," Wolfe said.
"Which is why it really struck
us that the service didn't al
ready exist."
