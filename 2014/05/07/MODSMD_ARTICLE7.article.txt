## Discovering a fandom for a new sport 
### Ashley Westhem 
As I was writing the
weekend's rowing re
cap last night and
spending way too much
tine on GoStanford and
texting rowing Mends asking them to
explain different details of the sport
to me, I stalled to feel a little bit
guilty.
Even though I am a huge sports
girl in general, the only sport that I
have ever had great enthusiasm for
coveiing has been women's basket
ball. I felt like I was cheating on bas
ketball by putting so much effort into
my coverage of Stanford rowing. I
guess I've found a sport to dedicate
myself to in the offseason.
And honestly, rowing is such a cool
sport if you take the time to learn the
logistics and terminology. I don't
know when the last time a Daily
sports writer took rowing on as
his/her beat, but for the next two
years â€”at least while I'm here
they'll get coverage.
And so this helps to explain why
for the entirety of last week I counted
down the days and even hours
until Saturday. Yes, I was looking for
ward to Linner like everybody else,
but that's a given. And okay, I was al
so looking forward to the start of
Big/Little Week.
But actually, I was really excited
to go to the annual Big Row against
Cal at Redwood Shores.
Some people warned me that re
gattas aren't as fun as they seem, but
I was just super excited to cheer on
the teams that I had started coveiing
and finally see what it is that my
Mends spend so much time doing and
talking about. (I've come to leam that
basically all that rowers talk about is
rowing.)
I got up super early Saturday
morning and drove to Redwood
shores with my friend who was a
coxswain on the men's team last year
except that she was used to going
straight to the boat house (which is
not where you want to watch the
races from) so we barely made it

there for the start of the light
weights.
I spent the morning scrambling
between taking pictures for The Dai
ly, getting quotes for the recap,
cheering on my Mends and trying to
view the races from every possible
position (there were three).
And what made the day so great
was that I actually knew what was
going on. I talked to a friend, who al
so happens to be a rower's girl Mend,
about the lineups and finishes. People
around us were pretty impressed
that we actually knew what we were
talking about.
Also, it's a veiy different experi
ence and environment than covering
a women's basketball game. I got to
be outside, instead of in a gym stuck
behind the scorer's table, talk to the
coaches in between races, stand right
at the launch site in the wide open, in
terview the rowers right when they
got off the water and enjoy the social
aspect of the sport. So many Stan
ford alumni were there cheering on
the Card and everyone was so invest
ed in the races. Who knew that Stan
ford rowing had such a following?

It was also cool to hear the
coxswains yelling at the rowers to
motivate them and to actually be able
to discern what they were saying.
Seeing these men and women exert
so much energy for a five to seven
minute race and leave it all on the wa
ter was impressive as well. Each boat
stayed on the water for at least an ex
tra fifteen minutes to cool down.
I've been to the end of the men's
training sessions after they've spent
all their energy on a hard erg piece,
and I insist that they sit when I inter
view them because it's apparent it's
hard for them to stand.

But race day brings a whole new
level of emotional and mental exhaus
tion that comes with competition. If
there's one thing I've learned this
year, it's that rowing is a sport that
requires incredible mental strength
especially when the lineups aren't
gelling and it takes a whole season of
seat races to figure out who works
well together. It's a game of mixing
and matching until you find the right
combination of rowers to make the
boat move. When you find that com
bination, it's worth all the frustration
and energy spent to get there.
Meeting someone on the rowing
team last year and slowly meeting
more and more rowers this year was
what piqued my interest in the sport,
but that mental aspect and strategy
involved has kept me hooked.
And then of course my day was
made even more perfect by Linner,
which must have a pretty good repu
tation around the Bay because word
has it that the Cal men's rowing team
dropped off their boats in Berkeley
and then came all the way back to the
Farm. All in all, not a bad Saturday.

Word on the street has it that
Chiney Ogwumike is disappointed
in Ashley for devoting so much at
tention to rowing coverage. To tell
her why she's making Chiney sad,
contact her at awesthem@Stan
ford. edu and Tweet her @ash
west!6.

That mental
aspect and
strategy has
me hooked.
