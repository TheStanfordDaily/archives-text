## Discovering a fandom for a new sport 
### Ashley Westhem 
As I was writing the
weekend's rowing re
cap last night and
spending way too much
tine on GoStanford and
texting rowing Mends asking them to
explain different details of the sport
to me, I stalled to feel a little bit
guilty.
Even though I am a huge sports
girl in general, the only sport that I
have ever had great enthusiasm for
coveiing has been women's basket
ball. I felt like I was cheating on bas
ketball by putting so much effort into
my coverage of Stanford rowing. I
guess I've found a sport to dedicate
myself to in the offseason.
And honestly, rowing is such a cool
sport if you take the time to learn the
logistics and terminology. I don't
know when the last time a Daily
sports writer took rowing on as
his/her beat, but for the next two
years â€”at least while I'm here
they'll get coverage.
And so this helps to explain why
for the entirety of last week I counted
down the days and even hours
until Saturday. Yes, I was looking for
ward to Linner like everybody else,
but that's a given. And okay, I was al
so looking forward to the start of
Big/Little Week.
But actually, I was really excited
to go to the annual Big Row against
Cal at Redwood Shores.
Some people warned me that re
gattas aren't as fun as they seem, but
I was just super excited to cheer on
the teams that I had started coveiing
and finally see what it is that my
Mends spend so much time doing and
talking about. (I've come to leam that
basically all that rowers talk about is
rowing.)
I got up super early Saturday
morning and drove to Redwood
shores with my friend who was a
coxswain on the men's team last year
except that she was used to going
straight to the boat house (which is
not where you want to watch the
races from) so we barely made it
