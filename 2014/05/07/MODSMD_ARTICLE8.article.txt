# WEDNESDAY ROUNDTABLE
## Prognosticating draft surprises 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
With the NFL Draft set to kick
off tomorrow, many of Stanford's
key contributors from this past
season are waiting to hear their
nam-es called as they prepare to
move on to greener pastures in the
professional game. While ana
lysts and fans alike have been
preparing mock drafts for the past
few months, nothing is set in stone
until the picks come in on Draft
Day. That being said, we asked
football writers Michael Peterson,
Vihan Lakshman and David
Cohn to predict one surprise (good

or bad) awaiting any Stanford
player in this year's NFL Draft.
Michael: Despite an undrafted pro
jection by CBS Sports, Ben Gardner
will hear his name called, even before
the final round, during the NFL Draft.
Gardner's pro-day performance may
have been the best overall performance
by any Stanford player and I think that
at least one team will be intrigued
enough to select him in the fifth or sixth
round of the draft. After all, you only
need to impress one team enough in or
der to get drafted.
It shouldn't even be a surprise, real-


AVI BAGLA/The Stanford Daily
Despite missing the second half of the 2013 season with a torn pectoral,
fifth-year senior defensive end Ben Gardner (above) recovered in time for
Stanford's pro day and arguably had the team's best individual performance.
ly, but after Gardner tore his pec
toral against Oregon State, his draft
stock plummeted. His speedy recov
ery surprised many; at his pro day,
his vertical jump (39.5 inches) led all
Stanford participants and his broad
jump (10-foot-2) finished second,
even ahead of running back Anthony
Wilkerson. He has also been cutting
weight so that he can play as a line

backer if necessary.
The one trait teams know they're
getting if they draft Gardner is his
unquestionable work ethic: whether
he's a 3-4 defensive end, a 4-3 defen
sive end or a linebacker, Gardner
will work tirelessly to do what he's
told. His training to return in time
for pro day shows his potential to be
an ideal late-round prospect a
hard-worker with athletic upside.
Even though he's sometimes viewed
as a "tweener" with too little speed
to be an edge rusher, Gardner will
find a home in the fifth or sixth
round due to his tireless effort and
strong pro day performance.

Vihan: I really like the boldness
of Michael's pick, so in that spirit, I
am going to predict that Cameron
Fleming will be the first Stanford
player taken in the draft even
ahead of fellow offensive lineman
David Yankey, who garnered many
more accolades during his collegiate
career. Yankey's draft stock has
plummeted in recent weeks as more
teams fear that he lacks the athleti
cism of an NFL lineman. Moreover,
Fleming's tackle position is more
valued than Yankey's guard position
because of the premium NFL teams
place on the passing game over the
run game.
Fleming's 6-foot-6, 318-pound
frame makes him an attractive op
tion for many teams and he has
three years of experience starting
on one of the most dominant offen
sive lines in college football. Al
though Fleming has faced many of
the same criticisms as Yankey
namely slow foot-speed there
could be a team in need of an offen
sive tackle that pulls the trigger on
him as early as the second round.
Also, as Joey Beyda reminded us
in last week's roundtable, Fleming is
literally a rocket scientist and will
undoubtedly be one of the most in
telligent players in any locker room.
I could be wrong, but a Stanford de
gree in Aeronautics and Astronau
tics probably goes a long way in any
job application process.
David: I feel terrible for casting
this prediction, but I am concerned

that Shayne Skov will fall to the
third day of the draft rounds four
through seven. While I personally
feel that Skov should be far higher
on NFL Draft boards, the reality is
that many evaluations of him have
been surprisingly lukewarm.
In particular, these evaluations
have shockingly glossed over Skov's
tremendous production on the
Farm. In his five years at Stanford,
he totaled 354 tackles, good for sixth
in program history, while recording
a team-leading 109 tackles, 13.0
tackles for a loss, and three forced
fumbles in a consensus Ail-Ameri
can season last year.
However, instead of focusing on
what Skov has accomplished in his
football career, these evaluations
from NFL.com and other outlets
have pointed to his injury history,
particularly his lack of participation
in the NFL Combine due to a left
calf injury and his 2011 ACL and
MCL tears, as well as his DUI ar
rest in 2012, to question Skov's dura
bility and character.
Regarding his durability, I would
point out that Skov was able to pro
duce at an All-American level last
season, and he has played in 27 out
of 28 games since returning from his
knee injury in 2011. In turn, I be
lieve that Skov has a tremendous
heart and is a thoughtful individual
who will provide an immediate and
noticeable boost to any locker room
that he joins.
However, when NFL.com de
scribes Shayne as "not having re
turned to pre-injury form," I cannot
feel too confident about Shayne's
chances of being selected in the ear
ly rounds of the NFL Draft this
week.
