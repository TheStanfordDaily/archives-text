# WEDNESDAY ROUNDTABLE
## Prognosticating draft surprises 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
With the NFL Draft set to kick
off tomorrow, many of Stanford's
key contributors from this past
season are waiting to hear their
nam-es called as they prepare to
move on to greener pastures in the
professional game. While ana
lysts and fans alike have been
preparing mock drafts for the past
few months, nothing is set in stone
until the picks come in on Draft
Day. That being said, we asked
football writers Michael Peterson,
Vihan Lakshman and David
Cohn to predict one surprise (good

or bad) awaiting any Stanford
player in this year's NFL Draft.
Michael: Despite an undrafted pro
jection by CBS Sports, Ben Gardner
will hear his name called, even before
the final round, during the NFL Draft.
Gardner's pro-day performance may
have been the best overall performance
by any Stanford player and I think that
at least one team will be intrigued
enough to select him in the fifth or sixth
round of the draft. After all, you only
need to impress one team enough in or
der to get drafted.
It shouldn't even be a surprise, real-

Despite missing the second half of the 2013 season with a torn pectoral,
fifth-year senior defensive end Ben Gardner (above) recovered in time for
Stanford's pro day and arguably had the team's best individual performance.
