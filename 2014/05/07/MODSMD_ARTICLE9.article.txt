# BRONCO BEATDOWN
## CARD AVENGE 2013 HOME LOSS TO SANTA CLARA WITH ROUT 
### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
What a difference a year
makes.
Fifty-one weeks ago, Santa
Clara came into Sunken Dia
mond with a 0-21 record in its
West Coast Conference play,
yet still emerged with a
shutout victory over a listless
Stanford baseball team. The 3-
0 Broncos win was essentially
the final nail in the coffin of the
Cardinal's postseason hopes.

Tuesday night was a bit of a
different story, as Stanford
(22-20, 9-12 Pac-12) blew out
Santa Clara (22-26,12-9 WCC)
by an 8-2 score, spurred by a
five-run fourth inning that put
the game away early. The Car
dinal have now won 11 of their
last 15 games in their push for
the playoffs.
"It was good to keep up the
momentum that we had after
[the series win over UCLA],"
said junior Austin Slater. "Ob
viously, we haven't forgotten
what happened last year. And
we know that if we were to lose
another mid-week game, that
would be it for us. We're fight
ing for our lives right now, and
it's been fun there's been a
lot of energy from the guys
and we're just competing out
there."

On Sunday, freshman Brett
Hanewich was pushed back in
the rotation in favor of sopho
more Logan James, but Tues
day he got the start for the
Cardinal, his first since last
Monday against Cal. Over four
innings his longest outing
since April 11 despite being
limited by the coaching staff
Hanewich allowed just one
run on four hits and struck out
six. The Cardinal offense gave

him some support early on, as
the team jumped out to a 3-0
lead after two innings.
After getting on via a lead
off walk, freshman Tommy
Edman came across the plate
in the first on an error by the
Santa Clara shortstop on a ball
hit by senior Alex Blandino.
And in the second, junior Do
minic Jose had an RBI single
to knock in senior Brant Whit
ing, which was later followed
by another RBI single by Ed
man.
In the fourth, Stanford
broke the game open. Jose
walked to lead off the inning,
then junior Wayne Taylor
launched a two-run opposite
field homer over the left-cen
ter field fence (perhaps with a
bit of assistance from the
wind). Later in the inning,
Slater slapped a two-run sin
gle through the left side and
sophomore Zach Hoffpauir,
who went 2-for-3 in the game,
had a RBI single of his own.
Overall, the Cardinal scored
five runs on four hits, two
walks and a hit by pitch in the
fourth inning.
When Hanewich was re
moved from the game, the
Stanford bullpen closed the
game out, combining for five
innings of one-run ball with
contributions from sophomore
Marcus Brakeman, freshman
Chris Viall and junior Sam
Lindquist.
Over its last three games,
the Cardinal offense has ex
ploded: in addition to 31 total
hits, it has hit 10-for-25 (.400)
with runners in scoring posi
tion.
"In seeing some of the
games we've lost, we've had a
lot of hits, but we haven't got
ten the hits at the right time,"
said head coach Mark Mar
quess. "More importantly, a lot
of the games we lost, it was be
cause we left so many guys on

5/6, Sunken Diamond
base. That's the biggest dif
ference."
"Sometimes hitting is
just contagious," Slater
added. "When things are go
ing good, everyone is click
ing on all cylinders and
that's what it's been the last
couple of games."
Slater in particular has
been hot of late. Over a six

game hitting streak, he's hit
ting .545 (12-for-22) with
four extra-base hits and sev
en RBIs. He has improved
his average to a team-leading
.333 37 points higher than
the second-highest mark
and he's now leading the team
with 28 RBIs this season.
"I've just been more pa
tient up there, more selec
tive early in the count. Obvi
ously, confidence has a great
deal to do with it," he said.
"I'm just seeing the ball real
ly well right now and hope
fully I can keep it up for the

next three weeks."
The Cardinal are now an
undefeated 13-0 when scor
ing more than five runs and
will look to continue their of
fensive firepower down the
stretch with 11 games re
maining. Up next for Stan
ford is a weekend road trip
to the desert to take on an
Arizona team that has lost
eight of its last nine games.
The three-game series starts
Friday night at 7 p.m.
