## Thoughts from a former biker BIKE 
### Matt Lopez 
After two breathless years,
complete with screeching
brakes, a shattered chain and
many a windswept hairdo, my biking
career ended last year in glorious
tragedy. I had flown away to Wash
ington D.C. for the spring and left
my bike in front of FloMo with the
simple hope that it would remain
there until I returned to campus in
September. My faith was misplaced.
It is almost definitely the case
that the police cut the lock and took
it into their custody. I never got
around to looking for it in the im
pound lot, mostly because it was far
away and I didn't have a bike. To
that extent my tragedy was self-im
posed, but like a phoenix or a
Matthew McConaughey, I have
flourished anew. Not riding a bicycle
has shaken me from complacency
and forced me to see Stanford from
a new speed and a new perspective.
It has convinced me that if you can
walk, you should.
Let me get something out of the
way first: Stanford is a walkable
campus. It is a sprawling, confusing
behemoth, but one can walk from the
end of the Row to the Engineering
Quad and from FroSoCo to the GSB
in fifteen to twenty minutes. One can
walk anywhere, really, with time.
At first glance, time seems to be
the reason why every hour, blurs of
red and white zip through the Quad
and down Lasuen Mall in the last
few minutes before the clock hits the
:00 or the :15. Biking is quick it
conquers time, gulps up every
minute saved and spits them out as
units of productivity. On a biking
campus, a fifteen to twenty minute
commute is unfathomable. But this
feeling comes as a result of two mis
guided beliefs: that students don't
have that kind of time to spare, and
that the time they do have is so valu
able that it cannot and should not be
spent in transit.
I can't prove that Stanford stu
dents underestimate the quantity
and overestimate the worth of their
time, but I promise you, reader, that
if you allow yourself to walk, you will

realize a few things. First, slowing
down inevitably leads to thinking
deep thinking, the kind of thinking
that causes collisions with bollards.
That, I contend, should be the goal of
any education. Second, the prospect
of walking forces you to follow a
schedule that is freer, with more
time between Very Important
Things. What you lose in rabid pro
ductivity will reappear as relaxation
and self-care. Third, this campus is
absolutely beautiful, from the plaza
behind the Law School to the under
ground bathrooms. There are some
things that can't be noticed on
wheels.
I think that bike culture at Stan
ford is more than an issue of time
management, though. Biking is
what Stanford students do because
biking is what Stanford students do.
If that sounds unbelievable, think
about the ridiculous, utterly illogical
disuse of helmets on campus. When
I see people bike, I see them weave
between cars through intersections.
I see them with their arms crossed,
feet pedaling away, head turned up
wards to scorn the deities of mortal
ity. I know, you know, we all know
that wearing a helmet while biking is
the only sensible option. Yet what
keeps helmets gathering dust in
drawers is the overpowering sense
that wearing them just isn't what we
do here.
Biking is ingrained in the identi
ty of this university. The land is flat
and obstacle-free, and parking racks
line the side of nearly every building.
Smiling students on bikes populate
promotional brochures and website
banners. It's almost as if biking is in
evitable as if to thrive in this com
munity, one must ride a bike. But I
question it, and I hope you do too. I
hope you question the impulse to
ride a bike here, and that you think
so hard you walk into a bollard. I
hope you question what it means to
belong to a community, and what it
means to be an individual within that
community.
I didn't have a bike fresh
man year, but by sophomore
year I was zipping down
Mayfield Avenue, practicing

riding with only one hand.
And that's true for nearly
everyone here on campus.
Asking questions can be ex
hausting. But sometimes
when I walk, those questions
enter my mind and I have the
time to consider them. The
answers haven't come, not all
of them, not yet. But after

four years here, one answer
has come to me in the form of
a loss. I don't need my bike. I
am free.
