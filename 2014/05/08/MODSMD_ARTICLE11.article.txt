## Divesting from coal: good intention, bad decision 
### Karim Farhat Scott McNally 
Two days ago, Stanford's Board
of Trustees (BoT) decided
that Stanford University will
not make direct investments of en
dowment funds in publicly traded
companies whose principal business
is the mining of coal for use in ener
gy generation. Praising this effort,
President Hennessy stated that
"moving away from coal in the in
vestment context is a small but con
structive step while work continues
at Stanford and elsewhere to devel
op broadly viable sustainable ener
gy solutions for the future." Simply
put, our University has declared
that coal is bad, and we should aban
don it. As two Stanford researchers
whose work focuses on reducing
carbon emissions from energy sys
tems, we believe that Stanford's
BoT divestment from coal was a bad
decision, rushed and misguided, and
we care to share with you why.
Before we begin, we must em
phasize two key points. First, we be
lieve climate change is real and hap
pening, and we have an undeniable
responsibility to fight it. Second, we
believe that reducing carbon diox
ide (CO2) emissions is crucial to mit
igate climate change impacts. That
said, we also believe that divest
ment from coal or fossil fuels in
general is not the right answer,
and when compared to other op
tions to reduce climate impacts, di
vesting from coal mines is clearly
not the best solution. As a globally
renowned university, Stanford has
three big shoes to fill: as an investor,
an educator and a research insti
tute. Because Stanford does not
have any formal legislative or regu
latory authority, we will focus on
what Stanford can actually do, or
let's say, could have done.

It's the Emissions, not the Fossil-
Fuels
As a basic scientific fact, we first
note that the cause of our climate
problems is the emissions, not the
fossil fuels. Coal, oil and natural
gas are useful forms of energy, but
the CO2 emissions that result from
burning them is what contributes to
climate change. Thus, in simple
terms, Stanford's green war should
focus on the emissions, not on the
fuels. Accordingly, if Stanford is re
ally keen on "divesting from some
thing," the actions that we should
take, in order of effectiveness, are
as follows: Divest from emissions,
divest from burning the fuel and

lastly, divest from producing the
fuel. The BoT chose the least effec
tive of the three.
The main question becomes:
How would we divest from emis
sions or burning the fuel, rather
than from producing the fuel?

Divest from Emissions: Invest in
Clean Energy
The recipe here is simple: Keep
the investments the way they are,
and use the returns from those in
vestments to fund clean energy. Fo
cusing on coal: The majority of coal
emissions do not come from the
mines, but rather from the smoke
stacks of the combustion sources.
So how do we reduce those emis
sions? We capture them! Carbon
Capture and Storage (CCS) is a
technology that has been studied,
tested, and deployed worldwide for
years for similar applications.
There's even a class that teaches
CCS right here at Stanford! (EN
ERGY 253, if you are interested).
Instead of divesting from coal and
closing mines, why doesn't Stanford
invest in new CCS companies?
Another example, which is
rather obvious: rooftop solar. After
reading this article, take a trip to
Hoover Tower and have a look at
how many empty roofs on campus
can be retrofitted with solar panels.
Instead of putting miners out of
work, why doesn't Stanford create
more jobs by increasing investment
in solar energy?
Frankly, we argue, isn't it easier
and more reasonable to focus our in
vestment efforts on reducing emis
sions on campus first before target
ing the coal mines? Also, speaking of
efforts on campus, the light by
which you are now reading this arti
cle (unless you are outside) is prob
ably powered by electricity gener
ated from natural gas, the fossil fuel

that Stanford decided to use to
power the campus for years to come
through the SESI project. We find it
curious that the University chose to
divest from "off-campus coal" but
not "on-campus natural gas," and
we wonder if this half-baked ap
proach is due to political or financial
considerations that are only tangen
tially relevant to the mission of ad
dressing climate change.

Divest from Fossil-Fuel Burning:
Why not utilities?
The miners suffer a serious dis
advantage: they either mine coal, or
they go home. They simply have no
other option to avoid unemployment
if their mines shut down. However,
for power plants (think utilities),
which are the actual sources of
emissions, the options are numer
ous. Stanford could make a condi
tional yet credible threat of divest
ment from utilities: "Reduce your
emissions or we pull our funding." If
the utilities want to continue using
cheap coal, they will have to invest
in CCS (adding more jobs!); other
wise, they can be creative in finding
solutions like fuel mixing, peak
shaving, demand-side manage
ment, efficiency improvements or a
whole host of other options, all while
re-allocating their human capital
and thus reducing job losses. So
why didn't Stanford decide to divest
from utilities?

Divest from Fossil-Fuel Pro
duction: Why not. Oil and/or
Natural Gas?

We wonder why Stanford chose
to divest from coal, but not petrole
um. If coal is "abandoned" because
it results in carbon emissions, why
are oil and natural gas "spared"?
Presumably we have fossil fuel in
vestments because they are prof
itable. Reiterating the first point,
rather than blacklisting fossil fuels,
why not use their investment rev
enues to fund research on emissions
reduction and renewable energy?
Finally, we conclude with a few
words on the implications this deci
sion might have on Stanford's image
as a leading educational institute.
By declaring coal a bad fuel not wor
thy of investment, what message
are we communicating to the world?
To scholars, are we declaring CCS
research dead? Nationally, are we
telling states like Indiana and

We wonder why
Stanford chose to
divest from coal,
but not petroleum.
Wyoming that we believe
they should not power their
hospitals because the majori
ty of that power comes from
burning coal? International
ly, are we telling China and
India that we don't support
their efforts to extend elec
tricity to hundreds of mil
lions of underprivileged citi
zens because it comes from
coal?
We, in Silicon Valley, are
privileged to be living in a de
veloped community that can
for the most part sup
port switching away from
coal. However, outside our

"Silicon Valley bubble," the
world is different. We really
fear this decision might dis
tort Stanford's image as a
beacon of impartial energy
innovation. Rather than ad
vocating for an inclusive con
versation and a comprehen
sive portfolio of solutions to
clean our energy system, this
decision picks winners and
losers and might dispropor
tionately harm disadvan
taged populations.
We are sure that the Stan
ford Board of Trustees cares
deeply about climate change,
and as Stanford energy
scholars, we are committed
to addressing this global
problem by exploring new
pathways to clean energy so
lutions. In our opinion, how
ever, there is a long list of op

tions to address climate
change, and divestment from
coal mining is at the bottom
of this list.
