# Bridgewater the best QB in this year's NFL Draft
## 
### Do-Hyoung Park 
Another year, another
NFL Draft and another
talented class of college
football stars ready to
prove themselves at the
next level of play My colleague Joey
Beyda tells me that he'll be devoting
his column tomorrow to the legacy
some of the Stanford athletes in this
year's draft, so I'll be taking a bigger
picture view in my predictions tonight.
There's been a lot of uncertainty in
this year's draft in that the stocks of a
lot of people have been rising and
falling significantly Stanford fans will
of course be familiar with how Shayne
Skov has been dropping down the
charts over the last few weeks, but
seemingly nobody has dropped from
grace to the extent that Louisville
quarterback Teddy Bridgewater has
over the last several months.
Once lauded as a consensus first
overall pick in this year's draft and the
most well-rounded quarterback in a
class loaded with good-but-not-great
prospects, Bridgewater has slowly
tumbled down the ranks to the lowfirst
round, and even the second round, in
some cases. Sure, Bridgewater didn't
have a fantastic pro day, and sure, he
may have small hands, but the fact re
mains that all of those elements don't
affect how he will pan out as an NFL
quarterback any more than they would
have a few months ago when those ele
ments hadn't been added to the pic
ture.

In fact, I'm going to go ahead and
say that Teddy Bridgewater should be
the first quarterback off the board.
Judging by recent developments,
that's not going to happen, but I don't
think that either Blake Bortles or
Johnny Manziel offer as much immedi
ate upside for teams wanting at the
quarterback position as Bridgewater
does.
I'm not saying that Bridgewater
should return to his spot atop the draft
board, because it will be a travesty if
Jadeveon Clowney, the best pure ath
lete that the NFL Draft has seen in a
long time, doesn't get picked there
(barring, of course, a trade of picks be
tween teams). Clowney is truly a freak
of nature—when do you see 6-foot-5,
266-pound defensive ends running a
4.5 in the 40 and there aren't any su
perstar quarterbacks in this year's
class.
But the idea that Blake Bortles
a quarterback that literally nobody
outside of Central Florida knew about
before this year's Fiesta Bowl me
teorically shot up the boards over the
last two months and is being realistical
ly looked at as the first quarterback off
the board is ridiculous. If he hadn't had
enough of an impact during the regular
season to get on everybody's boards at
that point (like Derek Carr of Fresno
State did), there's nothing that's
changed from then to now in his per
formance and experience that would
warrant such an enormous rise up the
boards.
It's literally just because the "ex
perts" and analysts need new story
lines and fresh faces to keep viewers
and readers interested through the ex
tensive coverage of the NFL Draft
that Bortles (and others, like Eastern
Illinois quarterback Jimmy Garoppo
lo) has broken out to the extent that he
has, at the cost of others like Bridgewa
ter.
While I'm firmly sold on Bridgewa
ter as the top quarterback pick, I
wouldn't be as disappointed to see
Johnny Manziel go first overall. I think
that he has the most room for develop
ment of superstar talent out of the
quarterbacks in this year's class, some
thing that might be attractive for
teams looking to draft a franchise
quarterback who wouldn't necessarily
make as big of an immediate impact on
the field. Manziel would immediately
bring his dynamism and million-dollar
attitude to the field day in and day out,
something from which a stagnant fran
chise like Cleveland could benefit. That
said, I think that a lot of that woiJd also
be provided by Bridgewater—with
more immediate results.
A lot of the dynamic success that
Manziel saw was in the face of more lax
secondary coverage and pass rushers
that didn't possess NFL speed or
strength leading to more busted
coverages that Manziel could take ad
vantage of, and more leeway on scram
bles and broken tackles when he was
forced to leave the pocket. But at the
next level, where everybody was on top
of the collegiate game at some point, a
lot of the opportunities that Manziel
was able to exploit in his trademark dy
namic manner won't be there. And it
will take time to adjust.
Meanwhile, whatever team takes
Bridgewater at whatever too-low pick
he drops to will be very happy indeed
at the immediate production that it'll
be getting.

4.5 in the 40 and there aren't any su
perstar quarterbacks in this year's
class.
But the idea that Blake Bortles
a quarterback that literally nobody
outside of Central Florida knew about
before this year's Fiesta Bowl me
teorically shot up the boards over the
last two months and is being realistical
ly looked at as the first quarterback off
the board is ridiculous. If he hadn't had
enough of an impact during the regular
season to get on everybody's boards at
that point (like Derek Carr of Fresno
State did), there's nothing that's
changed from then to now in his per
formance and experience that would
warrant such an enormous rise up the
boards.
It's literally just because the "ex
perts" and analysts need new story
lines and fresh faces to keep viewers
and readers interested through the ex
tensive coverage of the NFL Draft
that Bortles (and others, like Eastern
Illinois quarterback Jimmy Garoppo
lo) has broken out to the extent that he
has, at the cost of others like Bridgewa
ter.
While I'm firmly sold on Bridgewa
ter as the top quarterback pick, I
wouldn't be as disappointed to see
Johnny Manziel go first overall. I think
that he has the most room for develop
ment of superstar talent out of the
quarterbacks in this year's class, some
thing that might be attractive for
teams looking to draft a franchise
quarterback who wouldn't necessarily
make as big of an immediate impact on
the field. Manziel would immediately
bring his dynamism and million-dollar
attitude to the field day in and day out,
something from which a stagnant fran
chise like Cleveland could benefit. That
said, I think that a lot of that woiJd also
be provided by Bridgewater—with
more immediate results.
A lot of the dynamic success that
Manziel saw was in the face of more lax
secondary coverage and pass rushers
that didn't possess NFL speed or
strength leading to more busted
coverages that Manziel could take ad
vantage of, and more leeway on scram
bles and broken tackles when he was
forced to leave the pocket. But at the
next level, where everybody was on top
of the collegiate game at some point, a
lot of the opportunities that Manziel
was able to exploit in his trademark dy
namic manner won't be there. And it
will take time to adjust.
Meanwhile, whatever team takes
Bridgewater at whatever too-low pick
he drops to will be very happy indeed
at the immediate production that it'll
be getting.

Another year, another
NFL Draft and another
talented class of college
football stars ready to
prove themselves at the
next level of play My colleague Joey
Beyda tells me that he'll be devoting
his column tomorrow to the legacy
some of the Stanford athletes in this
year's draft, so I'll be taking a bigger
picture view in my predictions tonight.
There's been a lot of uncertainty in
this year's draft in that the stocks of a
lot of people have been rising and
falling significantly Stanford fans will
of course be familiar with how Shayne
Skov has been dropping down the
charts over the last few weeks, but
seemingly nobody has dropped from
grace to the extent that Louisville
quarterback Teddy Bridgewater has
over the last several months.
Once lauded as a consensus first
overall pick in this year's draft and the
most well-rounded quarterback in a
class loaded with good-but-not-great
prospects, Bridgewater has slowly
tumbled down the ranks to the lowfirst
round, and even the second round, in
some cases. Sure, Bridgewater didn't
have a fantastic pro day, and sure, he
may have small hands, but the fact re
mains that all of those elements don't
affect how he will pan out as an NFL
quarterback any more than they would
have a few months ago when those ele
ments hadn't been added to the pic
ture.

In fact, I'm going to go ahead and
say that Teddy Bridgewater should be
the first quarterback off the board.
Judging by recent developments,
that's not going to happen, but I don't
think that either Blake Bortles or
Johnny Manziel offer as much immedi
ate upside for teams wanting at the
quarterback position as Bridgewater
does.
I'm not saying that Bridgewater
should return to his spot atop the draft
board, because it will be a travesty if
Jadeveon Clowney, the best pure ath
lete that the NFL Draft has seen in a
long time, doesn't get picked there
(barring, of course, a trade of picks be
tween teams). Clowney is truly a freak
of nature—when do you see 6-foot-5,
266-pound defensive ends running a
4.5 in the 40 and there aren't any su
perstar quarterbacks in this year's
class.
