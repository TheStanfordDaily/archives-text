## Cardinal battle bad seed, distant regional location 
### CAMERON MILER DESK EDITOR 
Coming off the program's biggest win in recent
memory, the No. 4 Stanford women's golf team will
look to avoid a letdown and continue its champi
onship-level play at this weekend's NCAA East
Regional. Despite winning the ultra-competitive
Pac-12 Tournament an event that featured six
of the country's top 10 squads the Cardinal re
ceived the No. 3 seed in the East Regional, which
will be played on the Southwood Golf Course in
Tallahassee, Florida.
While Anne Walker's unit is certainly happy
about advancing to the NCAA preliminary round,
its seeding and regional placement were some
what of a head-scratcher. The No. 3 slot, which in
dicates that the NCAA committee ranked Stan
ford as the ninth best team in the country, seem
ingly discounts the Card's truly historic victory on
at Trysting Tree a few weeks ago. It also does not
align with Golf Week's collegiate rankings, which
pegs the Cardinal as No. 4 in the nation.
In addition, Stanford is one of only two Pacif
ic time zone squads in the 24-team field, mean
ing it will likely have a full day of travel before
the wheels touch down in Florida. But despite
the seemingly raw deal it received in its regional
assignment, the group seems to have put all dis
tractions out of sight in their march towards a na
tional title.
"We weren't thrilled with our draw in the East
Region," Walker said. "Getting to Tallahassee in
volves a lot of travel and obviously a quick time ad
justment, especially given our early tee times for
day one and day two. The other big factor at play
is the Bermuda grass that we will face. It calls for
a different kind of shot and strategy, one that we
don't have the opportunity to practice. With that
being said, however, I know we will quickly adjust
and make good decisions come game time.
"No matter what region you go to, you have to
play well, and that will be our focus," she added.
After placing fifth in the West Regional last
season on their home course, the Cardinal are

aiming to be even more competitive at this sea
son's regional event. But it will be a tough test in
Tallahassee, with Stanford facing a field that
counts five top-15 teams, including No. 3 and
reigning ACC champion Duke. The two have
faced each other three times in tournament play
this season, with the Blue Devils beating the Car
dinal all three times by a combined 65 strokes.
Duke, which has to be considered the favorite in
the field, will be led by Celine Boutier and Laeti
tia Beck, both of whom are ranked amongst the
world's top 30 female amateurs.
No. 9 South Carolina, which received the re
gional's second seed, enters with an at-large bid
from the SEC, a conference that was won by No.
13 Yanderbilt. The Commodores are the fourth
seed in the East Regional, with No. 10 Pepperdine
the champions of the West Coast Conference
rounding out the top five teams in Tallahassee.
Eight squads, plus two individuals, will advance to
the NCAA Championships from each of the three
regionals, meaning that if Stanford plays even
close to its best, the quintet won't have a difficult
time moving on to Tulsa.
"We have a great opportunity to qualify for the
finals," Walker remarked. "We have a strong
team from one to five with senior leadership,
steady players and also players who can go low.
That always makes for a competitive team."
Walker will return three out of her five players
from the 2013 regional team, with Sally Watson
graduated and current senior Danielle Frasier not
likely to play. Those two will likely be replaced by
freshman Casey Danielson and senior Marissa
Mar. Danielson's improving play during the spring
season has been a godsend for the Card, which
needed a potent third scorer behind sophomores
Mariah Stackhouse and Lauren Kim after Mariko
Tumangan began to struggle.
Nevertheless, Tumangan was the only Stan
ford golfer to finish in the individual top 10 at last
season's regional event, with Stackhouse and Kim
also placing in the top 20. But Watson was the next
Cardinal player at T-65, which showed a lack of
depth that didn't allow the unit to be very compet
itive at the NCAA Championships. Stanford is al
ready well on the way to addressing that issue, ev
idenced by the fact that four of its five players fin
ished in the top 13 at the Pac-12 tourney. If the unit
can replicate that performance at the regional

event and beyond, it will have an excellent chance
of bringing home hardware.
"We know our stats show that when we get the
rball up-and-down 55 percent of the time, we can
compete with any team in the country," Walker
said. "That goes for every individual too: Every
player in our lineup can score when they play with
a level head and make good decisions."
Play at the 72-hole NCAA East Regional will
begin today, with the event wrapping up on Satur
day. If the Cardinal or one of their individuals ad
vances, there will be ten days off before the N CAA
Championships in Ihlsa, Oklahoma.

Sophomore Lauren Kim (above) has helped
the Card put together one of their best seasons
in recent memory. Stanford now aims to cap
the campaign with a strong showing at NCAAs.
Coming off the program's biggest win in recent
memory, the No. 4 Stanford women's golf team will
look to avoid a letdown and continue its champi
onship-level play at this weekend's NCAA East
Regional. Despite winning the ultra-competitive
Pac-12 Tournament an event that featured six
of the country's top 10 squads the Cardinal re
ceived the No. 3 seed in the East Regional, which
will be played on the Southwood Golf Course in
Tallahassee, Florida.
While Anne Walker's unit is certainly happy
about advancing to the NCAA preliminary round,
its seeding and regional placement were some
what of a head-scratcher. The No. 3 slot, which in
dicates that the NCAA committee ranked Stan
ford as the ninth best team in the country, seem
ingly discounts the Card's truly historic victory on
at Trysting Tree a few weeks ago. It also does not
align with Golf Week's collegiate rankings, which
pegs the Cardinal as No. 4 in the nation.
In addition, Stanford is one of only two Pacif
ic time zone squads in the 24-team field, mean
ing it will likely have a full day of travel before
the wheels touch down in Florida. But despite
the seemingly raw deal it received in its regional
assignment, the group seems to have put all dis
tractions out of sight in their march towards a na
tional title.
"We weren't thrilled with our draw in the East
Region," Walker said. "Getting to Tallahassee in
volves a lot of travel and obviously a quick time ad
justment, especially given our early tee times for
day one and day two. The other big factor at play
is the Bermuda grass that we will face. It calls for
a different kind of shot and strategy, one that we
don't have the opportunity to practice. With that
being said, however, I know we will quickly adjust
and make good decisions come game time.
"No matter what region you go to, you have to
play well, and that will be our focus," she added.
After placing fifth in the West Regional last
season on their home course, the Cardinal are

aiming to be even more competitive at this sea
son's regional event. But it will be a tough test in
Tallahassee, with Stanford facing a field that
counts five top-15 teams, including No. 3 and
reigning ACC champion Duke. The two have
faced each other three times in tournament play
this season, with the Blue Devils beating the Car
dinal all three times by a combined 65 strokes.
Duke, which has to be considered the favorite in
the field, will be led by Celine Boutier and Laeti
tia Beck, both of whom are ranked amongst the
world's top 30 female amateurs.
No. 9 South Carolina, which received the re
gional's second seed, enters with an at-large bid
from the SEC, a conference that was won by No.
13 Yanderbilt. The Commodores are the fourth
seed in the East Regional, with No. 10 Pepperdine
the champions of the West Coast Conference
rounding out the top five teams in Tallahassee.
Eight squads, plus two individuals, will advance to
the NCAA Championships from each of the three
regionals, meaning that if Stanford plays even
close to its best, the quintet won't have a difficult
time moving on to Tulsa.
"We have a great opportunity to qualify for the
finals," Walker remarked. "We have a strong
team from one to five with senior leadership,
steady players and also players who can go low.
That always makes for a competitive team."
Walker will return three out of her five players
from the 2013 regional team, with Sally Watson
graduated and current senior Danielle Frasier not
likely to play. Those two will likely be replaced by
freshman Casey Danielson and senior Marissa
Mar. Danielson's improving play during the spring
season has been a godsend for the Card, which
needed a potent third scorer behind sophomores
Mariah Stackhouse and Lauren Kim after Mariko
Tumangan began to struggle.
Nevertheless, Tumangan was the only Stan
ford golfer to finish in the individual top 10 at last
season's regional event, with Stackhouse and Kim
also placing in the top 20. But Watson was the next
Cardinal player at T-65, which showed a lack of
depth that didn't allow the unit to be very compet
itive at the NCAA Championships. Stanford is al
ready well on the way to addressing that issue, ev
idenced by the fact that four of its five players fin
ished in the top 13 at the Pac-12 tourney. If the unit
can replicate that performance at the regional

event and beyond, it will have an excellent chance
of bringing home hardware.
"We know our stats show that when we get the
rball up-and-down 55 percent of the time, we can
compete with any team in the country," Walker
said. "That goes for every individual too: Every
player in our lineup can score when they play with
a level head and make good decisions."
