# CARD AIM FOR REPEAT RUN
## 
### KRISHNA BASSI 
The Stanford women's lacrosse
team will make its fifth appearance in
the NCAA Tournament when it plays
No. 9 Duke on Friday at 1 p.m. in a
first round game at Notre Dame, In
diana.
Both teams received at-large spots
in the tournament; the No. 19 Cardi
nal (14-4) were second in the MPSF
regular season and tournament, while
Duke (9-7) was fourth in the dominat
ing ACC and lost to Virginia in the
first round of its tourney.
This is Stanford's second consecu
tive appearance in the NCAA Tourna
ment. This season, the Cardinal re
turned 11 starters and 96 percent of
their goals from last year's team,
which advanced to the second round of
the NCAA Tournament for the first
time in school history. That experi
ence paid dividends, as Stanford went
4-1 against teams who have appeared
in the top 20 at some point this season,
including an 11-10 victory at then-No.
6 Notre Dame. The Cardinal finished
their regular season in second place in
the MPSF with a 7-2 conference
record, but fell to Denver 14-11 in the
MPSF Tournament final.
Stanford junior midfielder Han
nah Farr clinched the MPSF Player of
the Year award with her great goal
scoring, athleticism and overall ag
gressive play on both offense and de
fense. Farr has 31 goals, 11 assists, 32
ground balls and a team-high 40 draw
controls.
With Farr leading the way, Stan
ford also has an incredibly balanced
scoring team, with seven players with
20 or more goals. Senior attacker
Rachel Ozer, who has 32 goals, 13 as
sists and 24 ground balls, will be a key

player for the Cardinal in the attack.
Ozer possesses the experience and
leadership qualities that the team will
need in the tournament.
Other key players for the Cardi
nal's offensive charge will be sopho
more midfielder Lucy Dikeou and
freshman attacker Kelsey Murray.
Dikeou has scored 21 of her 31 goals
over the last seven games, adding to
the depth of the Cardinal attack. Also,
keep an eye on freshman attacker
Kelsey Murray, who has 25 goals and a
team-best 16 assists.
The defense for Stanford will rely
on the leadership of a pair of seniors,
defender Megan Lerner and goalie
Lyndsey Munoz. Lerner has 32
ground balls and 38 draw controls this
season, and alongside Munoz, who
has 30 ground balls and 85 saves, she
anchors the Cardinal's defensive ef
forts.
Six Stanford players were award
ed with a spot on the All-MPSF team,
with Ozer, Dikeou, Farr, Anderson
and Lerner all named the first team.
Duke has a postseason chip on its
shoulder, as it has made it to six
NCAA semifinals but never advanced
to a final. The Blue Devils have de
feated the Cardinal all six times the
two teams have met, though none of
the current players have faced each
other. A pair of All-ACC first-teamers
in junior midfielder Taylor Trimble
and senior defender Taylor Virden
will look to extend that streak.
Waiting in the second round for
Friday's victor is either High Point or
host Notre Dame.
Stanford will begin its NCAA
Tournament quest Friday at 1 p.m.
