## Windhover approaches completion Center will act as a place for reflection and escape from stress 
### VICTOR XU STAFF WRITER 
The construction of the Windhover
Contemplative Center, a spiritual refuge
that aims to allow visitors to escape from
the daily intensity of campus life, will be
finished early this summer, according to
University administrators.
Although the official dedication of the
building will take place on Oct. 8, the fa
cility will be made available for use dur
ing summer quarter. The center, which is
situated on Santa Teresa Street and
named after the "Windhover" series of
paintings by the late Stanford professor
and artist Nathan Oliveira, will be open
to SUID holders between 11 a.m. to 11
p.m.
According to Greg Boardman, vice
provost for student affairs, the concept
of having a location specifically dedicat
ed to self-reflection and de-stressing was
formulated in response to increasing
student stress. As such, the building fea
tures Oliveira's original paintings, com
fortable seating, an outdoor reflecting
pool, a granite labyrinth for meditative
strolling and a Japanese-style garden
with a fountain and tree.
Boardman also emphasized that the
center is intended to be calming and
technology-free. The structure's
'rammed earth' walls and thick glass
windows will block cellular and Internet
signals, and students are expected to re
move their shoes before entering the
building. Outside of the center's regular
hours, there are plans for docent tours
that will draw attention to the Oliveira
paintings and the building's unique ar
chitecture.
"We hope [the center] will be a refuge
from Stanford, daily stressings and life
in general," Boardman said.
According to Joshua Aidlin, one of
the center's chief designers, almost
every aspect of the Windhover center
was purposefully built toward the build
ing's goal and is "episodically designed."
There are hidden courtyards and spaces
that are not immediately visible, forcing
visitors to independently discover each
feature of the 4,000 square-foot center.
The entryway is also intentionally
drawn-out, requiring navigation
through tree and bamboo groves to
reach the entrance.
"The intent, again, is to shed the
stresses of the day potentially even prior
to entering the building," Aidlin said.
