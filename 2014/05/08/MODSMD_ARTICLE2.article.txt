## Windhover approaches completion Center will act as a place for reflection and escape from stress 
### VICTOR XU STAFF WRITER 
The construction of the Windhover
Contemplative Center, a spiritual refuge
that aims to allow visitors to escape from
the daily intensity of campus life, will be
finished early this summer, according to
University administrators.
Although the official dedication of the
building will take place on Oct. 8, the fa
cility will be made available for use dur
ing summer quarter. The center, which is
situated on Santa Teresa Street and
named after the "Windhover" series of
paintings by the late Stanford professor
and artist Nathan Oliveira, will be open
to SUID holders between 11 a.m. to 11
p.m.
According to Greg Boardman, vice
provost for student affairs, the concept
of having a location specifically dedicat
ed to self-reflection and de-stressing was
formulated in response to increasing
student stress. As such, the building fea
tures Oliveira's original paintings, com
fortable seating, an outdoor reflecting
pool, a granite labyrinth for meditative
strolling and a Japanese-style garden
with a fountain and tree.
Boardman also emphasized that the
center is intended to be calming and
technology-free. The structure's
'rammed earth' walls and thick glass
windows will block cellular and Internet
signals, and students are expected to re
move their shoes before entering the
building. Outside of the center's regular
hours, there are plans for docent tours
that will draw attention to the Oliveira
paintings and the building's unique ar
chitecture.
"We hope [the center] will be a refuge
from Stanford, daily stressings and life
in general," Boardman said.
According to Joshua Aidlin, one of
the center's chief designers, almost
every aspect of the Windhover center
was purposefully built toward the build
ing's goal and is "episodically designed."
There are hidden courtyards and spaces
that are not immediately visible, forcing
visitors to independently discover each
feature of the 4,000 square-foot center.
The entryway is also intentionally
drawn-out, requiring navigation
through tree and bamboo groves to
reach the entrance.
"The intent, again, is to shed the
stresses of the day potentially even prior
to entering the building," Aidlin said.
The location a busy intersection in
close proximity to many dormitories and
academic buildingsâ€”was also cho
sen in order to make visits to the cen
ter convenient and frequent.
According to Scotty McLennan,
dean for religious life, the Windhover
Center satisfies a niche on campus
that has until now been unfulfilled.
While reflection and meditation have
been possible at facilities like Memo
rial Church, the Center for Inter-Re
ligious Community, Learning, and
Experiences (CIRCLE) and the
Cantor Arts Center, there has never
been an area specifically designated
for relieving pressure and stress
from students' daily lives.
"What I felt we were not really
serving well was the students who
say 'l'm spiritual but not religious' or
say '[l'm] not spiritual at all, but I do
understand the importance of well
ness for de-stressing and so on,"
McLennan, who has been involved
with the Windhover project since
2002, said.
McLennan, who has worked on
the Windhover proj ect for 12 years of
his 14-year tenure as dean of reli

gious life, expressed relief at seeing
the opening of the contemplative
space during his final few months at
Stanford.
'As of August 31, I'm done, so I
see this as sort of a culminating activ
ity for me," he said.
Although the Windhover building
will soon be the newest addition to
campus, the idea for the project has
been floating around for almost two
decades. According to Suzanne
Duca, the primary donor for the
project, she became enamored with
the idea of the center after attending
one of Oliveira's showings of the
"Windhover" series in 1995. Oliveira
expressed his hope that the paintings
might remain together and someday
form the focus of a meditative space.
The Board of Trustees approved the
project in 2012, and construction
began in June 2013.
"Two years ago, Nate and I met
for the last time at the brand new site
designated for Windhover, just ten
days before he passed away," she
said. "He thought it was perfect."
