# Paper Void finds new space
## Stanford student band will open Frost Music Festival on May 19 
### IRENE HSU | DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
The story of Paper Void's cre
ation began in the summer of 2013
when guitarist Gavin Leeper 'l3
M.S. 'l4 completed the Jazz Guitar
Intensive at the Jazz School at
Berkeley. On the second mile of his
meditative run, he was thinking
about music he loved Zero 7's
album, "Simple Things," for in
stance — when it occurred to him
that this was the type of music he
could be making with others.
The same day, he began to con
tact musicians for an eight-piece
band. A few days later, he met with
lead singer, JP Wright 'l2, former
front man of an up-tempo band, The
Irregulars, to discuss the logistics of
running a band. By the end of Sep
tember, the band had had its first re
hearsal.
From the start, the project was
ambitious "The Downtempo
Band Vision," Leeper's initial band
write-up, projected for the band's
first gig to be in fall quarter.
"I'm just saying, I want this
project to go places and go there
quickly," he wrote.
By week six, Leeper, who had al
ready been in contact with the Com
munity Managers of several co-ops
through previous DJ-ing gigs, se
cured a slot at Kairos' Wine and
Cheese on Wednesdays. After

wards, Paper Void continued to per
form through the year at Snowchel
la, the Enchanted Broccoli Forest
and Maggie McGarry's in San
Francisco.
The band performed at Beltane
last Saturday and will be opening at
Frost on May 17. Come the end of
June, Paper Void will finally be re
leasing their extended play of five
songs.
One of the few points of indeci
sion the band has faced is the band
name. Previously named "The
Downtempo Project" and "Shola,"
the band finally decided on "Paper
Void."
While the band's sound still re
flects downtempo music, a genre
from the '9os that knead together
electronic music, funk, jazz and hip
hop, the band wanted to use the
band name to emphasize a juxtapo
sition.
Although the music is downtem
po, Leeper said, "We play it at high
energy and there's this contrast,
similar to the name paper is this
thin material while void is infinite
and amorphous."
There is also a second meaning
to the name. Leeper was inspired by
his experience abroad in Japan in
spring 2012. In Japanese, ma is a
character that roughly means

"space," such as in calligraphy,
where shaping the white space of a
page is just as important as focusing
on the brush strokes; or "pause,"
such as in music.
Ma is particularly important for
an eight-piece band. While the band
members also including bassist
Evan Gitterman 'l4, keyboardist
Jeremy Schreier 'l4 and drummer
Alex Favaro 'l2 have since be
come closer through the medium of
music, they were initially just ac
quaintances, both musically and so
cially.
For jazz-style music especially,
this set-up could potentially be
problematic.
"When you're improvising in
jazz, you're supporting each other
through music," Schreier said. "The
more you play with each other, the
more familiar you are with each oth
ers' styles. Being friends outside of
music can add more depth to the
music it's an extra level of trust."
And yet, as the band recently
proved at Beltane, they had "re
fined the ma," Leeper said. In
songs such as then* cover of Submo
tion Orchestra's "All Night," the
synchronization is tangible when
the music suspends for just a mo
ment before blooming in the
warm spring ah* again.

A week ago, Leeper drove me
and my editor to Paper Void's bi
weekly rehearsal.
"Oh yeah, new development," he
said. "One of our singers can't make
it to Beltane."
Beltane is Synergy's annual
pagan festival that took place this
past Saturday. The guest singer was
a devout Christian.
"Wow," I said.
"It's okay" he said. "We'll make
it work."
He maneuvered his Audi onto
the pathway bordering the Band
Shack.
"Are you allowed to park here?"
I asked.
"Yeah," he said, lining his car up
with the building. A cluster of brass
instrumentalists from the Stanford
Marching Band looks up from prac
tice.
"Well, it's actually a loading
zone," he clarifies. "Some guy
comes in and yells at us sometimes
but it's okay."
Leeper wears his hair long, his
flannels tartan, his jeans rolled. His
attitude is best described as zen.
"I try to live on purpose," he said
when asked about his life philoso
phy. Did he mean "with purpose"?

Paper Void has seen their profile rise after starting off as a humble campus band. The group, whose music is described as Downtempo - mixing
electronic music, funk, jazz and hip-hop will open the Frost Music Festival. The eight members include a freshman and an alumni.
"On purpose like intentionally."
Apart from having studied medi
tation in Japan, he also meditates
through running "No music," he
said. "I count my breaths. It returns
me to my center."
Apparently, he meditates during
practice. The band members are
running through their set for
Beltane; versions of "That sounded
good," and "What if we did this?" are
tossed around.
"Yeah, yeah, I like that" Gavin
says at one point, and while his gui
tar is still slung across his body, he
casually reaches up, then out, into a
perfectly balanced yoga tree pose.
Leeper's taste in music is colored
with elements of this philosophy
he calls it "mindful music," and it is
complex while centered on a simple
yet profound idea, something he
mulls over and turns around in his
head. When he traveled over two
hours from Kyoto to Tokyo to see the
concert of one of his favorite bands,
Cinematic Orchestra, Leeper found
his mind wandering and instantly
felt guilty.
"I went through a lot to get to the

show, and I felt I needed to be pres
ent there,'" he said. "But then I real
ized, it's okay if my mind wanders.
This is a pensive show."
The pensive experience has been
an influence on his vision for Paper
Void.
"I want to inspire in the way I've
been inspired," he said. "I want to do
it in the most accessible way, and not
in a snobby sense —very technical
music, but technical in away that you
don't notice. Something that doesn't
turn off the folks who have never lis
tened to music like that before."
Very technical music is some
thing that keeps the band together.
For their ideal band, the band mem
bers of Paper Void cite Hiatus Kaiy
ote, "multi-dimensional polyrhyth
mic gangster shit," according to the
band website, and a neo-soul band,
according to Wikipedia.
"I've been obsessing over them
for a year," Gitterman said. "They've
managed to fuse a multitude of gen
res that are both musically interest
ing and intellectually interesting,
but also incredibly visceral and
groove-filled."
The personal goal of improving
keeps each individual band member
going in the band.
"I get bored easily that's why
I could never be the bass in a tradi
tional rock band," Gitterman said,

who sometimes composes with
Leeper. "But I really like the direc
tion [Paper Void] has gone in. Even
when we're recording, people are
doing new things sometimes
good, sometimes not so good, but at
least I never feel like I'm stuck in a
rut."
When asked about the most diffi
cult thing Paper Void has had to
overcome, MC Alberto Guzman 'l3
paused. "I haven't really thought
about it. It's all very seamless."
Leeper does handle a lot as the
de-facto bandleader gigs, media,
rehearsals. After all, Paper Void was
initially his idea, his project. He is
professional, hyper-organized, laid
back, all at once.
Everything he plans for the band
is intentional, from the structure of
rehearsal (loosely modeled after
Stanford Taiko, where Leeper was
performance manager for a year) to
the people in the band (all incredibly
talented to minimize time spent out
side of practice, but also incredibly
reliable).
Recently, the members have each
been taking on side roles to help with
the expanding project.
While the members did not know
each other very well to begin with,
the skill of each individual was so
high that, as trumpeter player Isaac
Ghansah 'l3 M.S. 'l4 said, "It's never

a question of whether we can do it,
but how we're going to do it."
Tenor saxophonist Alex Ramsey
'l7 is the youngest and least experi
enced member of Paper Void, which
he caveated several times. But even
he has had a solo in nearly every gig
so far.
"When I'm nervous about solo
ing, Gavin's always like, 'Take more
solos!"' Ramsey said. "Then I realize
it's just me being nervous. I mean,
it's nerve-wracking because we're
playing for these big-deal shows
where everyone already has to step
up their game, and I feel I need to
play at their level but I'm looking
forward to having more time to work
on technical ability over summer at
home, maybe come down for the
weekends."
When asked how far home is,
Ramsey said, "Three hours, but the
commute is worth it."
Of the eight members of the
band, Favaro commutes for re
hearsals from San Francisco to Stan
ford two days a week, and then extra
days for gigs. Wright, too, commuted
from San Francisco for the band up
until this past Thursday when he of
ficially left Paper Void because of his
work hours and to focus more on his
own music production.
"Commuting is probably the
hardest part," Favaro said. "But it's

worth it for me to keep playing
music. If I weren't in this band, it'd
be hard for me to improve as a play
er, to justify playing."
Near the end of practice, Schreier
and Leeper hit the first two chords of
Hiatus Kaiyote's "Nakamarra," first
performed at EBF's Happy Hour
when I first heard Paper Void. Upon
hearing the major sevenths, the at
mosphere immediately changes.
Everyone is swaying to the
music, and they take turns passing
the microphone around, crooning,
"We'll see in time, opening our
hearts/And nurturing our minds to
shine/I love you, I love you, I do."
The band has only been playing
together for nine months, and
"Nakamarra" has been with them
since December as one of their most
familiar songs. While it hasn't been
played at many gigs, Leeper said
that people have come up to the band
and demanded for it to be played.
When I asked how the band be
came closer, Schreier said, "Music
brings people together."
And indeed, The Downtempo
Project has been more than just a
project —it has grown into Paper
Void.

is intentional, from the structure of
rehearsal (loosely modeled after
Stanford Taiko, where Leeper was
performance manager for a year) to
the people in the band (all incredibly
talented to minimize time spent out
side of practice, but also incredibly
reliable).
Recently, the members have each
been taking on side roles to help with
the expanding project.
While the members did not know
each other very well to begin with,
the skill of each individual was so
high that, as trumpeter player Isaac
Ghansah 'l3 M.S. 'l4 said, "It's never

a question of whether we can do it,
but how we're going to do it."
Tenor saxophonist Alex Ramsey
'l7 is the youngest and least experi
enced member of Paper Void, which
he caveated several times. But even
he has had a solo in nearly every gig
so far.
"When I'm nervous about solo
ing, Gavin's always like, 'Take more
solos!"' Ramsey said. "Then I realize
it's just me being nervous. I mean,
it's nerve-wracking because we're
playing for these big-deal shows
where everyone already has to step
up their game, and I feel I need to
play at their level but I'm looking
forward to having more time to work
on technical ability over summer at
home, maybe come down for the
weekends."
When asked how far home is,
Ramsey said, "Three hours, but the
commute is worth it."
Of the eight members of the
band, Favaro commutes for re
hearsals from San Francisco to Stan
ford two days a week, and then extra
days for gigs. Wright, too, commuted
from San Francisco for the band up
until this past Thursday when he of
ficially left Paper Void because of his
work hours and to focus more on his
own music production.
"Commuting is probably the
hardest part," Favaro said. "But it's

worth it for me to keep playing
music. If I weren't in this band, it'd
be hard for me to improve as a play
er, to justify playing."
Near the end of practice, Schreier
and Leeper hit the first two chords of
Hiatus Kaiyote's "Nakamarra," first
performed at EBF's Happy Hour
when I first heard Paper Void. Upon
hearing the major sevenths, the at
mosphere immediately changes.
Everyone is swaying to the
music, and they take turns passing
the microphone around, crooning,
"We'll see in time, opening our
hearts/And nurturing our minds to
shine/I love you, I love you, I do."
The band has only been playing
together for nine months, and
"Nakamarra" has been with them
since December as one of their most
familiar songs. While it hasn't been
played at many gigs, Leeper said
that people have come up to the band
and demanded for it to be played.
When I asked how the band be
came closer, Schreier said, "Music
brings people together."
And indeed, The Downtempo
Project has been more than just a
project —it has grown into Paper
Void.

The story of Paper Void's cre
ation began in the summer of 2013
when guitarist Gavin Leeper 'l3
M.S. 'l4 completed the Jazz Guitar
Intensive at the Jazz School at
Berkeley. On the second mile of his
meditative run, he was thinking
about music he loved Zero 7's
album, "Simple Things," for in
stance — when it occurred to him
that this was the type of music he
could be making with others.
The same day, he began to con
tact musicians for an eight-piece
band. A few days later, he met with
lead singer, JP Wright 'l2, former
front man of an up-tempo band, The
Irregulars, to discuss the logistics of
running a band. By the end of Sep
tember, the band had had its first re
hearsal.
From the start, the project was
ambitious "The Downtempo
Band Vision," Leeper's initial band
write-up, projected for the band's
first gig to be in fall quarter.
"I'm just saying, I want this
project to go places and go there
quickly," he wrote.
By week six, Leeper, who had al
ready been in contact with the Com
munity Managers of several co-ops
through previous DJ-ing gigs, se
cured a slot at Kairos' Wine and
Cheese on Wednesdays. After

wards, Paper Void continued to per
form through the year at Snowchel
la, the Enchanted Broccoli Forest
and Maggie McGarry's in San
Francisco.
The band performed at Beltane
last Saturday and will be opening at
Frost on May 17. Come the end of
June, Paper Void will finally be re
leasing their extended play of five
songs.
One of the few points of indeci
sion the band has faced is the band
name. Previously named "The
Downtempo Project" and "Shola,"
the band finally decided on "Paper
Void."
While the band's sound still re
flects downtempo music, a genre
from the '9os that knead together
electronic music, funk, jazz and hip
hop, the band wanted to use the
band name to emphasize a juxtapo
sition.
Although the music is downtem
po, Leeper said, "We play it at high
energy and there's this contrast,
similar to the name paper is this
thin material while void is infinite
and amorphous."
There is also a second meaning
to the name. Leeper was inspired by
his experience abroad in Japan in
spring 2012. In Japanese, ma is a
character that roughly means

"space," such as in calligraphy,
where shaping the white space of a
page is just as important as focusing
on the brush strokes; or "pause,"
such as in music.
Ma is particularly important for
an eight-piece band. While the band
members also including bassist
Evan Gitterman 'l4, keyboardist
Jeremy Schreier 'l4 and drummer
Alex Favaro 'l2 have since be
come closer through the medium of
music, they were initially just ac
quaintances, both musically and so
cially.
For jazz-style music especially,
this set-up could potentially be
problematic.
"When you're improvising in
jazz, you're supporting each other
through music," Schreier said. "The
more you play with each other, the
more familiar you are with each oth
ers' styles. Being friends outside of
music can add more depth to the
music it's an extra level of trust."
And yet, as the band recently
proved at Beltane, they had "re
fined the ma," Leeper said. In
songs such as then* cover of Submo
tion Orchestra's "All Night," the
synchronization is tangible when
the music suspends for just a mo
ment before blooming in the
warm spring ah* again.

A week ago, Leeper drove me
and my editor to Paper Void's bi
weekly rehearsal.
"Oh yeah, new development," he
said. "One of our singers can't make
it to Beltane."
Beltane is Synergy's annual
pagan festival that took place this
past Saturday. The guest singer was
a devout Christian.
"Wow," I said.
"It's okay" he said. "We'll make
it work."
He maneuvered his Audi onto
the pathway bordering the Band
Shack.
"Are you allowed to park here?"
I asked.
"Yeah," he said, lining his car up
with the building. A cluster of brass
instrumentalists from the Stanford
Marching Band looks up from prac
tice.
"Well, it's actually a loading
zone," he clarifies. "Some guy
comes in and yells at us sometimes
but it's okay."
Leeper wears his hair long, his
flannels tartan, his jeans rolled. His
attitude is best described as zen.
"I try to live on purpose," he said
when asked about his life philoso
phy. Did he mean "with purpose"?

Paper Void has seen their profile rise after starting off as a humble campus band. The group, whose music is described as Downtempo - mixing
electronic music, funk, jazz and hip-hop will open the Frost Music Festival. The eight members include a freshman and an alumni.
"On purpose like intentionally."
Apart from having studied medi
tation in Japan, he also meditates
through running "No music," he
said. "I count my breaths. It returns
me to my center."
Apparently, he meditates during
practice. The band members are
running through their set for
Beltane; versions of "That sounded
good," and "What if we did this?" are
tossed around.
"Yeah, yeah, I like that" Gavin
says at one point, and while his gui
tar is still slung across his body, he
casually reaches up, then out, into a
perfectly balanced yoga tree pose.
Leeper's taste in music is colored
with elements of this philosophy
he calls it "mindful music," and it is
complex while centered on a simple
yet profound idea, something he
mulls over and turns around in his
head. When he traveled over two
hours from Kyoto to Tokyo to see the
concert of one of his favorite bands,
Cinematic Orchestra, Leeper found
his mind wandering and instantly
felt guilty.
"I went through a lot to get to the

show, and I felt I needed to be pres
ent there,'" he said. "But then I real
ized, it's okay if my mind wanders.
This is a pensive show."
The pensive experience has been
an influence on his vision for Paper
Void.
"I want to inspire in the way I've
been inspired," he said. "I want to do
it in the most accessible way, and not
in a snobby sense —very technical
music, but technical in away that you
don't notice. Something that doesn't
turn off the folks who have never lis
tened to music like that before."
Very technical music is some
thing that keeps the band together.
For their ideal band, the band mem
bers of Paper Void cite Hiatus Kaiy
ote, "multi-dimensional polyrhyth
mic gangster shit," according to the
band website, and a neo-soul band,
according to Wikipedia.
"I've been obsessing over them
for a year," Gitterman said. "They've
managed to fuse a multitude of gen
res that are both musically interest
ing and intellectually interesting,
but also incredibly visceral and
groove-filled."
The personal goal of improving
keeps each individual band member
going in the band.
"I get bored easily that's why
I could never be the bass in a tradi
tional rock band," Gitterman said,

who sometimes composes with
Leeper. "But I really like the direc
tion [Paper Void] has gone in. Even
when we're recording, people are
doing new things sometimes
good, sometimes not so good, but at
least I never feel like I'm stuck in a
rut."
When asked about the most diffi
cult thing Paper Void has had to
overcome, MC Alberto Guzman 'l3
paused. "I haven't really thought
about it. It's all very seamless."
Leeper does handle a lot as the
de-facto bandleader gigs, media,
rehearsals. After all, Paper Void was
initially his idea, his project. He is
professional, hyper-organized, laid
back, all at once.
Everything he plans for the band

Apart from having studied medi
tation in Japan, he also meditates
through running "No music," he
said. "I count my breaths. It returns
me to my center."
Apparently, he meditates during
practice. The band members are
running through their set for
Beltane; versions of "That sounded
good," and "What if we did this?" are
tossed around.
"Yeah, yeah, I like that" Gavin
says at one point, and while his gui
tar is still slung across his body, he
casually reaches up, then out, into a
perfectly balanced yoga tree pose.
Leeper's taste in music is colored
with elements of this philosophy
he calls it "mindful music," and it is
complex while centered on a simple
yet profound idea, something he
mulls over and turns around in his
head. When he traveled over two
hours from Kyoto to Tokyo to see the
concert of one of his favorite bands,
Cinematic Orchestra, Leeper found
his mind wandering and instantly
felt guilty.
"I went through a lot to get to the

show, and I felt I needed to be pres
ent there,'" he said. "But then I real
ized, it's okay if my mind wanders.
This is a pensive show."
The pensive experience has been
an influence on his vision for Paper
Void.
"I want to inspire in the way I've
been inspired," he said. "I want to do
it in the most accessible way, and not
in a snobby sense —very technical
music, but technical in away that you
don't notice. Something that doesn't
turn off the folks who have never lis
tened to music like that before."
Very technical music is some
thing that keeps the band together.
For their ideal band, the band mem
bers of Paper Void cite Hiatus Kaiy
ote, "multi-dimensional polyrhyth
mic gangster shit," according to the
band website, and a neo-soul band,
according to Wikipedia.
"I've been obsessing over them
for a year," Gitterman said. "They've
managed to fuse a multitude of gen
res that are both musically interest
ing and intellectually interesting,
but also incredibly visceral and
groove-filled."
The personal goal of improving
keeps each individual band member
going in the band.
"I get bored easily that's why
I could never be the bass in a tradi
tional rock band," Gitterman said,

who sometimes composes with
Leeper. "But I really like the direc
tion [Paper Void] has gone in. Even
when we're recording, people are
doing new things sometimes
good, sometimes not so good, but at
least I never feel like I'm stuck in a
rut."
When asked about the most diffi
cult thing Paper Void has had to
overcome, MC Alberto Guzman 'l3
paused. "I haven't really thought
about it. It's all very seamless."
Leeper does handle a lot as the
de-facto bandleader gigs, media,
rehearsals. After all, Paper Void was
initially his idea, his project. He is
professional, hyper-organized, laid
back, all at once.
Everything he plans for the band
is intentional, from the structure of
rehearsal (loosely modeled after
Stanford Taiko, where Leeper was
performance manager for a year) to
the people in the band (all incredibly
talented to minimize time spent out
side of practice, but also incredibly
reliable).
Recently, the members have each
been taking on side roles to help with
the expanding project.
While the members did not know
each other very well to begin with,
the skill of each individual was so
high that, as trumpeter player Isaac
Ghansah 'l3 M.S. 'l4 said, "It's never

a question of whether we can do it,
but how we're going to do it."
Tenor saxophonist Alex Ramsey
'l7 is the youngest and least experi
enced member of Paper Void, which
he caveated several times. But even
he has had a solo in nearly every gig
so far.
"When I'm nervous about solo
ing, Gavin's always like, 'Take more
solos!"' Ramsey said. "Then I realize
it's just me being nervous. I mean,
it's nerve-wracking because we're
playing for these big-deal shows
where everyone already has to step
up their game, and I feel I need to
play at their level but I'm looking
forward to having more time to work
on technical ability over summer at
home, maybe come down for the
weekends."
When asked how far home is,
Ramsey said, "Three hours, but the
commute is worth it."
Of the eight members of the
band, Favaro commutes for re
hearsals from San Francisco to Stan
ford two days a week, and then extra
days for gigs. Wright, too, commuted
from San Francisco for the band up
until this past Thursday when he of
ficially left Paper Void because of his
work hours and to focus more on his
own music production.
"Commuting is probably the
hardest part," Favaro said. "But it's

worth it for me to keep playing
music. If I weren't in this band, it'd
be hard for me to improve as a play
er, to justify playing."
Near the end of practice, Schreier
and Leeper hit the first two chords of
Hiatus Kaiyote's "Nakamarra," first
performed at EBF's Happy Hour
when I first heard Paper Void. Upon
hearing the major sevenths, the at
mosphere immediately changes.
Everyone is swaying to the
music, and they take turns passing
the microphone around, crooning,
"We'll see in time, opening our
hearts/And nurturing our minds to
shine/I love you, I love you, I do."
The band has only been playing
together for nine months, and
"Nakamarra" has been with them
since December as one of their most
familiar songs. While it hasn't been
played at many gigs, Leeper said
that people have come up to the band
and demanded for it to be played.
When I asked how the band be
came closer, Schreier said, "Music
brings people together."
And indeed, The Downtempo
Project has been more than just a
project —it has grown into Paper
Void.

The story of Paper Void's cre
ation began in the summer of 2013
when guitarist Gavin Leeper 'l3
M.S. 'l4 completed the Jazz Guitar
Intensive at the Jazz School at
Berkeley. On the second mile of his
meditative run, he was thinking
about music he loved Zero 7's
album, "Simple Things," for in
stance — when it occurred to him
that this was the type of music he
could be making with others.
The same day, he began to con
tact musicians for an eight-piece
band. A few days later, he met with
lead singer, JP Wright 'l2, former
front man of an up-tempo band, The
Irregulars, to discuss the logistics of
running a band. By the end of Sep
tember, the band had had its first re
hearsal.
From the start, the project was
ambitious "The Downtempo
Band Vision," Leeper's initial band
write-up, projected for the band's
first gig to be in fall quarter.
"I'm just saying, I want this
project to go places and go there
quickly," he wrote.
By week six, Leeper, who had al
ready been in contact with the Com
munity Managers of several co-ops
through previous DJ-ing gigs, se
cured a slot at Kairos' Wine and
Cheese on Wednesdays. After

wards, Paper Void continued to per
form through the year at Snowchel
la, the Enchanted Broccoli Forest
and Maggie McGarry's in San
Francisco.
The band performed at Beltane
last Saturday and will be opening at
Frost on May 17. Come the end of
June, Paper Void will finally be re
leasing their extended play of five
songs.
One of the few points of indeci
sion the band has faced is the band
name. Previously named "The
Downtempo Project" and "Shola,"
the band finally decided on "Paper
Void."
While the band's sound still re
flects downtempo music, a genre
from the '9os that knead together
electronic music, funk, jazz and hip
hop, the band wanted to use the
band name to emphasize a juxtapo
sition.
Although the music is downtem
po, Leeper said, "We play it at high
energy and there's this contrast,
similar to the name paper is this
thin material while void is infinite
and amorphous."
There is also a second meaning
to the name. Leeper was inspired by
his experience abroad in Japan in
spring 2012. In Japanese, ma is a
character that roughly means

"space," such as in calligraphy,
where shaping the white space of a
page is just as important as focusing
on the brush strokes; or "pause,"
such as in music.
Ma is particularly important for
an eight-piece band. While the band
members also including bassist
Evan Gitterman 'l4, keyboardist
Jeremy Schreier 'l4 and drummer
Alex Favaro 'l2 have since be
come closer through the medium of
music, they were initially just ac
quaintances, both musically and so
cially.
For jazz-style music especially,
this set-up could potentially be
problematic.
"When you're improvising in
jazz, you're supporting each other
through music," Schreier said. "The
more you play with each other, the
more familiar you are with each oth
ers' styles. Being friends outside of
music can add more depth to the
music it's an extra level of trust."
And yet, as the band recently
proved at Beltane, they had "re
fined the ma," Leeper said. In
songs such as then* cover of Submo
tion Orchestra's "All Night," the
synchronization is tangible when
the music suspends for just a mo
ment before blooming in the
warm spring ah* again.

A week ago, Leeper drove me
and my editor to Paper Void's bi
weekly rehearsal.
"Oh yeah, new development," he
said. "One of our singers can't make
it to Beltane."
Beltane is Synergy's annual
pagan festival that took place this
past Saturday. The guest singer was
a devout Christian.
"Wow," I said.
"It's okay" he said. "We'll make
it work."
He maneuvered his Audi onto
the pathway bordering the Band
Shack.
"Are you allowed to park here?"
I asked.
"Yeah," he said, lining his car up
with the building. A cluster of brass
instrumentalists from the Stanford
Marching Band looks up from prac
tice.
"Well, it's actually a loading
zone," he clarifies. "Some guy
comes in and yells at us sometimes
but it's okay."
Leeper wears his hair long, his
flannels tartan, his jeans rolled. His
attitude is best described as zen.
"I try to live on purpose," he said
when asked about his life philoso
phy. Did he mean "with purpose"?
