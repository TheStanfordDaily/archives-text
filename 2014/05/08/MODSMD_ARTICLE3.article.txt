# Paper Void finds new space
## Stanford student band will open Frost Music Festival on May 19 
### IRENE HSU | DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
The story of Paper Void's cre
ation began in the summer of 2013
when guitarist Gavin Leeper 'l3
M.S. 'l4 completed the Jazz Guitar
Intensive at the Jazz School at
Berkeley. On the second mile of his
meditative run, he was thinking
about music he loved Zero 7's
album, "Simple Things," for in
stance â€” when it occurred to him
that this was the type of music he
could be making with others.
The same day, he began to con
tact musicians for an eight-piece
band. A few days later, he met with
lead singer, JP Wright 'l2, former
front man of an up-tempo band, The
Irregulars, to discuss the logistics of
running a band. By the end of Sep
tember, the band had had its first re
hearsal.
From the start, the project was
ambitious "The Downtempo
Band Vision," Leeper's initial band
write-up, projected for the band's
first gig to be in fall quarter.
"I'm just saying, I want this
project to go places and go there
quickly," he wrote.
By week six, Leeper, who had al
ready been in contact with the Com
munity Managers of several co-ops
through previous DJ-ing gigs, se
cured a slot at Kairos' Wine and
Cheese on Wednesdays. After

wards, Paper Void continued to per
form through the year at Snowchel
la, the Enchanted Broccoli Forest
and Maggie McGarry's in San
Francisco.
The band performed at Beltane
last Saturday and will be opening at
Frost on May 17. Come the end of
June, Paper Void will finally be re
leasing their extended play of five
songs.
One of the few points of indeci
sion the band has faced is the band
name. Previously named "The
Downtempo Project" and "Shola,"
the band finally decided on "Paper
Void."
While the band's sound still re
flects downtempo music, a genre
from the '9os that knead together
electronic music, funk, jazz and hip
hop, the band wanted to use the
band name to emphasize a juxtapo
sition.
Although the music is downtem
po, Leeper said, "We play it at high
energy and there's this contrast,
similar to the name paper is this
thin material while void is infinite
and amorphous."
There is also a second meaning
to the name. Leeper was inspired by
his experience abroad in Japan in
spring 2012. In Japanese, ma is a
character that roughly means

"space," such as in calligraphy,
where shaping the white space of a
page is just as important as focusing
on the brush strokes; or "pause,"
such as in music.
Ma is particularly important for
an eight-piece band. While the band
members also including bassist
Evan Gitterman 'l4, keyboardist
Jeremy Schreier 'l4 and drummer
Alex Favaro 'l2 have since be
come closer through the medium of
music, they were initially just ac
quaintances, both musically and so
cially.
For jazz-style music especially,
this set-up could potentially be
problematic.
"When you're improvising in
jazz, you're supporting each other
through music," Schreier said. "The
more you play with each other, the
more familiar you are with each oth
ers' styles. Being friends outside of
music can add more depth to the
music it's an extra level of trust."
And yet, as the band recently
proved at Beltane, they had "re
fined the ma," Leeper said. In
songs such as then* cover of Submo
tion Orchestra's "All Night," the
synchronization is tangible when
the music suspends for just a mo
ment before blooming in the
warm spring ah* again.

A week ago, Leeper drove me
and my editor to Paper Void's bi
weekly rehearsal.
"Oh yeah, new development," he
said. "One of our singers can't make
it to Beltane."
Beltane is Synergy's annual
pagan festival that took place this
past Saturday. The guest singer was
a devout Christian.
"Wow," I said.
"It's okay" he said. "We'll make
it work."
He maneuvered his Audi onto
the pathway bordering the Band
Shack.
"Are you allowed to park here?"
I asked.
"Yeah," he said, lining his car up
with the building. A cluster of brass
instrumentalists from the Stanford
Marching Band looks up from prac
tice.
"Well, it's actually a loading
zone," he clarifies. "Some guy
comes in and yells at us sometimes
but it's okay."
Leeper wears his hair long, his
flannels tartan, his jeans rolled. His
attitude is best described as zen.
"I try to live on purpose," he said
when asked about his life philoso
phy. Did he mean "with purpose"?
