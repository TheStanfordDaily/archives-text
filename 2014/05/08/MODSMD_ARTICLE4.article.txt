# REELING IT IN
## CAN CARDINAL CATCH THE BIG PRIZE? 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
You would be hard-pressed to find a
more decorated and successful
Stanford Athletics program over
the past few years than women's
water polo. Stanford women's
water polo has been to four straight national
championship games. It has won two of the
last three national titles. This year, it had
seven players named to all-conference teams.
Two of its top players won gold medals for the
United States at the London Olympics in
2012, including leading scorer and Olympic
MVP Maggie Steffens, a current sophomore.
The team has finished the last five regular
seasons ranked No. 1 in the nation.
Yet, despite all the accolades, one achieve
ment seemed to always escape the Card: the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF)
conference title. Even with its pair of nation
al titles, Stanford had not won its conference
title since all the way back in 2006.

Last year, it was USC who took down the
No. 1 Cardinal in the MPSF title game, as the
Trojans jumped ahead early by five goals. In
2012, UCLA upset top-seeded Stanford in
overtime of the MPSF title game at Avery
Aquatics Center, snapping the Cardinal's 37-
game home winning streak. And again, in
2011, the undefeated Card dropped their first
game of the season in the semifinals of the
MPSF Tournament to No. 4 UCLA. For the
past seven seasons, the MPSF Tournament
and the Bruins in particular had not been
kind to Stanford; UCLA knocked Stanford
out in four of those seven tournaments.
That all changed just over a week ago,
however, when the top-ranked Cardinal fit
tingly defeated No. 2 UCLA 6-5 in a thrilling
comeback victory to capture that elusive
MPSF title for the first time since 2006. After
trailing 5-3 at halftime, Stanford shut out
UCLA the rest of the way, scoring the final
three goals and thus finishing the MPSF
Tournament with a resounding statement.
