# REELING IT IN
## CAN CARDINAL CATCH THE BIG PRIZE? 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
You would be hard-pressed to find a
more decorated and successful
Stanford Athletics program over
the past few years than women's
water polo. Stanford women's
water polo has been to four straight national
championship games. It has won two of the
last three national titles. This year, it had
seven players named to all-conference teams.
Two of its top players won gold medals for the
United States at the London Olympics in
2012, including leading scorer and Olympic
MVP Maggie Steffens, a current sophomore.
The team has finished the last five regular
seasons ranked No. 1 in the nation.
Yet, despite all the accolades, one achieve
ment seemed to always escape the Card: the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF)
conference title. Even with its pair of nation
al titles, Stanford had not won its conference
title since all the way back in 2006.

Last year, it was USC who took down the
No. 1 Cardinal in the MPSF title game, as the
Trojans jumped ahead early by five goals. In
2012, UCLA upset top-seeded Stanford in
overtime of the MPSF title game at Avery
Aquatics Center, snapping the Cardinal's 37-
game home winning streak. And again, in
2011, the undefeated Card dropped their first
game of the season in the semifinals of the
MPSF Tournament to No. 4 UCLA. For the
past seven seasons, the MPSF Tournament
and the Bruins in particular had not been
kind to Stanford; UCLA knocked Stanford
out in four of those seven tournaments.
That all changed just over a week ago,
however, when the top-ranked Cardinal fit
tingly defeated No. 2 UCLA 6-5 in a thrilling
comeback victory to capture that elusive
MPSF title for the first time since 2006. After
trailing 5-3 at halftime, Stanford shut out
UCLA the rest of the way, scoring the final
three goals and thus finishing the MPSF
Tournament with a resounding statement.

"It shows that we have re
silience," said junior Kiley Neushul,
who leads the team in scoring and
was recently named to the All-
MPSF first team. "We didn't get
lazy before the NCAA Tournament.
My freshman year, I felt that we
powered through that tournament
and UCLA actually beat us fairly
we played a strong game against
them. My sophomore year, it was
lackadaisical, like we didn't care
about the MPSF and we were only
looking at one goal. This year, we're
more focused on every game and
every possession."
While the MPSF Tournament
had no postseason implications, as
the Cardinal would easily have re
ceived a wild card berth into the
NCAA Tournament even if they had
lost, it did provide a unique training
experience with games on back-to
back days against stellar competi
tion. Additionally, the added bonus
for this year's tournament was that
it took place at USC's new Uytengsu
Aquatics Center, which will also
serve as the site for the upcoming

NCAA Tournament this weekend.
"I think the opportunity to play
at USC for the first time in that new
pool and be the first to win an MPSF
championship there was really fun
for us, and gave us a tool to have in
our back pocket," Steffens said.
Historically, the MPSF has been
by far the country's most difficult
conference to play women's water
polo. For five straight years, all at
large bids to the N CAA Tournament
have come from MPSF teams. The
last 13 women's water polo national
champions are from the MPSF. To
win the MPSF Tournament is ar
guably just as difficult as winning
the NCAA Tournament.
"It's one of those things that you
look back on and say, 'You know, this
is a great conference, but we've won
the regular season title a couple of
times,"' said head coach John Tan
ner. "It was fun to go down there and
put two really good games together.
As much as anything, we just
haven't done that before or in a
while."
In recent years, the MPSF has

become even stronger. The top five
teams in the NCAA Tournament
this season hail from the MPSF
Stanford, UCLA, USC, Cal and
Arizona State. The Sun Devils
made the tournament this year for
the first time in program history,
and if there was one more at-large
bid, it likely would have gone to fel
low MPSF team San Jose State,
which went 20-13 overall and 2-4 in
conference play only a year after fin
ishing 14-11 overall and 1-8 in con
ference play. Winning the confer
ence tournament was no small feat
for the Cardinal.
"At the end of the day, the MPSF
championship isn't as important as
the NCAA championship, but the
fact that we were able to win that
tight game against UCLA and have
a very good semifinal makes our
team stronger," Neushul said. "Mov
ing forward, having those games
under our belt where we performed
during a pressure situation will be
very beneficial."
Ultimately, the goal for the Car
dinal lies beyond the MPSF Tourna

ment, but it certainly showcased
why this year's team might be more
prepared than ever to make another
run at a national championship. Not
only does the team possess superior
talent and the confidence from the
MPSF Tournament win, but the
Card also enter this weekend's
NCAA Tournament still driven by
memories of last year's national
championship defeat.
"I was grateful to have the oppor
tunity to play in the national champi
onship and for our team to play in
the national championship, but
there's nothing like having that
loss," Steffens said of last year's
loss. "The feeling of being so close to
something and not being able to get
it, it's definitely motivation."
