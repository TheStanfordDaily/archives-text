# CANADIAN CATASTROPHE
## Pesky Persky picked press president 
### SCOOP SCOOPERSTEIN 
my accomplishments at The
Daily can be a wonderful
thing for my school, cowork
ers, friends and family. At the
same time, I realize that my
mistakes are magnified and
can bring great embarrass
ment to all those who have
supported me and continue to
support me."
In the spirit of the Joseph
Beyda 'l5, George Chen 'l5
and Sam Fisher 'l4 master
piece "Rags to Roses" (avail
able for $14.99 at the Stanford
Bookstore), Persky plans to
release a defiant tell-all over
the summer entitled "If I Did
It."
Seventy-seven percent of
voters believe that she
definitely did it.
Maddy B. Sides Director
of Photography Sam Girvin
'l6 withdrew his housing ap
plication seconds after the
election.
"Jana has always been my
Daily buddy. When she's at
the office, I have to be at the
office, no matter how worn
those couches may be."
Executive Editor Mar
shall Watkins 'l5 chose to
plead the fifth when asked
about the state of the couches.
Chief Persky supporter
and Head Copy Editor Alice
Phillips 'l5 was ecstatic with
the results of last night's elec
tion.
"It's wonderful to have
someone who shares my pas
sion for Oxford commas sit
upon the editorial throne,"
Phillips said. "We've success
fully changed verb conjuga
tion with 'Cardinal' from sin
gular to plural. The next step
is finally changing 'The Stan
ford Cardinal' to 'A Stanford
Cardinals.'"
Persky selected Cameron
Miller 'l6 as the Ivan Maisel
Daily Liaison to the NCAA.
Miller is said to be in the
process of lobbying the
NCAA for additional money
to deal with a rash of broken
ankles caused by student-ath
lete member(s) of The Daily.
News anchor Catherine
Zaw 'l5 was too busy writing
the first, second and fourth
news stories of tonight's
paper to comment.

Just after the tick of mid
night as May 7 became May 8,
21-year-old, half-Canadian,
full sophomore Jana Persky
'l6 was elected Prime Minis
ter of The Stanford Daily dur
ing a gathering of the elders
and Do-Hyoung Park '24.
With her campaign song
"Baby," performed live by
Canada's greatest represen
tative, in the background,
Persky addressed a raucous
crowd of supporters.
"This is not about diplo
macy, this is aboot dignity,"
Persky said. "This is aboot re
spect. This is about realizing
the future of The Daily."
When asked how a Cana
dian* could ever be entrusted
with one of America's great
est cultural institutions, Per
sky replied, "I don't need to
justify myself to the
lamestream media."
Persky's emphasis on
equality extends not only to
national heritage, but also
gender equality. In an at
tempt to rectify four volumes'
worth of male leadership,
Persky has decreed that male
staffers will be paid 77 cents
on the dollar.
Under a Persky adminis
tration, the latent (metro)sex
ual appeal of Tom Brady will
replace departing fifth-year
senior Shayne Skov 'l3 as the
First Football Citizen of The
Stanford Daily. Defending his
own pro-Patriots credentials,
departing William M. Gal
lagher Editor in Chief George
Chen 'l5 pointed to the Brady
jersey hanging on the wall of
the Daily office.
"I love Tom Brady more
than anyone," Chen said.
"I'M THE BIGGEST
BRADY LOVER IN THE
GAME."
The election results have
been cast into doubt by a re
cent scandal. Earlier this
week, Persky was arrested
for stealing frozen crab legs
from the secret Safeway.
"I realize that I am in the
public spotlight and my con
duct needs to be above re
proach," Persky said. "Over
the last year, I've learned that

aging Editor of Conflicts of
Interest and Pope Winston
Shi 'l6 offered to comment in
her stead.
"I am both proud and hon
ored to have been elected Ed
itor in Chief of Volume 247.
Can we talk downstairs for a
moment?"
In sadder news, The Stan
ford Daily saw the resurrec
tion of former news desk edi
tor Ed Ngai 'ls's career.
Ngai, an allegedly full Cana
dian and the Volume 244
Supreme Allied Commander,
will join the Council of Elders
as deliverer of the format-to

be-determined Residential &
Dining Enterprises food,
which promises to be
healthy, cheap, quick and
environmentally con
scious.
The Daily regrets this
error.
*Disclaimer: Persky was
born in London (NOT the
Ontario one) and spent
her childhood in New
Canaan, Connecticut.
