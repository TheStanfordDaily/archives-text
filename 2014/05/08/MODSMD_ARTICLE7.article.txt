## Infusions of young blood revitalize old mice's brains 
### â€“ Marshall Watkins 
Researchers from the
School of Medicine have
found that the blood of young
mice may have a restorative
effect on the mental capabil
ities of older mice, a discov
ery that could open up new
therapeutic approaches to
treating human afflictions
like Alzheimer's disease.
The researchers exam
ined the performance of
older mice that had received
infusions of plasma from
young mice against a control
group on standard laborato
ry tests of spatial memory.
While previous experiments
had established a positive re
lationship between the
transfusions and general
nerve cell growth in older
mice, the researchers' more
recent study identified a
demonstrable improvement
in various behavioral meas-

ures as well.
"It was as if these old
brains were recharged by
young blood," said study
senior author Tony Wyss-

Cor ay.
The team paid particular
attention to the hippocam
pus, a part of the brain that is
critical to both humans and
mice in terms of recalling
and recognizing spatial pat
terns, which typically erodes
in function with age. The hip
pocampi of old mice that had
received transfusions pro
duced more substances
linked to learning, demon
strating an enhanced ability
to strengthen connections
between nerve cells.
Following the study's

findings, the researchers
plan to further investigate
precisely which factor or fac
tors within the plasma influ
ence brain function in older
mice, and to assess whether
a similar method might
prove effective in humans.
