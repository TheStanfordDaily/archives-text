# Stanford acquires source code for first online world
## 
### â€” Andrew Vogeley 
Stanford University Li
braries recently took a trip
back to the not-so-distant
past when it acquired the
original source code for the
first online virtual world,
MUDI.
Multi-User Dungeon
(MUDI) was a text-based
adventure in which individu
als typed in commands to
progress through the game.
The virtual world marked a
step forward compared to
previous offerings because it
allowed users to play the
game online, rather than
being forced to play it alone.
The initial version of the
game allowed users to solve
puzzles in collaboration with
other people. As the game
grew and evolved, users
were allowed to attack other
characters and build their
own castles.
The game was created in
1978 by students from Essex
University in England.
While it can be played online
currently, Stanford plans to
make the original source
code available online at some
point in the near future.
