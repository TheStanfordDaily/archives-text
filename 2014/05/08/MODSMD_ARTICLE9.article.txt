## STANFORD FOOTBALL PRIME PROSPECTS 
### 
The NFL Draft begins today at 5 p.m. and will continue through Sunday.
The Daily breaks down the prospects for Stanford's top departing players hoping to have their names called this weekend

Cameron Fleming, OT
Projected 2nd/3rd Round

Cardinal career
Fleming jumped into a starting role on the 0-
line his sophomore year and received All-Pac
-12 honorable mention. As a junior, he was
again named AII-Pac-12 honorable mention,
starting all 14 games at right tackle. Then dur
ing his senior year, Fleming anchored the right
side of a veteran offensive line that was sev
enth in the nation in tackles for loss allowed.
Pro stock
The 6-foot-5,320-pound lineman possesses
the big frame and powerful blocking skills to
be an NFL tackle for many years. He won't be
outmuscled by any defensive lineman and ex
cels in run blocking. In order to further com
plete his game, Fleming will look to improve in
pass blocking against speed rushers on the
outside. He has nonetheless been shooting up
draft boards and will potentially be the first
Cardinal athlete taken in the draft. -

Shayne Skov, ILB
Projected 3rd/4th Round

Cardinal career
Skov finished his five-year Cardinal career
sixth on Stanford's all-time tackle list (354)
and racked up a bevy of second- and third
team All-America honors to cap 2013, but
more importantly, Skov will be remembered
as the face (and voice) of a resurgent Cardinal
defense that reached four straight BCS bowls
and as the linebacker who led the nerds to
revenge.
Pro stock
Skov's intensity and leadership are hard to ig
nore, and he's a proven pass-rusher and open
field tackier. The jury is out on how he will fare
in pass coverage at the next level; the verdict
on his run-stopping ability was reached long
ago. In some camps, there may be lingering
concerns about Skov's speed since his knee
injury, but if scouts are flipping on his 2012
tape, it's their loss.-

Ed Reynolds, FS
Projected 4th/5th Round

Cardinal career
After bouncing back from a knee injury suf
fered in practice, Reynolds nearly tied NCAA
records for interception return yards (302) and
pick-sixes (4) in a season in 2012, with a ques
tionable call costing him both marks by the
slimmest of margins. Despite his limited
chances to step in front of passes in 2013,
Reynolds was still named a first team Ail-
American by both CBSSports.com and Athlon
Sports.
Pro stock
Reynolds certainly passes the eye test, with
scouts taking note of his NFL-caliber physicali
ty and speed. His instincts are a big plus as
well. But Reynolds may need to improve his
open-field tackling and keep his aggressive
ness in check if he wants to add to the growing
list of Stanford defensive backs succeeding at
the next level. -

Josh Mauro, DE
Proiected 6th Round

Cardinal career
Mauro flew mostly under the radar in his first
three years, despite appearing as a reserve in
22 games during his redshirt freshman and
sophomore seasons. That changed in 2012,
when he racked up 6 sacks, 19 tackles and 2
fumble recoveries as one of Stanford's first
defensive linemen off the bench. Then in
2013, he broke out by starting 11 games and
recording 51 tackles (more than double the
total of any other true D-lineman on the team).
Pro stock
Scouts are evaluating Mauro as a competitive,
physical D-lineman who could contribute at
the next level. Mauro is not expected to be a
successful pass-rusher in the NFL — he ran
the slowest 40-yard dash time (5.21) of the 28
defensive ends at the NFL Combine — but his
strength is encouraging. A late-round draft se
lection is certainly not out of the question. -

Trent Murphy, OLB/DE
Projected 2nd/3rd Round

Cardinal career
The country-strong Arizona native first made a
major impact as a junior for the Card, starting
all 13 games and finishing with 6.5 sacks.
However, Murphy really broke onto the scene
as a senior; the AP third-team Ail-American and
AII-Pac-12 first teamer recorded 10 sacks, the
most by a Cardinal defender since 2004, and
18 tackles for loss, the most since 2000.
Pro stock
The strong, physical defender is somewhat un
fairly viewed as a "tweener" that lacks the bulk
to play on the D-line and the speed to play line
backer, despite having played both well in col
lege. He has the explosiveness to blow through
the line and also the finesse and speed to
weave his way by 0-linemen, as evidenced by
the variety of his sacks and his performance in
the three-cone drill at the combine, where he
had the second-best time by a linebacker. -

David Yankey, OG
Projected 4th/sth Round

Cardinal career
Over his final two seasons, Yankey became the
lead blocker for two 1,500-yard rushers. He
won the Morris Trophy as the Pac-12's top of
fensive lineman in 2012, earning consensus
All-America honors that year, and he followed
through in 2013 again to the tune of unani
mous All-America recognition. He's been the
sledgehammer behind the Cardinal's beloved
power running game for two-plus years.
Pro stock
Even though he entered 2013 as perhaps Stan
ford's most coveted pro prospect, Yankey has
fallen on most draft boards since then. His
physicality, size and experience aren't in doubt;
rather, most scouting services identify techni
cal imperfections that will hold Yankey back.
Yankey may not be the early-round pick he was
once expected to be, but he'll most likely hear
his name called on Friday or early Saturday. -

Tyler Gaffney, RB
Projected 6th Round

Cardinal career
Gaffney returned to Stanford in 2013 after one
year of professional baseball to play his senior
season of football a season that would ulti
mately go down as one of the greatest by a
tailback in Stanford history. Expected to be a
part of a "running back by committee," Gaffney
quickly took over the starting role for himself
and finished the season with 1,709 rushing
yards on 330 rushing attempts, both second
all-time in Cardinal history.
Pro stock
Gaffney proved his ability to be a strong,
durable runner with his senior year perform
ance, consistently churning his legs to pick up
the extra few yards. Scouts worry about his
agility and breakaway speed in the NFL, how
ever, as his 5-foot-11,220-pound frame may
not be enough to consistently power through
bigger opponents in the NFL. -

Ben Gardner, DE
Drniar»+aH iinHrof+arl

Cardinal career
One of the defining Stanford players of his
generation, Gardner came to the Farm as a
two-star recruit but blossomed into much
more. Although his fifth season was cut short
by a torn pectoral injury suffered in the closing
moments in a win at Oregon State, the captain
was still named to the AII-Pac-12 first team
with 7.5 tackles and 4.5 sacks on the season.
Pro stock
After he was not invited to the NFL Combine,
Gardner exploded at Stanford's pro day with a
39.5-inch vertical jump and a 10-foot-2 broad
jump, numbers that would have placed him
second and fifth, respectively, among defen
sive ends at the combine. His strength and
athleticism alone should be enough to land
him a job, but he is likely a later round pick be
cause scouts are down on his ability to speed
rush from the edge.-

The Daily breaks down the prospects for Stanford's top departing players hoping to have their names called this weekend

Cameron Fleming, OT
Projected 2nd/3rd Round

Cardinal career
Fleming jumped into a starting role on the 0-
line his sophomore year and received All-Pac
-12 honorable mention. As a junior, he was
again named AII-Pac-12 honorable mention,
starting all 14 games at right tackle. Then dur
ing his senior year, Fleming anchored the right
side of a veteran offensive line that was sev
enth in the nation in tackles for loss allowed.
Pro stock
The 6-foot-5,320-pound lineman possesses
the big frame and powerful blocking skills to
be an NFL tackle for many years. He won't be
outmuscled by any defensive lineman and ex
cels in run blocking. In order to further com
plete his game, Fleming will look to improve in
pass blocking against speed rushers on the
outside. He has nonetheless been shooting up
draft boards and will potentially be the first
Cardinal athlete taken in the draft. -

Shayne Skov, ILB
Projected 3rd/4th Round

Cardinal career
Skov finished his five-year Cardinal career
sixth on Stanford's all-time tackle list (354)
and racked up a bevy of second- and third
team All-America honors to cap 2013, but
more importantly, Skov will be remembered
as the face (and voice) of a resurgent Cardinal
defense that reached four straight BCS bowls
and as the linebacker who led the nerds to
revenge.
Pro stock
Skov's intensity and leadership are hard to ig
nore, and he's a proven pass-rusher and open
field tackier. The jury is out on how he will fare
in pass coverage at the next level; the verdict
on his run-stopping ability was reached long
ago. In some camps, there may be lingering
concerns about Skov's speed since his knee
injury, but if scouts are flipping on his 2012
tape, it's their loss.-

Ed Reynolds, FS
Projected 4th/5th Round

Cardinal career
After bouncing back from a knee injury suf
fered in practice, Reynolds nearly tied NCAA
records for interception return yards (302) and
pick-sixes (4) in a season in 2012, with a ques
tionable call costing him both marks by the
slimmest of margins. Despite his limited
chances to step in front of passes in 2013,
Reynolds was still named a first team Ail-
American by both CBSSports.com and Athlon
Sports.
Pro stock
Reynolds certainly passes the eye test, with
scouts taking note of his NFL-caliber physicali
ty and speed. His instincts are a big plus as
well. But Reynolds may need to improve his
open-field tackling and keep his aggressive
ness in check if he wants to add to the growing
list of Stanford defensive backs succeeding at
the next level. -

Josh Mauro, DE
Proiected 6th Round

Cardinal career
Mauro flew mostly under the radar in his first
three years, despite appearing as a reserve in
22 games during his redshirt freshman and
sophomore seasons. That changed in 2012,
when he racked up 6 sacks, 19 tackles and 2
fumble recoveries as one of Stanford's first
defensive linemen off the bench. Then in
2013, he broke out by starting 11 games and
recording 51 tackles (more than double the
total of any other true D-lineman on the team).
Pro stock
Scouts are evaluating Mauro as a competitive,
physical D-lineman who could contribute at
the next level. Mauro is not expected to be a
successful pass-rusher in the NFL — he ran
the slowest 40-yard dash time (5.21) of the 28
defensive ends at the NFL Combine — but his
strength is encouraging. A late-round draft se
lection is certainly not out of the question. -

Trent Murphy, OLB/DE
Projected 2nd/3rd Round

Cardinal career
The country-strong Arizona native first made a
major impact as a junior for the Card, starting
all 13 games and finishing with 6.5 sacks.
However, Murphy really broke onto the scene
as a senior; the AP third-team Ail-American and
AII-Pac-12 first teamer recorded 10 sacks, the
most by a Cardinal defender since 2004, and
18 tackles for loss, the most since 2000.
Pro stock
The strong, physical defender is somewhat un
fairly viewed as a "tweener" that lacks the bulk
to play on the D-line and the speed to play line
backer, despite having played both well in col
lege. He has the explosiveness to blow through
the line and also the finesse and speed to
weave his way by 0-linemen, as evidenced by
the variety of his sacks and his performance in
the three-cone drill at the combine, where he
had the second-best time by a linebacker. -

David Yankey, OG
Projected 4th/sth Round

Cardinal career
Over his final two seasons, Yankey became the
lead blocker for two 1,500-yard rushers. He
won the Morris Trophy as the Pac-12's top of
fensive lineman in 2012, earning consensus
All-America honors that year, and he followed
through in 2013 again to the tune of unani
mous All-America recognition. He's been the
sledgehammer behind the Cardinal's beloved
power running game for two-plus years.
Pro stock
Even though he entered 2013 as perhaps Stan
ford's most coveted pro prospect, Yankey has
fallen on most draft boards since then. His
physicality, size and experience aren't in doubt;
rather, most scouting services identify techni
cal imperfections that will hold Yankey back.
Yankey may not be the early-round pick he was
once expected to be, but he'll most likely hear
his name called on Friday or early Saturday. -

Tyler Gaffney, RB
Projected 6th Round

Cardinal career
Gaffney returned to Stanford in 2013 after one
year of professional baseball to play his senior
season of football a season that would ulti
mately go down as one of the greatest by a
tailback in Stanford history. Expected to be a
part of a "running back by committee," Gaffney
quickly took over the starting role for himself
and finished the season with 1,709 rushing
yards on 330 rushing attempts, both second
all-time in Cardinal history.
Pro stock
Gaffney proved his ability to be a strong,
durable runner with his senior year perform
ance, consistently churning his legs to pick up
the extra few yards. Scouts worry about his
agility and breakaway speed in the NFL, how
ever, as his 5-foot-11,220-pound frame may
not be enough to consistently power through
bigger opponents in the NFL. -

Ben Gardner, DE
Drniar»+aH iinHrof+arl

Cardinal career
One of the defining Stanford players of his
generation, Gardner came to the Farm as a
two-star recruit but blossomed into much
more. Although his fifth season was cut short
by a torn pectoral injury suffered in the closing
moments in a win at Oregon State, the captain
was still named to the AII-Pac-12 first team
with 7.5 tackles and 4.5 sacks on the season.
Pro stock
After he was not invited to the NFL Combine,
Gardner exploded at Stanford's pro day with a
39.5-inch vertical jump and a 10-foot-2 broad
jump, numbers that would have placed him
second and fifth, respectively, among defen
sive ends at the combine. His strength and
athleticism alone should be enough to land
him a job, but he is likely a later round pick be
cause scouts are down on his ability to speed
rush from the edge.-
