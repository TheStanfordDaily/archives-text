# Artful Artifacts de Saisset captures symbolic culture
## 
### DEWITT CHENG 
In some current art discourse, reality and art, na
ture and culture, are assumed to be in opposition.
Some theorists go so far as denying that art can
represent life at all. This is simply restating, in ef
fect, the old cliche that art should be a complete,
accurate representation of reality that paint
ings should aspire to be photographs (or virtual reality).
Art is, of course, a symbolic and artful selection from
life not life itself. Three artists now on exhibit at
the de Saisset Museum at Santa Clara University
demonstrate the continuing power of the handmade
artifact updated with unorthodox, non-traditional ma
terials and contemporary working methods.
"New Passages" features the work of Mari An
drews and Ann Holsberry, longtime Emeryville studi
mates whose works, now together, evoke what curator
Lindsey Kouvaris labels the "metaphorical, philosophi
cal and personal" aspects of time and change. Andrews
collects natural and manufactured materials, which she
then assembles into low-relief wall sculptures that sug
gest obscure tools or ritual objects. If Andrews' works
manifest a pared-down elegance that derives from
Minimalism, the enigmatic allure of these generally
small, mysterious artifacts is considerable, partly due
to their odd combinations of materials steel, wire,
thorns, willow branches, stone, lead and mica and
partly due to the artist's ability to find ambiguously sug
gestive forms.
"Wire Stones" is composed of 26 nest-like wire
frame sculptures of stones; mounted to the wall in a
teardrop formation, they suggest depleted hollow
shells, or falling stars. "Curliwheel" is an irregular disk
woven from willow branches and bark. With its inter
stices filled by a layer of clear acrylic, its function is un
clear: tambourine, window, lens or wheel? The lead
circle of "Shielder" suggests radiation-protective
aprons, but its encrusted surface suggests excavation,
and its central cross or gun-scope crosshair connotes
danger. "Stonepaint" comprises an oval granite rock
rimmed with perforated metal strapping, which coils
around itself to form a spiral; tape reels come to mind,
as do eyeglasses or old-fashioned pince-nez spectacles.
Holsberry works in cyanotype, a kind of photo
graphic printmaking that yields a rich Prussian blue in
stead of black. Combining this with pastel, gouache (an
opaque watercolor paint) and wax, along with shells,
beads, bone, wax and collaged navigation charts, she
creates painterly, cosmic views into night skies that in
clude traces of human presence. "Taking Flight" de
picts a figure (the artist?) as seen from below, as in a
baroque ceiling fresco, releasing three white birds into
the sky. The two numbered versions of "Navigating by

Stars" present amorphous white entities that might be
clouds or galaxies set in deep space or deep water.
The large quilt-like piece, "Lido," suggests astronomi
cal charts that have been patched and revised sym
bolizing perhaps tribal wisdom, empirical and realistic,
not dogmatic.

Showing in an adjacent gallery are the shimmering
wall hangings by Mirang Wonne of San Francisco. Col
lectively entitled "Fire Script," the drawings reproduce
botanical forms tendrils and blossoms on sheets
of stainless steel wire mesh. Drawing her delicate in
terfacings on paper, and then tracing the contours with
a blowtorch on metal, the artist creates iridescent
shadings and subtle colorations that are particularly
striking when the screens are hung like banners, out
from the wall, as in "Capturing Moonlight," creating
an immersive environment.
