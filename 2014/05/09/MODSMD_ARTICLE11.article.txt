## COMEDY PARODIES TECHIE-FUZZY DIVIDE 
### SOPHIA DAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A thirst-quenching comedy
by Steve Martin, "Picasso
at the Lapin Agile" volleys
two geniuses of the 20th
century together in a bout
of creative genius. Direct
ed by Max Walker-Silverman and
presented by the young cast of
Stanford Theater Lab, the produc
tion shows May 8 - 10 at 8 p.m.

In the heart of Roble Dorm
Theater, you find a cozy Parisian
cabaret known as the Lapin Agile
decorated with an abundance of
aged books and paintings. Bartender
Freddy (Sebastian Sanchez-Luege
' 17) generously offers wine from the
well-stocked bar with his charming
French accent. Other special items
on the Lapin Agile's menu include
the Pu Pu Plateau, the Escar-van
gogh, and a personal favorite, the
Douche Baguette. The set itself
presents the level of hilarity and
mental tickling that soon ensues.

With the entrance of Gaston
(Nicholas Pether' 17) and none oth-

er than Albert Einstein (Austin
Caldwell' 15), we find ourselves sit
uated among men ruled by a desire
for artistic intelligence and recogni
tion, especially by the opposite sex.
Caldwell's quasi-German accent and
flushed-faced bewilderment never
cease to amuse onlookers of the
Lapin Agile farce as he flusters
through Einstein's groundbreaking
theory of relativity.
Germaine (Cecilia Lang-Ree
'l7) and Suzanne (Sarah Jobalia'
17) provide sources of female fi
nesse and persuasion. Both show
coy signs of desperation as they
seek love in the cabaret through
their simple blouses and colorful
trumpet-skirts.
The comedy takes a light philo

sophical look with the entrance of
haughty, yet endearing, art collec
tor Sagot (Ouree Lee 'l7) and has
tens with the second inspired pow
erhouse Pablo Picasso (Louis
McWilliams 'l6). McWilliams'
lanky gait and strong accent com
plete the image of Picasso as a hu
morous artist and womanizer. Wit
ness a fierce battle between Ein
stein and Picasso and in the mean
time gather a few pick-up lines
with the suave Picasso.

Possibly the most interesting
character of the night, Charles "Char
lene" DabernowSchmendiman (Em
ma Walker-Silverman 'l7) represents
the overly-enthusiastic start-up
founder as she injects incredible lev
els of near-psychotic oomph in
scenes of perfect confusion for all.
Her outfit complements her desire
for sophistication and genius.

The arrival of The Visitor
(Kevin Heller 'l6) allows for a dou
ble take as country-accented Heller
dons a leather jacket and blue
boots. Presumably Elvis Presley,
The Visitor ties together the differ
ent forms of inspiration within the
fuzzier Picasso and the techier Ein
stein. The production makes use of
fascinating lighting and sound to
show the moment of realization in
which both Einstein and Picasso
agree that the creative act is beau
tiful in of itself.

A short but highly engaging
show, "Picasso at the Lapin Agile"
represents not only 20th century
genius but also a microcosm of
Stanford in which fuzzy and techie
battle to take the foreground.
Ideas, miracles and filled glasses
will pass throughout the Lapin Ag
ile to offer a most entertaining
evening.
