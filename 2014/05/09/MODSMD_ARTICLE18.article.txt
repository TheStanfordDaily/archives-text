# GHRYST IS COMING
## Standout quarterback brings quiet leadership to the Farm 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
The newly renovated Vikings Stadium at Palo
Alto High School seats 2,348 people. Just
1,000 yards away head out through the
student parking lot, turn onto Churchill,
take care not to get run over by a car as you

cross El Camino Real Stanford Stadium holds
51,424 on a good day.
But a difference of 49,000 fans is just the tip of the
iceberg. At Stanford Stadium, the lights are brighter,
the burden heavier, the scrutiny tougher and the
stakes higher than they have ever been before.

When he arrives on The Farm
as a member of the Stanford foot
ball program for the first time this
summer, incoming freshman
Keller Chryst will have a tall task
ahead of him. Not only will he
have to live up to the lofty ex
pectations associated with being
one of the top quarterback
prospects in his class, it will
largely be the responsibility of
him and his recruiting class to
not only maintain the status quo
of success that has been built
within the program over the last
several years, but to bring the
program to new heights and con
tinue the upward trend of Stan
ford football to a College Foot
ball Playoff berth and be
yond.

Despite all of the hype that
has surrounded Chryst through
out his high school years and the
commitment process and his sta
tus as the heir apparent to the
Stanford quarterbacking post, he
has remained shrouded in a fair
amount of mystery to this point.
In their times at Stanford,
each of the Cardinal's recent
starting quarterbacks built a
legacy on The Farm. Tavita
Pritchard cemented his status in
Cardinal lore with the monu
mental upset of then-No. 1 USC
at the Coliseum in 2007. An
drew Luck was, well, Andrew
Luck, as he and his beloved
neckbeard took the nation by
storm and earned back-to-back
Heisman Trophy finalist honors
with berths in the Sun, Orange
and Fiesta bowls as the Cardinal
returned to national promi
nence. Josh Nunes set the stage
for the Cardinal's Pac-12 Cham
pionship and Rose Bowl berth in
2012 and Kevin Hogan finished
what Nunes started by toppling
Oregon twice and leading the
team to a pair of conference titles
and Rose Bowl appearances.
So in looking ahead to Chrys
t's future among that line of no
table Stanford quarterbacks, the

question arises: Who exactly is
Keller Chryst, and how did he get
here?

When your father is an NFL
coach, it's almost impossible to
grow up as a little boy without
football being a significant part of
your upbringing. For Chryst,
however, the familial ties to the
game of football go much, much
deeper than that.
His grandfather, George
Chryst, was the patriarch of
Chryst males' involvement in
football as a profession, as he
served for 30 years as the athletic
director and head football coach

starting in 1979 at the University
of Wisconsin-Platteville. Follow
ing George's lead, football essen
tially became the family business
for the Chryst clan.
George's three sons
Geep, Paul and Rick have all
been involved in football for their
entire lives, with all three playing
collegiate football before parting
ways and all taking on prominent
roles within both the NFL and
the NCAA. Geep, Keller's father,
is the current quarterbacks coach
for the San Francisco 49ers after
having earned various coaching
positions all around the league,
while Paul is the head coach at

the University of Pittsburgh and
Rick served as commissioner of
the Mid-American Conference
until 2009.

While Geep's coaching expe
rience has paid dividends in the
development of Keller's football
career by exposing him to differ
ent professional athletes and fa
cilities around the nation, the ex
tent to which Geep as a coach
has shaped Keller's football expe
rience has largely stopped there.
"It's not as much [of a con
flict between the coach and fa
ther identities] as many people
think," Chryst said. "Lots of peo
ple think he's giving me informa
tion the whole time, that he's
feeding me in the whole time,
but he's around as more of a dad
than he is as a coach."

"He keeps that separate
probably better than most,"
added Palo Alto head coach and
athletic director Earl Hansen.
"He's a family man when he's at
home; he's a coach when he's
with the 49ers."

While the advantages that
arise from Geep's position are
certainly there, it has also been a
disadvantage for Keller; the ne
cessity for the family to relocate
with Geep's every coaching
change meant that Keller was un
able to settle down anywhere he
has lived for any significant
amount of time.

Since 1996, Geep has been
employed by the Arizona Cardi
nals, the San Diego Chargers, the
Cardinals again, the Carolina Pan
thers and the San Francisco
49ers. Not only have those many
moves made Keller self-pro
claimed introvert and "quiet
guy," but they have also forced
him to adapt to many different
styles of play within several dif
ferent coaching styles throughout
his football upbringing.
"My junior year in high
school was the first year since
fourth grade in playing football
that I'd ever run the same of
fense back to back," Keller said.
"So I've been constantly adapt
ing, getting new friends, building
new teammates and stuff like
that, too, so I'm kind of used to
change and it's just something I
have to live with."

"[lt's helped with] just being
able to adapt on the field depend
ing on where the defense is
lined, or specific coverage or a
specific formation, too," Keller
added. "Just being able to adapt
to in-game situations."
Before he started playing
quarterback in eighth and ninth
grade, Keller had played almost
every position on the football
field: safety, nose guard, tight
end, receiver, running back.
("Pretty much everything but the
offensive line," he said with a
grin.) But despite his relative in
experience at quarterback when
he first started, Keller's incredi
ble work ethic sped his develop
ment. Not only did he take advan
tage of that on the football field;
he also took that to heart in his

"I'm kind of used to change
and it's just something I
have to live with."

Highly touted quarterback recruit Keller Chryst (center) has spent the last three seasons across the street
from Stanford at Palo Alto High School after an upbringing that was characterized by constant change.
everyday life, to the point where
a quiet but fierce intensity gov
erns everything Keller does.
"He has a lot of natural abili
ty, but it all stems from the fact
that he works at it," Hansen said.
"He works to be good. He comes
in to lift every day. He studies
film, makes sure to keep up on

our opponents. He checks up, he
self-evaluates."
"I feel like if I'm wasting
time doing something, I'm kind
of OCD, so I feel like I should be
doing something to make myself
better," Keller said.
When he moved from North
Carolina to the Bay Area before

son and became the starting
quarterback for the Vikings,
Keller's intense drive, his natural
physical prowess and his football
instincts immediately put him on
the radar as one of the standout
high school quarterbacks in the
country.

During his sophomore year,
his first season starting at quar
terback for the Vikings, Keller
threw for 2,165 yards and 28
touchdowns as he led the team to
an 8-2 regular season. Despite
the gaudy numbers, however,
Keller thought he struggled that
year, particularly in a 20-6 win

against Leland in the first round
of the playoffs.
In that game, Chryst shoul
dered the burden of returning
the Vikings to relevance after a
deep run in the state tournament
the year before. And a terrible

first half one in which he
threw four interceptions and
the Vikings were shut out as a
result put those goals into
doubt.

"I was a sophomore, and
I'd just moved here, and the
team had just come off state,"
Chryst said. "I felt like I'd let
everyone down, and I just had
to pull that aside and focus on
what was in front of me ... I
thought to myself, 'lt's over.
You've got a whole half to
play. You're only down six.'"
The mental solidarity cer
tainly helped Chryst through
the rest of the game, as he
connected on two touchdown
passes to come from behind
and pull out a victory that not
only propelled the team into
the next round of the play
offs, but also consolidated
Keller's status at the helm of
the team.

After that, Chryst didn't
look back. Through the next
two years, he would build on
that experience as he went on
to be one of the most talented
quarterbacks that Palo Alto
High School had ever seen,
finishing his career with
7,326 passing yards and 84
touchdowns.

Although his standout
performance caught the eye
of many football powerhouse
programs around the nation
when the time came to
choose a school, Chryst main
tained that the decision to
choose Stanford was an easy
one although he did give a
"fair shot" to USC and Ala
bama, as well.
"He didn't really crave
[the attention]," Hansen said.
"He didn't go on all of his re
cruiting trips. He knew where
he wanted to go. He made his
decision, signed with Stan
ford."

♦ ♦♦
At Stanford, the memo
ry of Andrew Luck still re

mains fresh.
Cardinal fans won't easily
forget the image of the quar
terback finding a hole in the
line and exploiting it with his
powerful legs and frame to
bowl over defenders in order
to pick up extra yardage.
Cardinal fans won't easily
forget the image of the quar
terback launching improbably
accurate throws to receivers
as if they had been fired from
a cannon.

Cardinal fans won't easily
forget the image of the quar
terback that had the combina
tion of raw instinct for the
game and football knowledge
that took him over the edge
seemingly always knowing
where the open receiver was
or where his offense matched
up favorably against the de
fensive alignment.
Maybe Cardinal fans
won't have the chance to for
get, anyway.

One of the most striking
comparisons that Chryst has
drawn as of late is to the for
mer Stanford quarterback,
now leading the Indianapolis
Colts on Sundays. That simi
larity has many Cardinal fans
cautiously optimistic about
the development of the in
coming freshman through his
Stanford career.
"He's one of the most ac
curate deep throwers I've
ever had," Hansen said. "It's
not just the strength. I've had
a lot of guys that can throw
the ball 60 yards, but they
don't know where it's going.
Keller can put it right where
he wants to."
That arm strength,

"He knew where he wanted
to go. He made his decision,
signed with Stanford"


SCOTT ANDREWS/The Paly Voice
After a relatively easy decision, Chryst (right) signed his letter of intent to attend Stanford for his
collegiate education and playing career. He was part of a strong 2014 recruiting class that was
ranked by ESPN as the 15th-strongest in the nation and second in the Pac- 12 behind only USC.
Chryst's main calling card, has helped him
thrive in the pocket-passing-heavy, West
Coast offense that the more traditional
Hansen runs at Palo Alto. However, de
spite the fact that designed quarterback
runs don't really have a significant niche in
such an offensive system, another of the
factors that has differentiated Chryst from
the pocket-passers in his class has been his
mobility under pressure, which allows to
pick up yardage and keep plays alive for his
receivers to get open.

That mobility is due to both his natu
ral athletic ability and his large frame; he
stands at 6-foot-4 and 230 pounds, eerily
reminiscent of Luck's 6-foot-4, 234-pound
body.

"I'm obviously not going to break an
80-yard touchdown run like Johnny

Manziel," Chryst said with a laugh. "But
I'll make a few plays with my feet once in
a while, just being in the West Coast sys
tem, where there's so many options and
you take what the defense gives you."
However, while being able to scram
ble and take on second-level defenders in
high school is one thing, doing the same in
a primetime conference like the Pac-12
represents a much more advanced chal
lenge. While Chryst has the physical abili
ties to adjust to the new level of competi
tion, mastering the mental element of the
game and catching up to the speed of col
lege defenders that will present difficulty.
That said, Hansen believes Chryst is more
than prepared for that challenge.
"He's going to have to get used to that
speed," said the coach. "I don't believe

that's going to be an issue. He's not going
to go over there and be overwhelmed be
cause they're so big."

With the elevation of the level of the
game comes a mental adjustment that
needs to be made as well. In high school,
Chryst was able to rely on his superior
physical prowess to make plays even in the
most difficult of situations, but that physi
cal advantage will not be as pronounced at
the collegiate level. Because of that, he
will need to accept the idea that he won't
always be able to make something happen.
"He's not a finished product yet,"
Hansen said. "He has to understand the
situations much better and try not to make
a play every play. That's what he did in
high school, and he was head and shoul
ders better than anybody in our league,

but he thought that he could make a play
every play and it's not realistic. Sometimes
you have to fold."
At Stanford, where he will almost cer
tainly redshirt his freshman season while
Hogan starts for a third straight year, there
will be plenty of time to develop that ma
turity and turn a diamond in the rough in
to a gem.

And that gem certainly has the poten
tial to twinkle in the limelight.
"I just feel that Keller fits with An
drew Luck a lot," said KeeSean Johnson,
Chryst's leading wide receiver at Palo Alto.
"Luck might be able to run a little faster
than Keller, but when Keller needs to
make a big play on his feet, he can. And
the passing game once he gets to that
level, he might be a little better at the
passing level than Luck."
When asked about the comparison of
his skillset to any NFL quarterback, Chryst
chuckled.

"I'm not going to say Luck," he said
immediately. "If I get my running game up
a little bit better I could become more like
Andrew Luck, but I see myself in between
Andrew Luck and Peyton Manning."
Even with the comparisons to Stan
ford fans' favorite quarterback, Chryst is
quick to maintain the humility that has de
fined his character throughout his career.
"I'm just a regular class of 2014 guy
coming in; a true freshman coming in just
like the other guys," he said. "I've got to
work hard and I've just got to pay my
dues."

Making the mental, physical and emotion
al adjustments to college is an enormous
hurdle for any football player. But for
Chryst, that transition will mean more
than just adjusting to the bigger and faster
college game and learning how to handle
the media.

In order for Chryst to be successful,
he will have to complete the process of
emerging from his shell and fully taking on
the personality of a leader, both on and off
the field. At the college and professional
levels, being a quarterback isn't just about
making the throws and putting up points.
It's also about becoming the focal point of
the team and being a leader in the huddle

and his teammates congregate in the center of the field. Chryst threw for 181 yards and two touchdowns in the victory.
and on the sidelines.
Put simply, Chryst will have to over
come his natural introversion.
"I'm kind of a quiet guy," Chryst said
with a smile. "When I first started playing
quarterback... I was kind of quiet and
didn't really want to boss people around,
be a leader and express myself."
That quietness didn't go unnoticed by
his new coach and teammates at Palo Alto
High. At first, Chryst's quiet off-the-field
demeanor was also reflected in his more re
served direction of the offense. However,
as Chryst quickly learned about the de
manding leadership requirements of the
quarterback job, he strived to become a
more vocal presence on the offense and to
open up to his teammates as well. As his
bonds with his new friends and his comfort
with the environment and expectations
grew, so did his intensity on the field.
"When he first came here, Keller was
really quiet, not talking a lot," Johnson
said. "And then he finally opened up. He
started cracking jokes with us and being
funny. And then on the field, there's a to
tally different Keller. As soon as we hit the
field, there's no fun and games. It's all se
riousness."

"That's probably one of the things
over the last three years that he's really im
proved on: his leadership," Hansen added.
But as far as he has come in that regard,
Chryst, a self-described perfectionist,
knows that the work that he has done in
high school is just the basis for a bigger tran
sition that he needs to make into leading at
the collegiate level and maybe beyond.
In terms of knowing what is required
of him at the collegiate level, Chryst has a
leg up on his competition due to the vari
ous opportunities afforded to him in high
school. Chryst worked out at the training
camps of both the Carolina Panthers and
San Francisco 49ers when his father
worked for each of the franchises. In addi
tion, he was able to interact with many
talented collegiate quarterbacks in
cluding Tajh Boyd of Clemson, Johnny
Manziel of Texas A&M and David Fales of
San Jose State at the Elite 11 finals at
The Opening in Portland, Oregon last
summer. By interacting with quarterbacks
that have already experienced the chal
lenges that he will face as a collegiate
leader, Chryst feels that he already has a

good idea of what he will need to do in or
der to succeed.

"I'm going to be a young guy; I'm go
ing to have to be talking in the huddle to
older guys," Chryst said. "I hate to say it,
but even if you don't know what you're
doing, you need to look like you do know
what you're doing, and you've got to have
command of the huddle. You've got to
have sternness and authority."

As he transitions from his comfort
zone to yet another new situation, howev
er, Chryst is more confident and experi
enced after all of the progress that he has
made in the last three years at Palo Alto.
He has already begun to interact with his
new teammates at Stanford in away that

the Keller Chryst of three years ago would
likely not have been able to. In doing so,
he is building a solid foundation on which
he can realize his fullest leadership poten
tial on a new stage at Stanford.
"When I met the incoming [class of]
2014 guys in January, I think I really
clicked with them and I kind of got out of
my introvert-type self," Chryst said. "I felt
like we're so like-minded in everything we
do that it was easy."
And if he is able to fully gel with his
teammates at Stanford and develop the
full leadership mindset to complement his
extraordinary physical talent, there's no
telling how far Keller Chryst could go.
"I believe that Keller can end up going

all the way [to the NFL]," Johnson said. "As
far as you would want to with a football ca
reer."
For a stellar leader on the field, it
doesn't matter how bright the lights shine,
how heavy the burden is, how tough the
scrutiny is or how high the stakes are. It
doesn't matter whether there are 2,348
fans or 51,424. Because for a leader, the
only things that matter are the 10 other
people taking the field and his ability to
spearhead their collective pursuit for per
fection. And Keller Chryst is no stranger to
pursuing perfection.
