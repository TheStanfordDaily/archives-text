# Bidding the Class of 2009 a fond farewell
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
Another year, another draft and an
other class of Cardinal football
players to say goodbye to. This
time last year and the year before,
we said goodbye to members of
Stanford's former recruiting class of 2008: a
heralded group that included David DeCastro,
Jonathan Martin, Chris Owusu, Chase Thomas
and, of course, Andrew Luck. Now it's time to
bid adieu to the fifth-year seniors from the for
mer recruiting class of 2009: Shayne Skov, Ben
Gardner, Ryan Hewitt, Tyler Gaffney, Trent
Murphy and a handful of others.

That 'OB class will
probably be remem
bered as the best in
Cardinal history. But
the one that followed
it accomplished even
more five straight
bowls, four straight
BCS appearances and

two straight Rose Bowls and did just as
much to build the success of this era of Stan
ford football as its predecessor did.
For me, this class will be even harder to
say goodbye to. This group was so special be
cause of the stories of each of its members
during their time on the Farm.
Of course, that's true to some extent
each and every year, but for all of its greatness
and all of its personalities, the class of 2008
was short on narratives. Luck came in as the
savior of Stanford football and lived up to his
reputation. DeCastro and Martin earned start
ing jobs early in their careers and dominated
game after game. Guys like Alex Debniak and
Sam Schwartzstein certainly do have amazing
stories to tell, but Stanford's top 2008 re
cruits, at least, will be remembered because
of how well they did their jobs not how
they got there.

That's not the case for the future
NFLers in the Card's 2009 class.

turned sidelined junior. What looked like an
easy ascent to the helm of the Cardinal de
fense was derailed in an instant, but Skov
