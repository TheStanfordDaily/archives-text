# Bidding the Class of 2009 a fond farewell
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
Another year, another draft and an
other class of Cardinal football
players to say goodbye to. This
time last year and the year before,
we said goodbye to members of
Stanford's former recruiting class of 2008: a
heralded group that included David DeCastro,
Jonathan Martin, Chris Owusu, Chase Thomas
and, of course, Andrew Luck. Now it's time to
bid adieu to the fifth-year seniors from the for
mer recruiting class of 2009: Shayne Skov, Ben
Gardner, Ryan Hewitt, Tyler Gaffney, Trent
Murphy and a handful of others.

That 'OB class will
probably be remem
bered as the best in
Cardinal history. But
the one that followed
it accomplished even
more five straight
bowls, four straight
BCS appearances and

two straight Rose Bowls and did just as
much to build the success of this era of Stan
ford football as its predecessor did.
For me, this class will be even harder to
say goodbye to. This group was so special be
cause of the stories of each of its members
during their time on the Farm.
Of course, that's true to some extent
each and every year, but for all of its greatness
and all of its personalities, the class of 2008
was short on narratives. Luck came in as the
savior of Stanford football and lived up to his
reputation. DeCastro and Martin earned start
ing jobs early in their careers and dominated
game after game. Guys like Alex Debniak and
Sam Schwartzstein certainly do have amazing
stories to tell, but Stanford's top 2008 re
cruits, at least, will be remembered because
of how well they did their jobs not how
they got there.

That's not the case for the future
NFLers in the Card's 2009 class.

There's Skov, the sophomore stud
turned sidelined junior. What looked like an
easy ascent to the helm of the Cardinal de
fense was derailed in an instant, but Skov

battled back, once again becoming the mo
hawked, eyeblacked leader Stanford needed
both on the field and in the locker room.

There's Gaffney, the guy who realized
he loved baseball more until he realized he
loved football more. And even after a year
split between minor league buses and the
outfield grass, Gaffney returned with the
second-best rushing season in Stanford his
tory, not to mention a 45-carry night against
Oregon.

There's Gardner, the two-star recruit
who didn't even get a major-college offer un
til Jack Harbaugh (Jim's dad) stumbled on his
film. Murphy, Stanford's meanest player on

the football field just ask any Pac-12 quar
terback and its nicest off it. Jarek Lancast
er, who went from team-leading tackier to
backup and special teams player over the
course of a single offseason, but still didn't
flinch.

At least in this age of Cardinal football,
there will never be another class that signed
on with a losing team. There will never be
another class had to overcome quite this
much; there will never be another class with
as good of a story to tell.

Even the despair Joseph Beyda felt in the pit
of his stomach when the Browns scooped up
Johnny Manziel last night doesn't match the
emotion he feels about Stanford's outgoing
players. Send your favorite memories of the
