## Expanding Campus Stanford plans for new satellite campus in Redwood City 
### DANNY GIFFORD STAFF WRITER 
In 2008, Stanford ap
proached Redwood City with a
prospective economic transac
tion: The University was look
ing to expand past the Farm,
developing plans for a nearby
"satellite campus," and Red
wood City had a 35-acre chunk
of prime real estate available
next to Highway 101, just sev
en miles northwest of the
Stanford campus.

In exchange for rights to
the land, the University would
provide Redwood City with a
handsome financial reward. It
seemed like an obvious deci
sion for a town that, according
to Council Member Barbara
Pierce, "never quite has
enough [money] to do what
we want to do."

But Vice Mayor Rosanne
Foust and then-Mayor Jeff Ira,
who served together on the
council subcommittee dealing
with the project, felt that they
could gain more from the Uni
versity than monetary com
pensation. They wanted Stan
ford's presence to permeate
the community and leave a
lasting impression on not just
the city's bottom line, but its
average citizen as well.
"We wanted something
that was legacy-building,"

Foust said.
By the time the deal was
finalized over five years later
with the Redwood City
Council unanimously approv
ing the project on Sept. 9,
2013 the seeds of that
legacy had been planted. The
city will still receive the tradi
tional fiscal incentives in
cluding $ 1.5 million for street
repairs, $1 million for storm
protection upgrades and $1.5
million for water tank improve
ments but $5 million will be
allocated specifically to forming
a bond between the city of
79,000 and the University.
Over the next five years,
the Graduate School of Busi
ness (GSB) will provide a host
of educational, development
focused opportunities for the
city and its residents, ranging
from a multi-year speaker se
ries at the Fox Theatre to a
three-module "entrepreneur
ship boot camp" this summer.
The speaker series kicked
off earlier this month when
women's basketball coach Tara
VanDerveer, Tesla Motors co
founder Jeffrey Brian Straubel
'9B M.S. 'OO and Khan Acade
my Director of Partnerships
James Tynan each delivered a
15-minute TED-style talk to a
crowd of Redwood City citizens.
