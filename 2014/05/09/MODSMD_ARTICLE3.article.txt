# Lathrop Library to replace Meyer
## 
### ZACH SORENSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Lathrop Library is currently
being renovated to replace Mey
er Library, which will be closed
for the 2014-15 academic year
and is scheduled to be demol
ished the following summer.
The new facility will be lo
cated in the former Graduate
School of Business (GSB) South
Building, adjacent to Memorial
Auditorium. Renovations on the
building began last summer and
are scheduled for completion
this quarter. The new library is
named after Jane Lathrop Stan
ford, the co-founder of the Uni
versity who also donated her
jewelry collection to establish
Stanford's first library book fund.
All of the services currently
available at Meyer will be moved
to the new space, including the

24-hour study room, the Tech
Desk, the Digital Language Lab
and large format printing equip
ment. Featuring more outdoor
spaces and natural light, a new
cafe and a contemporary interior
design, the new library will also
house group study spaces and
new classrooms managed by the
Office of the University Registrar
and the Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education.

Although the new location
is farther away from Green li
brary and most undergraduate
residential areas, library staff
members are optimistic that li
brary usage will not be affected.
"If you look at where Lath
rop is, it's actually still really con
venient," said Gabrielle Karam
pelas, director of communica
tions for Stanford University Li-

braries. "In fact, it has better parking access, better
bike parking access and the Marguerite drops off a lit
tle closer."

The decision to raze Meyer and move its services
to another location was announced in 2007 after a
seismic safety evaluation found that costs of bringing
Meyer into compliance with current standards would
exceed $45 million. Renovating the GSB South Build
ing into a new library proved to be a more cost-effec
tive decision.

Although there have been rumors of Meyer's lot
being left as an undeveloped grassy area, plans for the
space occupied by Meyer have not been finalized, ac
cording to Karampelas.

Movement of the East Asia library
Lathrop library will also include an expanded
home for the East Asia library, which contains over
680,000 volumes in the social sciences and humani
ties related to the Chinese, Japanese and Korean lan
guages.

"People in East Asian Studies are very happy with
the decision [to not split the collection]," said Gordon
Chang '72 Ph.D. 'B7, director of the Center for East
Asian Studies and member of the Committee on li
braries, a subcommittee of the Faculty Senate.
Chang praised the location of the East Asia li
brary, noting that the Center for East Asian Studies and
the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures
are both located adjacent to Lathrop Library in the
Knight Building.

"The new library is going to make a hub for East
Asian Studies," Chang said. "It's very accessible, and
there is a lot more usable space."
"Currently, we have more than a hundred Asian
Studies faculty and researchers on campus. It's the

biggest international studies area," said Qi Qiu, assis
tant head of the East Asia library. "This new library is
definitely going to be an attraction to potential stu
dents, faculty and visiting scholars."
According to Jidong Yang, head of the East Asia
Library, Lathrop's larger size and improved accessibil
ity will allow for more events, exhibits and classes.
Yang is also hopeful that the new space will improve
the East Asia Library's ability to attract potential
donors.

"We are going to have a brand new special col
lections for the East Asia Library, which will hold a
number of very precious materials," Yang said. "And,
of course, we are planning to develop the collection ag
gressively in future years. As a matter of fact, Stanford's
East Asia Library already has a bigger budget than
Berkeley's East Asia Library for collection development
if this continues, our collection will be bigger than
Berkeley's in about 10 years."
The transition
The transition to Lathrop Library —to be com
pleted in phases—will begin as soon as renovations
on the new building are complete. The new library is
scheduled to open before the beginning of fall quarter.
"We're trying to keep the services open for sum
mer, though there might be a one-week period where
they won't be accessible," Karampelas said.
Although transition plans are nearly solidified, li
brary staff members are still figuring out how to move
one key feature of Meyer.

"Everyone is asking about the 'Beat Cal' banner,"
Karampelas said. "We're making sure we can still dis
play that."

braries. "In fact, it has better parking access, better
bike parking access and the Marguerite drops off a lit
tle closer."

The decision to raze Meyer and move its services
to another location was announced in 2007 after a
seismic safety evaluation found that costs of bringing
Meyer into compliance with current standards would
exceed $45 million. Renovating the GSB South Build
ing into a new library proved to be a more cost-effec
tive decision.

Although there have been rumors of Meyer's lot
being left as an undeveloped grassy area, plans for the
space occupied by Meyer have not been finalized, ac
cording to Karampelas.

Movement of the East Asia library
Lathrop library will also include an expanded
home for the East Asia library, which contains over
680,000 volumes in the social sciences and humani
ties related to the Chinese, Japanese and Korean lan
guages.

"People in East Asian Studies are very happy with
the decision [to not split the collection]," said Gordon
Chang '72 Ph.D. 'B7, director of the Center for East
Asian Studies and member of the Committee on li
braries, a subcommittee of the Faculty Senate.
Chang praised the location of the East Asia li
brary, noting that the Center for East Asian Studies and
the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures
are both located adjacent to Lathrop Library in the
Knight Building.

"The new library is going to make a hub for East
Asian Studies," Chang said. "It's very accessible, and
there is a lot more usable space."
"Currently, we have more than a hundred Asian
Studies faculty and researchers on campus. It's the

biggest international studies area," said Qi Qiu, assis
tant head of the East Asia library. "This new library is
definitely going to be an attraction to potential stu
dents, faculty and visiting scholars."
According to Jidong Yang, head of the East Asia
Library, Lathrop's larger size and improved accessibil
ity will allow for more events, exhibits and classes.
Yang is also hopeful that the new space will improve
the East Asia Library's ability to attract potential
donors.

"We are going to have a brand new special col
lections for the East Asia Library, which will hold a
number of very precious materials," Yang said. "And,
of course, we are planning to develop the collection ag
gressively in future years. As a matter of fact, Stanford's
East Asia Library already has a bigger budget than
Berkeley's East Asia Library for collection development
if this continues, our collection will be bigger than
Berkeley's in about 10 years."
The transition
The transition to Lathrop Library —to be com
pleted in phases—will begin as soon as renovations
on the new building are complete. The new library is
scheduled to open before the beginning of fall quarter.
"We're trying to keep the services open for sum
mer, though there might be a one-week period where
they won't be accessible," Karampelas said.
Although transition plans are nearly solidified, li
brary staff members are still figuring out how to move
one key feature of Meyer.

"Everyone is asking about the 'Beat Cal' banner,"
Karampelas said. "We're making sure we can still dis
play that."

The new 35-acre Redwood City satellite campus, as referred to in the "Expanding
Campus" story on page 2, is 17 miles northwest of the main Stanford campus and just
off Highway 101. The campus will house Stanford Medical Center outpatient clinics.
Lathrop Library is currently
being renovated to replace Mey
er Library, which will be closed
for the 2014-15 academic year
and is scheduled to be demol
ished the following summer.
The new facility will be lo
cated in the former Graduate
School of Business (GSB) South
Building, adjacent to Memorial
Auditorium. Renovations on the
building began last summer and
are scheduled for completion
this quarter. The new library is
named after Jane Lathrop Stan
ford, the co-founder of the Uni
versity who also donated her
jewelry collection to establish
Stanford's first library book fund.
All of the services currently
available at Meyer will be moved
to the new space, including the

24-hour study room, the Tech
Desk, the Digital Language Lab
and large format printing equip
ment. Featuring more outdoor
spaces and natural light, a new
cafe and a contemporary interior
design, the new library will also
house group study spaces and
new classrooms managed by the
Office of the University Registrar
and the Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education.
