### ZACH SORENSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Lathrop Library is currently
being renovated to replace Mey
er Library, which will be closed
for the 2014-15 academic year
and is scheduled to be demol
ished the following summer.
The new facility will be lo
cated in the former Graduate
School of Business (GSB) South
Building, adjacent to Memorial
Auditorium. Renovations on the
building began last summer and
are scheduled for completion
this quarter. The new library is
named after Jane Lathrop Stan
ford, the co-founder of the Uni
versity who also donated her
jewelry collection to establish
Stanford's first library book fund.
All of the services currently
available at Meyer will be moved
to the new space, including the

24-hour study room, the Tech
Desk, the Digital Language Lab
and large format printing equip
ment. Featuring more outdoor
spaces and natural light, a new
cafe and a contemporary interior
design, the new library will also
house group study spaces and
new classrooms managed by the
Office of the University Registrar
and the Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education.

Although the new location
is farther away from Green li
brary and most undergraduate
residential areas, library staff
members are optimistic that li
brary usage will not be affected.
"If you look at where Lath
rop is, it's actually still really con
venient," said Gabrielle Karam
pelas, director of communica
tions for Stanford University Li-

Meyer Library is set to be demolished by 2015. Its services
