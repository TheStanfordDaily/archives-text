# Renovations address increasing population
## 
### NITISH KULKARNI DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Housing and Parking at Stanford,
especially for non-student community
members, has been criticized as inad
equate and in need of a drastic exten
sion. In response, the University is
combating the lack of housing and
parking with a large number of proj
ects to increase parking spaces and
on-campus housing for graduate stu
dents, faculty members and com
muters. These projects include new
housing for first-year MBA students at
the Graduate School of Business
(GSB), a multi-level underground lot
beneath Roble Field and new faculty
housing on California Avenue.

GSB student housing
Undergraduates are not alone in
the lack of adequate housing space, as
first-year MBA students face similar
housing issues. The Graduate School
of Business approved the construction
of a new residential complex this Janu
ary. The buildingwill be next to Schwab
Residential Center.

• The building will be a 1,400-square
foot complex and will have a similar
arrangement to the Schwab Resi
dential Center —with buildings
centered around a courtyard.
• Units will have two bathrooms, two
bedrooms and a shared kitchen.
• They will be larger than the rooms
in the Schwab.
• The building aims to have 200
more beds than Schwab.
• Construction begins late 2014 and
projected to finish summer 2016.
Parking space under Roble field
Stanford has made efforts over
the year to improve the parking situa
tion for community members and
commuters. In February, the Board of
Trustees preliminarily approved the
construction of a new parking garage
underneath Roble field.

• The new garage will be built be
tween the Arrillaga Outdoor Educa
tion and Recreation Center and
Roble Gym.
• The structure will span four levels
and provide 1,006 parking spaces.
• The project opens January 2016.
• The project costs a total $42 million
to build and open.

New off-campus faculty housing
Stanford faculty housing has
historically been around Mayfield
Avenue, in the area separating Cam
pus Drive and Page Mill Road. How
ever, housing in this area is hard to
come by, due to high demand and
low supply of houses that are avail
able for rent or purchase. In an ef
fort to combat this problem, the
Board of Trustees approved the Cali
fornia Avenue Faculty Homes Proj
ect on February.

• The California Avenue Faculty
Homes Project will provide 180
new residences for faculty.
• The project will be built in a 17-acre
complex, with houses interspersed
around the central park, and two
four-story condominium buildings
in the back towards Page Mill Road.
• Sixty-eight single-family homes will
be built. These houses will vary in
size from 1,700 to 2,700 square
feet. Larger homes will have back
yards and smaller homes will have
side patios similar to those on the
Olmstead Terrace.
• The project also includes 112 con
dominiums, which will range in size
from 1,805 to 1,600 square feet.
• With a total cost of $ 155 million
a 21 percent increase over the orig
inal estimate of $ 128 million the
project will also include a lap pool,
an acre of open space, a fitness cen
ter and a community center.
• The housing project is expected to
be finished by late 2017.
