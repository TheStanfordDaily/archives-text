# OPINIONS
## Op-Ed Oak Creek is the real deal 
### 
Ke beginning of autumn quarter or, more likely, the quarter
your study abroad quarter. Your friend asks, "Where are you
this year?" for the second or third time this week. You let
out a tiny sigh as you brace for the inevitably overblown reaction af
ter you respond, "Oak Creek."
Laughter, sympathy, consolation and your friend's relief that he
or she was not in your situation ensue —independently, collective
ly or perhaps even consecutively. You will probably try to create mu
tually agreed arrangements to camp out at your friend's place dur
ing the weekends, which will never take place. If that is not an op
tion, you desperately try to change the subject of the conversation or

pretend you have a class to save yourself from your misery.
But like any scenario in life, there is an even better option: suck
it up and look at the bright side. Whether you are the nerdiest of
FroSoCo nerds or a fiat boy socialite, Oak Creek is nothing short of
paradise if you let it be.
First off, Oak Creek has amenities galore. You have a barely used
gym steps away. A pool to cool a lover and yourself from the heat of
the night. A hot tub to read your favorite book in. Tennis courts. Plen
tiful green grass. BBQ grills. A beautiful and comfortable lounge with
never-ending beverages and sometimes chocolate chip cookies!
There's even a walking trail. If you squint your eyes and keep your
head pointed in one direction, you can even trick yourself into
thinking you are in a magical redwood forest. And at the end of the
day, you can treat yourself to an effing sauna session!
In your room, the amenities continue. Full kitchen with an
oven, stove, freezer, refrigerator and microwave. A dining room. A
living room. Single rooms and a good chance that your one-room
double will turn into a single due to study abroad or petitioning. A
private bathroom. Private closets. And a balcony.
Oak Creek is more of a resort than an apartment complex.
Renters actually pay around $20,000 to $40,000 to live here. Still,
eventually your glee over the amenities will fade and you will hope
fully find value in Oak Creek's less tangible benefits.
You will be able to ride your bike. To get to class, it takes 10
minutes by cycling. You can also drive, but most of the time, driving
is actually slower. Moreover, you can score up to $3OO from Stan
ford Parking and Transportation Services' commuter program by
not registering for a parking permit. (Note: Even without a permit,
you can still use your car to drive to campus on weekends and after
4 p.m. on weekdays.)
Cycling has secondary benefits. It's obviously a good workout.
In addition, because going back and forth to your room is a bit of a
journey, you are more inclined to stay on campus and get work
done. When I lived in Crothers last year, I found myself sneaking in
a nap in between classes even though I already had eight hours
of sleep the night before. Weekends used to be catching up days for
me, but now, it's always a hiking trip, a concert or maybe a trip to
LA. Even when my winter quarter was masochistically brutal (due
to Dental Admissions Test studying), most of my winter quarter
weekends were still trip days for me. The beauty of Oak Creek is
that you have the power to make it more isolated than the frozen
world of Hoth during weekdays and a classy party place during the
weekends. If you want a GPA booster as well as a living space that

can host legit dinners and parties, draw Oak Creek.
Depending on your situation, you may also be adding cooking
skills to your repertoire. Do be aware that cooking for yourself on a
daily basis is economically unfeasible. It works best when you coor
dinate with your fellow roommates. That being said, I frequently
make pizzas for myself and I have perfected a couple of my fa
vorite dishes. Also, at the beginning and end of the quarter, Edith
Wu-Nguyen '99 and John Wu '95 MBA 'OO the two nicest
RFs on campus and their very cute toddler Elly usually host
brunch and a first-come, first-served farmer's market. You can re
quest grocery items ranging from toilet paper to spinach. They'll
buy it and you can put it in your bag, free of charge! Other options
include standard meal plans as well as a five-meal-per-week apart
ment meal plan. Another quick pro-tip: Sharpen your soliciting
skills.
Now, Oak Creek definitely has its shortcomings... or does it?
Only your best friends will be willing to make the trek up there reg

ularly, and when they are willing, you will have to spend an unrea
sonable amount of time giving directions. So most times, you will
be visiting others. This was especially the case for me and I noticed
that despite living in Oak Creek, I was visiting friends or going to
campus events nearly every day. After this year, I will never forget
how meaningful a simple visit to a friend's place can be. In many
ways, living further away from campus made me closer to this
school.

you can still use your car to drive to campus on weekends and after

Cycling has secondary benefits. It's obviously a good workout.
In addition, because going back and forth to your room is a bit of a
journey, you are more inclined to stay on campus and get work
done. When I lived in Crothers last year, I found myself sneaking in
a nap in between classes even though I already had eight hours
of sleep the night before. Weekends used to be catching up days for
me, but now, it's always a hiking trip, a concert or maybe a trip to
LA. Even when my winter quarter was masochistically brutal (due
to Dental Admissions Test studying), most of my winter quarter
weekends were still trip days for me. The beauty of Oak Creek is
that you have the power to make it more isolated than the frozen
world of Hoth during weekdays and a classy party place during the
weekends. If you want a GPA booster as well as a living space that

can host legit dinners and parties, draw Oak Creek.
Depending on your situation, you may also be adding cooking
skills to your repertoire. Do be aware that cooking for yourself on a
daily basis is economically unfeasible. It works best when you coor
dinate with your fellow roommates. That being said, I frequently
make pizzas for myself and I have perfected a couple of my fa
vorite dishes. Also, at the beginning and end of the quarter, Edith
Wu-Nguyen '99 and John Wu '95 MBA 'OO the two nicest
RFs on campus and their very cute toddler Elly usually host
brunch and a first-come, first-served farmer's market. You can re
quest grocery items ranging from toilet paper to spinach. They'll
buy it and you can put it in your bag, free of charge! Other options
include standard meal plans as well as a five-meal-per-week apart
ment meal plan. Another quick pro-tip: Sharpen your soliciting
skills.
Now, Oak Creek definitely has its shortcomings... or does it?
Only your best friends will be willing to make the trek up there reg

ularly, and when they are willing, you will have to spend an unrea
sonable amount of time giving directions. So most times, you will
be visiting others. This was especially the case for me and I noticed
that despite living in Oak Creek, I was visiting friends or going to
campus events nearly every day. After this year, I will never forget
how meaningful a simple visit to a friend's place can be. In many
ways, living further away from campus made me closer to this
school.

Ke beginning of autumn quarter or, more likely, the quarter
your study abroad quarter. Your friend asks, "Where are you
this year?" for the second or third time this week. You let
out a tiny sigh as you brace for the inevitably overblown reaction af
ter you respond, "Oak Creek."
Laughter, sympathy, consolation and your friend's relief that he
or she was not in your situation ensue —independently, collective
ly or perhaps even consecutively. You will probably try to create mu
tually agreed arrangements to camp out at your friend's place dur
ing the weekends, which will never take place. If that is not an op
tion, you desperately try to change the subject of the conversation or

pretend you have a class to save yourself from your misery.
But like any scenario in life, there is an even better option: suck
it up and look at the bright side. Whether you are the nerdiest of
FroSoCo nerds or a fiat boy socialite, Oak Creek is nothing short of
paradise if you let it be.
First off, Oak Creek has amenities galore. You have a barely used
gym steps away. A pool to cool a lover and yourself from the heat of
the night. A hot tub to read your favorite book in. Tennis courts. Plen
tiful green grass. BBQ grills. A beautiful and comfortable lounge with
never-ending beverages and sometimes chocolate chip cookies!
There's even a walking trail. If you squint your eyes and keep your
head pointed in one direction, you can even trick yourself into
thinking you are in a magical redwood forest. And at the end of the
day, you can treat yourself to an effing sauna session!
In your room, the amenities continue. Full kitchen with an
oven, stove, freezer, refrigerator and microwave. A dining room. A
living room. Single rooms and a good chance that your one-room
double will turn into a single due to study abroad or petitioning. A
private bathroom. Private closets. And a balcony.
Oak Creek is more of a resort than an apartment complex.
Renters actually pay around $20,000 to $40,000 to live here. Still,
eventually your glee over the amenities will fade and you will hope
fully find value in Oak Creek's less tangible benefits.
You will be able to ride your bike. To get to class, it takes 10
minutes by cycling. You can also drive, but most of the time, driving
is actually slower. Moreover, you can score up to $3OO from Stan
ford Parking and Transportation Services' commuter program by
not registering for a parking permit. (Note: Even without a permit,
you can still use your car to drive to campus on weekends and after
4 p.m. on weekdays.)
