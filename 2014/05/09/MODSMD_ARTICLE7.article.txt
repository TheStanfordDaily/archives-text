## Serendipity is bullshit 
### 
I've been thinking a lot about the power of serendipity.
Here in Silicon Valley, the word gets thrown around a lot,
usually in a magical context. Some people believe that
serendipity is something that descends from the heavens to
special people at special moments. Then there's the school of
thought that claims that serendipity "comes to those who work
hard for it." According to these people, preparing yourself to be
lucky is not only possible, it is one's responsibility in the meri
tocracy they believe Silicon Valley to be.
And then there's my chain of thought. I have come to re
alize that serendipity is, for the lack of a better word, bullshit. I
think that we need to do everything we can to eliminate it from
the world.

Why would we want to eliminate something so magical
and beautiful? The thing about serendipity is that, by definition, it
only happens once in a while. And as with all the flaws with peo
ple's ability to understand probability, we are much more likely to
notice the few times that serendipity happens to us than all the
times that it doesn't.

Imagine running into a close friend when you least expected
to see them. It is easy to appreciate the magic of the coincidence,
but perhaps not so easy to conceptualize all the times in the past
when you might have just missed a friend. I've come to be so
disillusioned with serendipity that when it happens to me, I
sometimes question whether it is even justified to enjoy it.
The thing is, as a designer, I'm not someone who likes to
leave things to chance. Indeed, the phrase "by design" by defi
nition implies "not accidental." What I cannot stand are things
that just "happen to be." Good designers like to be completely
in control of the experience they design. They want everything
to be exactly how they intended it to be. On the other hand, a
common feature of bad design is when the user is confused and
needs to rely on guesswork to proceed. A designer that relies
on chance to get the user to accomplish any task is not doing
his job right.
We've all had the experience of discovering that we share
an unlikely mutual friend with someone we know. It is a beau

tiful discovery and it makes us remember how small the world
is. Before Facebook, the process of figuring out that you shared
a mutual friend with someone relied almost entirely on chance:
one person mentioning the mutual friend in a conversation, or
someone accidentally discovering an artifact, like a picture, that
led to that realization. Back then, serendipity was the best solu
tion. I cannot imagine sitting down with someone and asking
them to name every single person they know to find the overlap
between our networks.

Similarly, I sometimes discover things that my friends and
I have in common after years of knowing them. When that hap
pens, I find it hard to appreciate the beauty of serendipity. In
stead, I start thinking about all the other things I don't know
about my friends and also about whether there are people out
there that I would absolutely love to be friends with, but neither
of us know it.

A lot of the purpose of technology is to remove serendipity
and replace it with design. As we all supply more and more in
formation about ourselves to our computers, they gain the abil
ity to do the annoying part of comparing us with other people
to find the right experiences for us. In addition, as a lot of the
things we do in our life move online, much of this data can be
collected passively—admittedly without our explicit permis
sion at times. What this allows us to do is to live in a world
where good things happen more often; instead of relying purely
on chance for us to find something that makes us happy, we can
create a world where such experiences happen all the time.
There is no doubt that it is magical to discover something
by accident: to stumble upon a scenic place or an amazing
restaurant. However, by trading away some of the pleasure of
this magic, we can choose to live in a world where we can have
these amazing experiences more often. And I think that is a sac
rifice worth making. Finding a friend to go to a concert with ten
times is much better than running into a friend when you're at
a concert alone once. Making friends with someone amazing
on a flight once, even though it makes for a great story, is still
not better than finding ten amazing friends on some website.
We are so stuck in the charm of chance that we don't see all the
power of the iceberg hidden beneath the surface.

nition implies "not accidental." What I cannot stand are things
that just "happen to be." Good designers like to be completely
in control of the experience they design. They want everything
to be exactly how they intended it to be. On the other hand, a
common feature of bad design is when the user is confused and
needs to rely on guesswork to proceed. A designer that relies
on chance to get the user to accomplish any task is not doing
his job right.
We've all had the experience of discovering that we share
an unlikely mutual friend with someone we know. It is a beau

tiful discovery and it makes us remember how small the world
is. Before Facebook, the process of figuring out that you shared
a mutual friend with someone relied almost entirely on chance:
one person mentioning the mutual friend in a conversation, or
someone accidentally discovering an artifact, like a picture, that
led to that realization. Back then, serendipity was the best solu
tion. I cannot imagine sitting down with someone and asking
them to name every single person they know to find the overlap
between our networks.

Similarly, I sometimes discover things that my friends and
I have in common after years of knowing them. When that hap
pens, I find it hard to appreciate the beauty of serendipity. In
stead, I start thinking about all the other things I don't know
about my friends and also about whether there are people out
there that I would absolutely love to be friends with, but neither
of us know it.

A lot of the purpose of technology is to remove serendipity
and replace it with design. As we all supply more and more in
formation about ourselves to our computers, they gain the abil
ity to do the annoying part of comparing us with other people
to find the right experiences for us. In addition, as a lot of the
things we do in our life move online, much of this data can be
collected passively—admittedly without our explicit permis
sion at times. What this allows us to do is to live in a world
where good things happen more often; instead of relying purely
on chance for us to find something that makes us happy, we can
create a world where such experiences happen all the time.
There is no doubt that it is magical to discover something
by accident: to stumble upon a scenic place or an amazing
restaurant. However, by trading away some of the pleasure of
this magic, we can choose to live in a world where we can have
these amazing experiences more often. And I think that is a sac
rifice worth making. Finding a friend to go to a concert with ten
times is much better than running into a friend when you're at
a concert alone once. Making friends with someone amazing
on a flight once, even though it makes for a great story, is still
not better than finding ten amazing friends on some website.
We are so stuck in the charm of chance that we don't see all the
power of the iceberg hidden beneath the surface.
