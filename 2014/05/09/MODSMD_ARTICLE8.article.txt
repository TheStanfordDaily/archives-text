## MAGIC SHOW REVIEW Kubinek dazzles crowd 
### SOPHIA DAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Certified lunatic and master
ful magician Toma? Kubinek
had the Bing Concert Hall
audience, ranging from 3 to
93 years young, alive with
laughter during his matinee
show on Sunday, May 4.
Adorned in an antique robe,
Kubinek drew the crowd in as he
shuffled silently to the stage. After
lighting a candle for ambient light,
Kubinek told stories from his child
hood, of the microscopic shared
candy at his grandmother's home
and of a magic show. Kubinek

punctuated his narratives with a
spot-on imitation of an operatic
record player and a sleight-of-hand
magic trick involving a disappear
ing red handkerchief.
Toma? Kubinek's early life sto
ry was as equally fascinating as his
opening impressions. Originally
from Prague, Kubinek's family fled
to Austria to escape the 1968 Sovi
et invasion of Czechoslovakia. Af
ter two months in Austria, Kubinek
came to Canada and joined the cir
cus scene, passionately taking in
clowns, circus, theater and magic.
Kubinek has since taken the world
