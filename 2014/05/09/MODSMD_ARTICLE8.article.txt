## MAGIC SHOW REVIEW Kubinek dazzles crowd 
### SOPHIA DAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Certified lunatic and master
ful magician Toma? Kubinek
had the Bing Concert Hall
audience, ranging from 3 to
93 years young, alive with
laughter during his matinee
show on Sunday, May 4.
Adorned in an antique robe,
Kubinek drew the crowd in as he
shuffled silently to the stage. After
lighting a candle for ambient light,
Kubinek told stories from his child
hood, of the microscopic shared
candy at his grandmother's home
and of a magic show. Kubinek

punctuated his narratives with a
spot-on imitation of an operatic
record player and a sleight-of-hand
magic trick involving a disappear
ing red handkerchief.
Toma? Kubinek's early life sto
ry was as equally fascinating as his
opening impressions. Originally
from Prague, Kubinek's family fled
to Austria to escape the 1968 Sovi
et invasion of Czechoslovakia. Af
ter two months in Austria, Kubinek
came to Canada and joined the cir
cus scene, passionately taking in
clowns, circus, theater and magic.
Kubinek has since taken the world


Courtesy of Stanford Live
by storm with his impassioned per
formances.

Kubinek made sure to interact
with his Stanford audience, praising
the acoustics of Bing Concert Hall
for allowing him to hear, with such
clarity, snaps, heartbeats and even
the voices in people's heads. He
even joked that he ought to rename
the concert hall "Bing Crosby Hall,"
remarking on the peculiarity in nam
ing a hall after a person's first name.
With a touch of playful uncer
tainty, the comic genius leapt onto
the seats to filch a woman's hand
bag. Kubinek delighted in the multi
zippered wallet within the bag, giv
ing the audience something to mar
vel at as he withdrew his red hand
kerchief from the final zipped wallet
compartment. Only after mysteri
ously finding six silver dining spoons
from the woman's bag did the magi
cian return the purse.
In a feat of musical flexibility,
Kubinek pulled out a petite soprano
ukulele and a glass of wine. The star
placed the filled wine glass on his

forehead and began strumming a
calm tune on the ukulele. The
serene music contrasted with the
odd contortions Kubinek's body
made as he somersaulted back
wards, while keeping the glass on
his head. As if this feat was not yet
remarkable enough, Kubinek pro
ceeded to play the ukulele behind
his back, as he finally unwound and
drank his much deserved glass of
wine, amazing every last audience
member.

After becoming and singing
songs of a six-legged man, the
vaudevillian selected an audience
member to come to the stage to par
ticipate in physically awkward ten
sion exercises for their slapstick hu
mour value. Kublnek concluded his
matinee show with a spectacular
flight around Bing Crosby Hall and a

last youth tale.
Kubinek's unique lighthearted

performance brought out the inno
cent child in everyone, drawing
forth positive energy and radiant
smiles from impish youngsters and
wise seniors alike. In the bustle of
everyday life, Kubinek's perform
ance serves as a reminder to appre
ciate every smile each day brings.
