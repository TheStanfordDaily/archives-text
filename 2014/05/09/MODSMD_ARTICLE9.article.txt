John Lennon's 1971 song, "Imagine," asks us to
imagine a world without racial, social, religious and
economic divisions. "Rolling Stone" magazine
summarized it as "22 lines of graceful, plain-spo
ken faith in the power of a world, united in pur
pose, to repair and change itself." Lennon, in an in
terview, said, "If you can imagine a world at peace, with
no denominations of religion not without religion but
without this my-God-is-bigger-than-your-God thing —
then it can become true."

The Triton Museum of Art in Santa Clara is present
ing "Imagine," an exhibition running through Aug. 3 that
was assembled by curator Preston Metcalf, featuring
works by 10 artists who were inspired by Lennon's time
ly and timeless song, as well as traditions other than the
prevailing scientific-rationalist capitalism.
Five of the artists look to the pre-industrial past for
inspiration. Elizabeth Jimenez Montelongo uses symbols
from the Nahuatl meso-american tradition, like pyramids,
serpents, skulls and mystic eyes. She also uses a symbolic
color palette derived from her study of Hindu chakras;
her symmetrically composed, icon-like paintings like "El
Fruto," "The Moon" and "Reclaiming Autonomy" exhort
us to reconsider ancient wisdom and formulate our own
worldviews.

LAuruS Myth, another artist, employs archaic or
mythic symbols like temples, columns, serpents, leaves,
starbursts, mandalas and spiritual eyes to evoke, in works
like "Initiation" and "Celebrating Creations," a state of
harmony with nature in which men and women achieve
their god/goddess potential.
Jojo Perea combines mystical symbols with motifs
drawn from art history and Abstract Expressionist
painterly improvisation. In "Looking for Eve," a quartet of
women's heads swirls around a recumbent Adam mod
eled on Michelangelo's a post-Christian feminist
retelling of the Creation myth.
Miguel Machaca attacks the dark side to spirituality
in his large charcoal drawing, "Orchestrated Religion," a
diptych representing a man and woman tortured by skull
faced angels and demons, bearing marks on their fore
heads of false enlightenment. Eyes sprouting from
branches of the Tree of life symbolize evolution beyond
tribal parochialism.

The other six artists mix and match more recent
styles and images. Mei-Ying Dell'Aquila combines western
style realism and eastern symbolism in oil paintings like
"Embrace Our Difference" and "Creation," with Lady lib
erty — an imported symbol in China, you may remember

—triumphant over "the flaws of the old system" and sym
bolic of the merger of Societal and personal, objective and
subjective. In "If Hope Had Wings," bubbles of hope waft
over an abandoned building, observed by a real bird and
one of those ineffectual vinyl owls.
Sarah Ratchye paints bright, Pop paintings (with odd
titles like "SpAs Born"" and "astrOnauts Land own PlAn,
KOlekt Rawx, Plant Flag") that seem to be derived from
collages of astronauts or cosmonauts, the contemporary
mythic heroes of scientific-rationalist cultures, set against
succulently painted swatches of advertising imagery.
Kelly Detweiler satirizes the mortgage crisis of
2008, the product of magical thinking by our Wall Street
Masters of the Universe, in light-hearted yet pointed
acrylics like "Meltdown" and "Bank-Owned." Both fea
ture bulls and bears engaged in home repossessions,
with the bulls as a styiistic nod to Picasso. He indicts to
day's supposedly rational monetization of everything
with "Money Changes Everything" with YES embla
zoned on a banner in yen, euro and dollar signs.
fhtrick "WaDI" Hofmeister in his intricately painted
"Octopi and Wasps," presents an Escheresque image of in
terlocking animal patterns, asserting that all life is connected.
Eric Victorino juxtaposes image and text in his
video-on-wall-paintings, "Don't Say You Want a Revolu
tion" and 'All You Need is Insanely Obsessive Love." The
titles refer, of course, to Beatles songs of the late 19605,
and the block-lettered monologues muse on love and
war, counterpointed by real-world video from that turbu
lent time. Hofmeister employs words in his unpunctuat
ed "Run-On Sentence" placards. Finally, Ron Garcia re
turns us to John Lennon with a high-contract portrait in
blue, and a tall, vertical painting of the lyrics of "Imagine,"
a typographically unspaced modern-day column or com
memorative stele.

ken faith in the power of a world, united in pur
pose, to repair and change itself." Lennon, in an in
terview, said, "If you can imagine a world at peace, with
no denominations of religion not without religion but
without this my-God-is-bigger-than-your-God thing —
then it can become true."

The Triton Museum of Art in Santa Clara is present
ing "Imagine," an exhibition running through Aug. 3 that
was assembled by curator Preston Metcalf, featuring
works by 10 artists who were inspired by Lennon's time
ly and timeless song, as well as traditions other than the
prevailing scientific-rationalist capitalism.
Five of the artists look to the pre-industrial past for
inspiration. Elizabeth Jimenez Montelongo uses symbols
from the Nahuatl meso-american tradition, like pyramids,
serpents, skulls and mystic eyes. She also uses a symbolic
color palette derived from her study of Hindu chakras;
her symmetrically composed, icon-like paintings like "El
Fruto," "The Moon" and "Reclaiming Autonomy" exhort
us to reconsider ancient wisdom and formulate our own
worldviews.

LAuruS Myth, another artist, employs archaic or
mythic symbols like temples, columns, serpents, leaves,
starbursts, mandalas and spiritual eyes to evoke, in works
like "Initiation" and "Celebrating Creations," a state of
harmony with nature in which men and women achieve
their god/goddess potential.
Jojo Perea combines mystical symbols with motifs
drawn from art history and Abstract Expressionist
painterly improvisation. In "Looking for Eve," a quartet of
women's heads swirls around a recumbent Adam mod
eled on Michelangelo's a post-Christian feminist
retelling of the Creation myth.
Miguel Machaca attacks the dark side to spirituality
in his large charcoal drawing, "Orchestrated Religion," a
diptych representing a man and woman tortured by skull
faced angels and demons, bearing marks on their fore
heads of false enlightenment. Eyes sprouting from
branches of the Tree of life symbolize evolution beyond
tribal parochialism.

The other six artists mix and match more recent
styles and images. Mei-Ying Dell'Aquila combines western
style realism and eastern symbolism in oil paintings like
"Embrace Our Difference" and "Creation," with Lady lib
erty — an imported symbol in China, you may remember

—triumphant over "the flaws of the old system" and sym
bolic of the merger of Societal and personal, objective and
subjective. In "If Hope Had Wings," bubbles of hope waft
over an abandoned building, observed by a real bird and
one of those ineffectual vinyl owls.
Sarah Ratchye paints bright, Pop paintings (with odd
titles like "SpAs Born"" and "astrOnauts Land own PlAn,
KOlekt Rawx, Plant Flag") that seem to be derived from
collages of astronauts or cosmonauts, the contemporary
mythic heroes of scientific-rationalist cultures, set against
succulently painted swatches of advertising imagery.
Kelly Detweiler satirizes the mortgage crisis of
2008, the product of magical thinking by our Wall Street
Masters of the Universe, in light-hearted yet pointed
acrylics like "Meltdown" and "Bank-Owned." Both fea
ture bulls and bears engaged in home repossessions,
with the bulls as a styiistic nod to Picasso. He indicts to
day's supposedly rational monetization of everything
with "Money Changes Everything" with YES embla
zoned on a banner in yen, euro and dollar signs.
fhtrick "WaDI" Hofmeister in his intricately painted
"Octopi and Wasps," presents an Escheresque image of in
terlocking animal patterns, asserting that all life is connected.
Eric Victorino juxtaposes image and text in his
video-on-wall-paintings, "Don't Say You Want a Revolu
tion" and 'All You Need is Insanely Obsessive Love." The
titles refer, of course, to Beatles songs of the late 19605,
and the block-lettered monologues muse on love and
war, counterpointed by real-world video from that turbu
lent time. Hofmeister employs words in his unpunctuat
ed "Run-On Sentence" placards. Finally, Ron Garcia re
turns us to John Lennon with a high-contract portrait in
blue, and a tall, vertical painting of the lyrics of "Imagine,"
a typographically unspaced modern-day column or com
memorative stele.
