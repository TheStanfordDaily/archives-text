# SIX PLAYERS GET THE CALL
## Skov undrafted, signs with 49ers 
### JOSEPH BEYDA EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
Six Cardinal football players
were picked in the 2014 NFL Draft
on Friday and Saturday to tie a pro
gram record and lead the Pac-12,
and at least five more have already
signed as undrafted free agents.
But even with those impressive
numbers, several Stanford players

were selected later than expected,
most notably inside
linebacker Shayne Skov, who was
n't drafted at all.

"Gunna make my mark in this
league before it's all over," he
tweeted on Saturday.
The draft festivities for the Car
dinal began with the expected sec
ond-round selection of outside line
backer Trent Murphy by the Wash
ington Redskins on Friday night.
After that, it took until the last pick
in the fourth round for the next
Stanford player, offensive
tackle Cameron Fleming, to leave
the board and join the New Eng
land Patriots.

Though Skov signed with the
San Francisco 49ers rejoining
former Stanford head coach Jim
Harbaugh and defensive coordina
tor Vic Fangio on Saturday
evening, it was assumed entering
the weekend that the four-year
starter and heart of the Cardinal
defense would be chosen in the
draft. After so many years of domi
nance for the Stanford defense, it
appears that Skov still has some

sive guard David Yankey (Minneso
ta Vikings) and free safety Ed
Reynolds (Philadelphia Eagles) in
the fifth, running back Tyler
Gaffney(Carolina Panthers) in the
sixth and defensive end Ben Gard
ner (Dallas Cowboys) in the sev
enth.

Yankey's sixth-round selection
was relatively late for the highly
touted guard. But his wasn't the
biggest slide for a Cardinal star
over the weekend, as all 256 picks

came and went without
Skov's name being called.
Of course, several un
drafted free agents (UFAs)
from the Farm have come
into and made their mark on
the league in recent years, in
cluding defensive back
Michael Thomas 'l2 and wide
receivers Doug Baldwin 'll
and Griff Whalen 'l2.
But Skov's college resume
is arguably the strongest of
that bunch, potentially sig
naling lingering concerns
over the linebacker's recov
ery from his ACL/MCL tear
as a junior. Skov's team-lead
ing 109-tackle performance
in 2013 went a long way to
ward proving that he has pro
caliber speed. Apparently,
that wasn't enough for NFL
GMs.

Stanford fans' disappoint
ment that Skov wasn't draft
ed was at least partially offset
by the Cowboys' selection of
Gardner, an under-the-radar
prospect despite his three
years as an anchor of the Car
dinal's defensive line.
Gardner's draft stock
plummeted after a late-sea
son pectoral tear in 2013. The
NFL Combine snub regained
that footing with an impres
sive showing at Stanford's

pro day, and that likely
earned him a spot with a Dal
las team that is looking to
shore up its depth after a dis
astrous defensive effort last
season.

Murphy joins a Redskins
team with a pair of All-Pro
outside linebackers already.
He's being billed in Washing
ton as a potential successor to
Brian Orakpo or Ryan Kerri
gan, who are currently under
contract for one and two
years, respectively.

The Cardinal's second
player selected, Fleming, is
also unlikely to start in 2014-
15, with Marcus Cannon and
Sebastian Vollmer ahead of
him on New England's depth
chart at right tackle. If that
projection holds true, Flem
ing will essentially replace
Stanford alum Will Svitek 'O4,
who was not resigned by the
Patriots as a backup tackle.
But Gaffney might have
the tallest ladder to climb.
The Panthers have a host of
other running backs under
contract, including a former
Cardinal nemesis, Oregon's
Kenjon Barner.

Covering Philadelphia
tight end Zach Ertz 'l3,
whose speed and size made
him dominant at Stanford
and led to a 36-catch, 4-touch
down rookie season, is a mis
match for any defensive back.
Now that defensive back
at least at Eagles practices

will be his former Cardinal
teammate, Reynolds.

As of Saturday night, the
other confirmed UFA sign
ings from Stanford were full
back Ryan Hewitt with the
Bengals and defensive
end Josh Mauro and free
safety Devon
Carrington with the Steelers.
Little buzz surrounded Car
rington entering the week
end, but Hewitt and Mauro
were also surprising draft
misses.
In Pittsburgh, Mauro and
Carrington will rejoin former
Cardinal teammate David
DeCastro 'l2, a starting of
fensive lineman for the Steel
ers.
After rumors on Saturday,
running back Anthony Wilk
erson confirmed on Sunday
that he had signed with the
Colts, making him the fifth
former Stanford player
(along with Andrew Luck 'l2,
Coby Fleener 'll, Delano
Howell 'l2 and Whalen) cur
rently in Indianapolis.
Inside linebacker Jarek
Lancaster also announced on
Sunday that he had received
a rookie minicamp invitation
from the Oakland Riders.
Kevin Danser and Khalil
Wilkes round out the list of
outgoing Stanford players
looking for a pro contract.
Neither has signed yet.

tight end Zach Ertz 'l3,
whose speed and size made
him dominant at Stanford
and led to a 36-catch, 4-touch
down rookie season, is a mis
match for any defensive back.
Now that defensive back
at least at Eagles practices

will be his former Cardinal
teammate, Reynolds.

As of Saturday night, the
other confirmed UFA sign
ings from Stanford were full
back Ryan Hewitt with the
Bengals and defensive
end Josh Mauro and free
safety Devon
Carrington with the Steelers.
Little buzz surrounded Car
rington entering the week
end, but Hewitt and Mauro
were also surprising draft
misses.
In Pittsburgh, Mauro and
Carrington will rejoin former
Cardinal teammate David
DeCastro 'l2, a starting of
fensive lineman for the Steel
ers.
After rumors on Saturday,
running back Anthony Wilk
erson confirmed on Sunday
that he had signed with the
Colts, making him the fifth
former Stanford player
(along with Andrew Luck 'l2,
Coby Fleener 'll, Delano
Howell 'l2 and Whalen) cur

Inside linebacker Jarek
Lancaster also announced on
Sunday that he had received
a rookie minicamp invitation

Kevin Danser and Khalil
Wilkes round out the list of
outgoing Stanford players
looking for a pro contract.
Neither has signed yet.

Six Cardinal football players
were picked in the 2014 NFL Draft
on Friday and Saturday to tie a pro
gram record and lead the Pac-12,
and at least five more have already
signed as undrafted free agents.
But even with those impressive
numbers, several Stanford players

were selected later than expected,
most notably inside
linebacker Shayne Skov, who was
n't drafted at all.

"Gunna make my mark in this
league before it's all over," he
tweeted on Saturday.
The draft festivities for the Car
dinal began with the expected sec
ond-round selection of outside line
backer Trent Murphy by the Wash
ington Redskins on Friday night.
After that, it took until the last pick
in the fourth round for the next
Stanford player, offensive
tackle Cameron Fleming, to leave
the board and join the New Eng

Fleming was followed by offen-

Though Skov signed with the
San Francisco 49ers rejoining
former Stanford head coach Jim
Harbaugh and defensive coordina
tor Vic Fangio on Saturday
evening, it was assumed entering
the weekend that the four-year
starter and heart of the Cardinal
defense would be chosen in the
draft. After so many years of domi
nance for the Stanford defense, it
appears that Skov still has some

sive guard David Yankey (Minneso
ta Vikings) and free safety Ed
Reynolds (Philadelphia Eagles) in
the fifth, running back Tyler
Gaffney(Carolina Panthers) in the
sixth and defensive end Ben Gard
ner (Dallas Cowboys) in the sev
enth.

Yankey's sixth-round selection
was relatively late for the highly
touted guard. But his wasn't the
biggest slide for a Cardinal star
over the weekend, as all 256 picks

came and went without
Skov's name being called.
Of course, several un
drafted free agents (UFAs)
from the Farm have come
into and made their mark on
the league in recent years, in
cluding defensive back
Michael Thomas 'l2 and wide
receivers Doug Baldwin 'll
and Griff Whalen 'l2.
But Skov's college resume
is arguably the strongest of
that bunch, potentially sig
naling lingering concerns
over the linebacker's recov
ery from his ACL/MCL tear
as a junior. Skov's team-lead
ing 109-tackle performance
in 2013 went a long way to
ward proving that he has pro
caliber speed. Apparently,
that wasn't enough for NFL
GMs.

Stanford fans' disappoint
ment that Skov wasn't draft
ed was at least partially offset
by the Cowboys' selection of
Gardner, an under-the-radar
prospect despite his three
years as an anchor of the Car
dinal's defensive line.
Gardner's draft stock
plummeted after a late-sea
son pectoral tear in 2013. The
NFL Combine snub regained
that footing with an impres
sive showing at Stanford's

pro day, and that likely
earned him a spot with a Dal
las team that is looking to
shore up its depth after a dis
astrous defensive effort last
season.

Murphy joins a Redskins
team with a pair of All-Pro
outside linebackers already.
He's being billed in Washing
ton as a potential successor to
Brian Orakpo or Ryan Kerri
gan, who are currently under
contract for one and two
years, respectively.

The Cardinal's second
player selected, Fleming, is
also unlikely to start in 2014-
15, with Marcus Cannon and
Sebastian Vollmer ahead of
him on New England's depth
chart at right tackle. If that
projection holds true, Flem
ing will essentially replace
Stanford alum Will Svitek 'O4,
who was not resigned by the
Patriots as a backup tackle.
But Gaffney might have
the tallest ladder to climb.
