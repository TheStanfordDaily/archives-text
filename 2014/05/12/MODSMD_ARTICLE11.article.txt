# Taking care of business
## Women's tennis heads to Athens 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
Many other teams around the
country would call it a successful sea
son with just the Sweet 16 berth that
No. 11 Stanford women's tennis
earned this weekend. But for Stan
ford, it's business as usual.
The defending national champion
Cardinal (18-2, 8-2 Pac-12) made a
huge splash in the first two rounds of
the NCAA Tournament, cruising to
twin 4-0 victories on Friday and Sat
urday, first in the round of 64 against
Quinnipiac (13-11, 8-0 MAAC) and
then in the round of 32 against No. 53
Long Beach State (21-3, 8-0 Big
West) to clinch their spot in Athens,
Georgia, for the final rounds of the
tournament.
"I definitely think these two wins
have contributed to our confidence,"
said freshman Caroline Doyle.
"We're definitely heading into
Athens with a lot of confidence and
energy and we're hoping to really
prevail there."
After the Cardinal had received a
surprisingly low No. 11 seed for this
year's tournament, the team felt that
it had something to prove in these
early rounds and made its presence
felt on the courts early and often
over the weekend.
"I think we've got something to
show for now," said junior Ellen Tsay.
"It's almost good in a sense; we're
going to prove what we should actu
ally be seeded just by our perform
ance, so it serves as additional moti
vation."
On Saturday, seemingly nothing
could slow the Cardinal down not
even the two-hour delay that the

team had to sit through before it
could get on the courts. With the
match preceding Stanford's the
other first-round match hosted by
Stanford between Long Beach State
and Tulsa turning into a
marathon match that took Long
Beach State five hours to eventually
win, the Cardinal's slated start time
of 2 p.m. was pushed back to just
after 4 p.m.
But the Cardinal were quick to
make up for lost time, effortlessly
cruising to victory in under 90 min
utes against an outmatched Quinnip
iac squad that had no answers for
Stanford's power and depth on any
of the courts.
Although the lOth-ranked dou
bles pairing of senior Kristie Ahn
and freshman Carol Zhao took a
more methodical pace on court one,
its score ultimately did not matter
due to the quick, efficient dominance
on the other two courts from Stan
ford's other pairs.
Tsay and freshman Taylor David-

son ranked No. 50 in the nation
cruised past junior Michelle Dassa
and junior Jacqueline Raynor in an
8-0 rout that established an increas
ingly frustrated tone in the play of
the pah* from Quinnipiac. Just min
utes later, Doyle and senior Amelia
Herring wi-apped up then- own quick
8-1 victory on court three to clinch
the doubles point and get the Cardi
nal off to a roaring start.

It was just a sign of things to
come for the Cardinal, who never
looked back in the singles portion of
the match. Tsay and Doyle were
ruthlessly efficient on the back
courts, notching twin 6-0, 6-0 victo
ries in the blink of an eye to put Stan
ford ahead 3-0 before Quinnipiac
even had a chance to catch its breath.
It didn't take long for sophomore
Krista Hardebeck to claim the
clincher on court two with a 6-0, 6-1
victory to bury the Bobcats.
"I think we made a statement by
not dropping too many games and
getting off the courts really quickly,
especially after the long wait," Tsay
said after the Friday match. "I think
that prepares us really well for to
morrow and we're excited to move
on."
On Saturday against Long Beach
State in a very windy second-round
matchup, the upped difficulty in the
level of competition was pronounced,

Freshman Caroline Doyle (above) improved her record to a team-leading 30-5 with a pair of dominant victories
over the weekend against outmatched competitors from both Quinnipiac and Long Beach State.
with the doubles point becom
ing a hard-fought, back-and
forth affair that dragged on
for over an hour.
Davidson and Tsay were
able to establish control in
their match to a greater ex
tent than their teammates on
the other two courts, and the
pah- was the first finished with
an 8-5 win on court two. Mean
while, on court one, Ahn and
Zhao were still fiercely bat
tling in a dead heat after
bouncing back from a 3-5
deficit. That match would ulti
mately prove inconsequential,
however, as Doyle and Her
ring were able to pull out a 7-5
tiebreaker that clinched a
very evenly matched competi
tion on court three and give
Stanford the doubles point.
After the tough doubles
matchup, singles went much
more smoothly all around the

board for the Cardinal, with
Tsay and Doyle again plowing
through their opponents with
ease. Tsay won her first 20 sin
gles games of the tournament
before finally dropping one in
the second set to freshman
Hayley Thompson en route to
a 6-0, 6-1 victory. Doyle also
had another easy time in a 6-2,
6-1 victory that ultimately
provided the clincher and
punched the Cardinal's ticket
to the Sweet 16. Zhao provid
ed the other point with a 6-1,6-
1 effort on court three.
With the win, Doyle
clinched her 18th win in her
last 20 matches and improved
her record to a team-leading
30-5.

"I think the backside
[courts four, five and six] has
been doing really well," Doyle
said. "Obviously I can't see the
stadium; I'm sure they've been
doing equally as well, but on
the backside we've had a lot of
really good energy and we've
been cheering each other on.
It's been tough conditions for
the last two days but we
haven't really let it get to us
and we've taken care of what
we needed to take care of."
Although Zhao and Hard
ebeck were having an easy
time in the stadium as well,
the same could not be said for
Ahn, who was playing in the
final match of her Stanford ca
reer at home in Taube Family
Tennis Stadium.
The normally steadfast
senior and third-ranked sin

gles player in the nation was
having trouble with her con
trol and was expressing lots of
frustration at her uncharac
teristically frequent unforced
errors throughout the after
noon.
"As far as her college ca
reer, I'm sure it was in her
mind a little bit," said head
coach Lele Forood. "The con
ditions were really rough, and
she's a really precise hitter.
She does a lot of things at the
last moment to the ball, and in
this kind of wind, you really
can't play like that. She was
frustrating herself with some
of that."
Despite the struggles and
falling behind late, however,
Ahn was still locked in her
first-set tiebreak when her
match was abandoned due to
Stanford's victory and she
thus left her final weekend at
home not having lost any sets.
The confident Cardinal
will next head to Athens,
Georgia, the host of this year's
national tournament, to take
on fierce rival No. 6 Cal in the
Sweet 16. It will be the teams'
third meeting of the season,
with the Cardinal having won
the first before the Golden
Bears won the second in the
regular-season finale. The
match will get underway at 9
a.m. PST on Thursday with a
berth in the Elite Eight on the
line.

Many other teams around the
country would call it a successful sea
son with just the Sweet 16 berth that
No. 11 Stanford women's tennis
earned this weekend. But for Stan
ford, it's business as usual.
The defending national champion
Cardinal (18-2, 8-2 Pac-12) made a
huge splash in the first two rounds of
the NCAA Tournament, cruising to
twin 4-0 victories on Friday and Sat
urday, first in the round of 64 against
Quinnipiac (13-11, 8-0 MAAC) and
then in the round of 32 against No. 53
Long Beach State (21-3, 8-0 Big
West) to clinch their spot in Athens,
Georgia, for the final rounds of the
tournament.
"I definitely think these two wins
have contributed to our confidence,"
said freshman Caroline Doyle.
"We're definitely heading into
Athens with a lot of confidence and
energy and we're hoping to really
prevail there."
After the Cardinal had received a
surprisingly low No. 11 seed for this
year's tournament, the team felt that
it had something to prove in these
early rounds and made its presence
felt on the courts early and often
over the weekend.
"I think we've got something to
show for now," said junior Ellen Tsay.
"It's almost good in a sense; we're
going to prove what we should actu
ally be seeded just by our perform
ance, so it serves as additional moti
vation."
On Saturday, seemingly nothing
could slow the Cardinal down not
even the two-hour delay that the

team had to sit through before it
could get on the courts. With the
match preceding Stanford's the
other first-round match hosted by
Stanford between Long Beach State
and Tulsa turning into a
marathon match that took Long
Beach State five hours to eventually
win, the Cardinal's slated start time
of 2 p.m. was pushed back to just
after 4 p.m.
But the Cardinal were quick to
make up for lost time, effortlessly
cruising to victory in under 90 min
utes against an outmatched Quinnip
iac squad that had no answers for
Stanford's power and depth on any
of the courts.
Although the lOth-ranked dou
bles pairing of senior Kristie Ahn
and freshman Carol Zhao took a
more methodical pace on court one,
its score ultimately did not matter
due to the quick, efficient dominance
on the other two courts from Stan
ford's other pairs.
Tsay and freshman Taylor David-

son ranked No. 50 in the nation
cruised past junior Michelle Dassa
and junior Jacqueline Raynor in an
8-0 rout that established an increas
ingly frustrated tone in the play of
the pah* from Quinnipiac. Just min
utes later, Doyle and senior Amelia
Herring wi-apped up then- own quick
8-1 victory on court three to clinch
the doubles point and get the Cardi
nal off to a roaring start.

It was just a sign of things to
come for the Cardinal, who never
looked back in the singles portion of
the match. Tsay and Doyle were
ruthlessly efficient on the back
courts, notching twin 6-0, 6-0 victo
ries in the blink of an eye to put Stan
ford ahead 3-0 before Quinnipiac
even had a chance to catch its breath.
It didn't take long for sophomore
Krista Hardebeck to claim the
clincher on court two with a 6-0, 6-1
victory to bury the Bobcats.
"I think we made a statement by
not dropping too many games and

said after the Friday match. "I think

After the tough doubles
matchup, singles went much
more smoothly all around the

board for the Cardinal, with
Tsay and Doyle again plowing
through their opponents with
ease. Tsay won her first 20 sin
gles games of the tournament
before finally dropping one in
the second set to freshman
Hayley Thompson en route to
a 6-0, 6-1 victory. Doyle also
had another easy time in a 6-2,
6-1 victory that ultimately
provided the clincher and
punched the Cardinal's ticket
to the Sweet 16. Zhao provid
ed the other point with a 6-1,6-
1 effort on court three.
With the win, Doyle
clinched her 18th win in her
last 20 matches and improved
her record to a team-leading
30-5.

"I think the backside
[courts four, five and six] has
been doing really well," Doyle
said. "Obviously I can't see the
stadium; I'm sure they've been
doing equally as well, but on
the backside we've had a lot of

Stanford the doubles point.
After the tough doubles
matchup, singles went much
more smoothly all around the

board for the Cardinal, with
Tsay and Doyle again plowing
through their opponents with
ease. Tsay won her first 20 sin
gles games of the tournament
before finally dropping one in
the second set to freshman
Hayley Thompson en route to
a 6-0, 6-1 victory. Doyle also
had another easy time in a 6-2,
6-1 victory that ultimately
provided the clincher and
punched the Cardinal's ticket
to the Sweet 16. Zhao provid
ed the other point with a 6-1,6-
1 effort on court three.
With the win, Doyle
clinched her 18th win in her
last 20 matches and improved
her record to a team-leading
30-5.

"I think the backside
[courts four, five and six] has
been doing really well," Doyle
said. "Obviously I can't see the
stadium; I'm sure they've been
doing equally as well, but on
the backside we've had a lot of
really good energy and we've
been cheering each other on.
It's been tough conditions for
the last two days but we
haven't really let it get to us
and we've taken care of what
we needed to take care of."
Although Zhao and Hard
ebeck were having an easy
time in the stadium as well,
the same could not be said for
Ahn, who was playing in the
final match of her Stanford ca
reer at home in Taube Family
Tennis Stadium.
The normally steadfast
senior and third-ranked sin

gles player in the nation was
having trouble with her con
trol and was expressing lots of
frustration at her uncharac
teristically frequent unforced
errors throughout the after
noon.
"As far as her college ca
reer, I'm sure it was in her
mind a little bit," said head
coach Lele Forood. "The con
ditions were really rough, and
she's a really precise hitter.
She does a lot of things at the
last moment to the ball, and in
this kind of wind, you really
can't play like that. She was
frustrating herself with some
of that."
Despite the struggles and
falling behind late, however,
Ahn was still locked in her
first-set tiebreak when her
match was abandoned due to
Stanford's victory and she
thus left her final weekend at
home not having lost any sets.
The confident Cardinal
will next head to Athens,
Georgia, the host of this year's
national tournament, to take
on fierce rival No. 6 Cal in the
Sweet 16. It will be the teams'
third meeting of the season,
with the Cardinal having won
the first before the Golden
Bears won the second in the
regular-season finale. The
match will get underway at 9
a.m. PST on Thursday with a
berth in the Elite Eight on the
line.
