# Taking care of business
## Women's tennis heads to Athens 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
Many other teams around the
country would call it a successful sea
son with just the Sweet 16 berth that
No. 11 Stanford women's tennis
earned this weekend. But for Stan
ford, it's business as usual.
The defending national champion
Cardinal (18-2, 8-2 Pac-12) made a
huge splash in the first two rounds of
the NCAA Tournament, cruising to
twin 4-0 victories on Friday and Sat
urday, first in the round of 64 against
Quinnipiac (13-11, 8-0 MAAC) and
then in the round of 32 against No. 53
Long Beach State (21-3, 8-0 Big
West) to clinch their spot in Athens,
Georgia, for the final rounds of the
tournament.
"I definitely think these two wins
have contributed to our confidence,"
said freshman Caroline Doyle.
"We're definitely heading into
Athens with a lot of confidence and
energy and we're hoping to really
prevail there."
After the Cardinal had received a
surprisingly low No. 11 seed for this
year's tournament, the team felt that
it had something to prove in these
early rounds and made its presence
felt on the courts early and often
over the weekend.
"I think we've got something to
show for now," said junior Ellen Tsay.
"It's almost good in a sense; we're
going to prove what we should actu
ally be seeded just by our perform
ance, so it serves as additional moti
vation."
On Saturday, seemingly nothing
could slow the Cardinal down not
even the two-hour delay that the

team had to sit through before it
could get on the courts. With the
match preceding Stanford's the
other first-round match hosted by
Stanford between Long Beach State
and Tulsa turning into a
marathon match that took Long
Beach State five hours to eventually
win, the Cardinal's slated start time
of 2 p.m. was pushed back to just
after 4 p.m.
But the Cardinal were quick to
make up for lost time, effortlessly
cruising to victory in under 90 min
utes against an outmatched Quinnip
iac squad that had no answers for
Stanford's power and depth on any
of the courts.
Although the lOth-ranked dou
bles pairing of senior Kristie Ahn
and freshman Carol Zhao took a
more methodical pace on court one,
its score ultimately did not matter
due to the quick, efficient dominance
on the other two courts from Stan
ford's other pairs.
Tsay and freshman Taylor David-

son ranked No. 50 in the nation
cruised past junior Michelle Dassa
and junior Jacqueline Raynor in an
8-0 rout that established an increas
ingly frustrated tone in the play of
the pah* from Quinnipiac. Just min
utes later, Doyle and senior Amelia
Herring wi-apped up then- own quick
8-1 victory on court three to clinch
the doubles point and get the Cardi
nal off to a roaring start.

It was just a sign of things to
come for the Cardinal, who never
looked back in the singles portion of
the match. Tsay and Doyle were
ruthlessly efficient on the back
courts, notching twin 6-0, 6-0 victo
ries in the blink of an eye to put Stan
ford ahead 3-0 before Quinnipiac
even had a chance to catch its breath.
It didn't take long for sophomore
Krista Hardebeck to claim the
clincher on court two with a 6-0, 6-1
victory to bury the Bobcats.
"I think we made a statement by
not dropping too many games and
getting off the courts really quickly,
especially after the long wait," Tsay
said after the Friday match. "I think
that prepares us really well for to
morrow and we're excited to move
on."
On Saturday against Long Beach
State in a very windy second-round
matchup, the upped difficulty in the
level of competition was pronounced,
