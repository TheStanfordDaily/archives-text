## The 						economic disparities of being abroad 
### Joe Troderman 
In most ways my time studying
abroad in Japan has been very
positive. But while Stanford has
eliminated the physical barrier for
lower-income individuals to study
abroad, the expensive spending cul
ture prevalent in many study
abroad programs remains in Stan
ford's. Simple remedies do exist
that could mitigate this, though.
At other schools, study abroad
can be much more expensive than
studying on campus. Living can
cost more, people eat out for meals
more frequently and then there are
costs incurred by commuting to
class. As a result, study abroad
often has a reputation of elitism as
sociated with it: Rich individuals go
abroad for a term to essentially
take a vacation for a semester, trav
eling around Europe with a much
lighter course load.
I've personally observed many
students who studied abroad for a
full year and came back no better at
the foreign language they went
abroad to learn than before they
left quite counter to the purpose
of going abroad. Granted, it might
be more difficult to become fluent in
a language while studying these
days since that English is more
common abroad, but the result is
still not what one should expect.

This is in stark contrast with
Stanford's Bing Overseas Studies
Program (BOSP). Stanford's pro
gram, thanks in large part to the
generosity of Peter and Helen Bing,
allows students who want to study
abroad to simply pay their normal
tuition to Stanford. This means that
students on financial aid pay the
same amount to study abroad as
they would to study on campus.
Furthermore, housing and food
fees tend to be cheaper abroad than
on campus, a benefit of not being on
the meal plan. Including the price of
my airfare to and from Japan, I ac
tually spend less money for school
during my term abroad in Kyoto
than I would at Stanford. There are
many reasons that about 50 percent
of each Stanford graduating class
studies abroad (and the percentage
is still growing), but one of them is
certainly the economic accessibility
of BOSP

While Stanford makes study
abroad less expensive for low-in
come students, the history of study
abroad and the culture associated
with it from other schools still pres
sures students to spend. For exam
ple, while fairly cheap, travel costs
in Kyoto, Japan where I study
add up quickly. If one wants to go
to a shrine (a key and wonderful
feature of Kyoto's culture that
makes it the home of many World
Heritage Sites), a round trip usual
ly costs $5 to $lO, entrance fees are
about the same and lunch and din
ner will add another $l5 or so. Cu
mulatively, you might spend $25 in a
day. Although the sights are all
worth it, when you live in a city with
hundreds of places worth seeing,
spending around $2O a day can be
come $2OO in less than a month
and this is just for the essential
parts of study abroad. If you add in
drinking parties, travel to nearby
cities with more history and more
to see or even just essential costs
like buying a phone for emergen
cies, the cost goes up even more.
This need to travel certainly ex
ists in other programs, too. While
one may be in Paris, you cannot
simply stay in Paris and not go on
weekend trips to see Marseilles,
Bordeaux, Madrid, Berlin and Lon
don, as well as club in each of those

cities while you are near them. I am
speaking a bit hyperbolically, but
this sentiment does exist for many
students studying abroad. This is
where coming from a poorer back
ground can mean having to say no
to trips and activities with everyone
else. It is an experience that can be
isolating. In part, I believe this to be
the legacy of programs that have
historically been for wealthy indi
viduals at a university that still does
(and will into the unforeseeable fu
ture) have a socio-economic dispar
ity, with a disproportionate amount
of students coming to Stanford
from rich backgrounds.

How can Stanford combat this?
One major way is to shift more of
the focus of the study abroad pro
grams onto the host cities them
selves. I think Kyoto already does
this quite well: It features classes
about Japanese culture, religion
and politics that all take field trips
in Kyoto and occasional trips to
nearby cities (all of which are paid
for by the program). To further
strengthen this idea, travel passes
for transportation within the city
could drastically increase intra-city
travel: There are so many sights to
see in Florence itself, for example,
and it seems silly to travel hundreds
of miles to see a famous statue when
there are marvelous works that you
have yet to see in your host city. Pro
grams might also work to empha
size the great activities worth doing
locally and help organize student
trips, allowing people to better get
to know each other as well.

Finally, if the program in Kyoto
is any testament, Stanford does a
fantastic job of selecting host fami
lies that actually care about and
want to get to know their students.
Traveling makes this quite diffi
cult, and being a classic tourist lim
its one's ability to advance one's
language acquisition. There is cer
tainly value in getting to know an
area well, and becoming close
friends with people abroad is a
great joy.
These ideas and goals are al
ready advanced by BOSP to a cer
tain extent, but could be pursued a
bit more strongly. Economic dispar
ities cannot be neutralized
overnight, but they certainly
should not characterize and define
the study abroad experience. Ad
justing BOSP could help students
have an even better experience
abroad while also breaking down
some of the economic barriers that
still exist.

one may be in Paris, you cannot
simply stay in Paris and not go on
weekend trips to see Marseilles,
Bordeaux, Madrid, Berlin and Lon
don, as well as club in each of those

cities while you are near them. I am
speaking a bit hyperbolically, but
this sentiment does exist for many
students studying abroad. This is
where coming from a poorer back
ground can mean having to say no
to trips and activities with everyone
else. It is an experience that can be
isolating. In part, I believe this to be
the legacy of programs that have
historically been for wealthy indi
viduals at a university that still does
(and will into the unforeseeable fu
ture) have a socio-economic dispar
ity, with a disproportionate amount
of students coming to Stanford
from rich backgrounds.

How can Stanford combat this?
One major way is to shift more of
the focus of the study abroad pro
grams onto the host cities them
selves. I think Kyoto already does
this quite well: It features classes
about Japanese culture, religion
and politics that all take field trips
in Kyoto and occasional trips to
nearby cities (all of which are paid
for by the program). To further
strengthen this idea, travel passes
for transportation within the city
could drastically increase intra-city
travel: There are so many sights to
see in Florence itself, for example,
and it seems silly to travel hundreds
of miles to see a famous statue when
there are marvelous works that you
have yet to see in your host city. Pro
grams might also work to empha
size the great activities worth doing
locally and help organize student
trips, allowing people to better get
to know each other as well.

Finally, if the program in Kyoto
is any testament, Stanford does a
fantastic job of selecting host fami
lies that actually care about and
want to get to know their students.
Traveling makes this quite diffi
cult, and being a classic tourist lim
its one's ability to advance one's
language acquisition. There is cer
tainly value in getting to know an
area well, and becoming close
friends with people abroad is a
great joy.
These ideas and goals are al
ready advanced by BOSP to a cer
tain extent, but could be pursued a
bit more strongly. Economic dispar
ities cannot be neutralized
overnight, but they certainly
should not characterize and define
the study abroad experience. Ad
justing BOSP could help students
have an even better experience
abroad while also breaking down
some of the economic barriers that
still exist.

In most ways my time studying
abroad in Japan has been very
positive. But while Stanford has
eliminated the physical barrier for
lower-income individuals to study
abroad, the expensive spending cul
ture prevalent in many study
abroad programs remains in Stan
ford's. Simple remedies do exist
that could mitigate this, though.
At other schools, study abroad
can be much more expensive than
studying on campus. Living can
cost more, people eat out for meals
more frequently and then there are
costs incurred by commuting to
class. As a result, study abroad
often has a reputation of elitism as
sociated with it: Rich individuals go
abroad for a term to essentially
take a vacation for a semester, trav
eling around Europe with a much
lighter course load.
I've personally observed many
students who studied abroad for a
full year and came back no better at
the foreign language they went
abroad to learn than before they
left quite counter to the purpose
of going abroad. Granted, it might
be more difficult to become fluent in
a language while studying these
days since that English is more
common abroad, but the result is
still not what one should expect.

This is in stark contrast with
Stanford's Bing Overseas Studies
Program (BOSP). Stanford's pro
gram, thanks in large part to the
generosity of Peter and Helen Bing,
allows students who want to study
abroad to simply pay their normal
tuition to Stanford. This means that
students on financial aid pay the
same amount to study abroad as
they would to study on campus.
Furthermore, housing and food
fees tend to be cheaper abroad than
on campus, a benefit of not being on
the meal plan. Including the price of
my airfare to and from Japan, I ac
tually spend less money for school
during my term abroad in Kyoto
than I would at Stanford. There are
many reasons that about 50 percent
of each Stanford graduating class
studies abroad (and the percentage
is still growing), but one of them is
certainly the economic accessibility
of BOSP

While Stanford makes study
abroad less expensive for low-in
come students, the history of study
abroad and the culture associated
with it from other schools still pres
sures students to spend. For exam
ple, while fairly cheap, travel costs
in Kyoto, Japan where I study
add up quickly. If one wants to go
to a shrine (a key and wonderful
feature of Kyoto's culture that
makes it the home of many World
Heritage Sites), a round trip usual
ly costs $5 to $lO, entrance fees are
about the same and lunch and din
ner will add another $l5 or so. Cu
mulatively, you might spend $25 in a
day. Although the sights are all
worth it, when you live in a city with
hundreds of places worth seeing,
spending around $2O a day can be
come $2OO in less than a month
and this is just for the essential
parts of study abroad. If you add in
drinking parties, travel to nearby
cities with more history and more
to see or even just essential costs
like buying a phone for emergen
cies, the cost goes up even more.
This need to travel certainly ex
ists in other programs, too. While
