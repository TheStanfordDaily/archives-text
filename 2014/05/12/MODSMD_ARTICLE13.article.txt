### Lily Zheng 
Whether or not you like the
word "feminism," ideas re
garding men, women,
equality and justice are spoken, un
derstood and discussed here on
Stanford's campus. It's important,
for example, that women speak up
for themselves and empower them
selves; it's important that men un
derstand masculinity and under
stand that it isn't an iron cage; it's im
portant that we as Stanford students
understand the gendered world we
live in.

All well and good but at first
look, that doesn't match up at all to
what I do on my Friday nights.
How can I, as a confident, assured
and healthy woman at Stanford,
keep being my kinky self and main
tain my dignity? When I'm submis
sive during a scene say I'm pas
sively letting my wrists get cuffed to
a St. Andrew's Cross or eagerly
obeying commands —am I doing
things that I should feel ashamed of,
things that would make me a "bad
feminist?"

In the late '9os, feminist writers
seemed to think so. The idea that any
action or interaction that even
looked like it replicated male-over
female power structures in real life
was inherently bad or anti-feminist
was a very loud idea indeed, especial
ly in the context of the revolution in
women's rights. Any man in power,
any woman in submission: These all
seemed to be hostile and threatening
ideas that needed to be fought with
angry voices and pointed literature.
But I'm a feminist too. It was
surprising at first when I realized
that the things I do don't make me

feel guilty in the slightest.
Outside of the San Francisco
Citadel, we're all just people walking
down on a city street at night. Of
course, most of us are excited to get
there and have detailed plans of what
we will do once inside. Yet, there are
rules. The second we walk in, howev
er liberating or wonderful that may
be, you don't see the orderly line of
kinky people paying for their ticket
instantly devolve into a dominatrix
laden, naked flogger-fest orgy. I
would pay extra to see that, if it hap
pened but the kink community is
not lawless. That doesn't happen.
We describe many of the interac
tions between each other as "play."
Knife play, pet play, temperature
play, impact play notice the differ
ence between these and "assault,"
"bestiality," "fire and arson" or
"physical abuse." Play has to be ne
gotiated, organized and arranged by
a consenting individual or individuals
in away that establishes the pre
ferred power dynamic, hard and soft
limits, likes, dislikes, honorifics.
Everything. We need to share our
desires, the things we avoid, the hes
itation we might have. We're people,
after all when men need reassur
ing that their dominance in the one
hour scene doesn't make them "a
bad, sexist man" and women need re
assuring that their submission does
n't make them "a woman-hating anti
feminist," that's when negotiation
does its job and resolves those con
flicts. So much of kink is just play,
after all.

Nobody is saying for a second
that play is real life. When Tybalt
kills Mercutio in Shakespeare's

Romeo and Juliet, panicked the
ater-goers don't hurriedly call 9-1-1
and trample each other in them haste
to distance themselves from the
crazed murderer. They're watching
a play, not a murder. In exactly the
same way, the cries of "yes sir" and
"yes, mistress," the ropes and cuffs,
the floggers and riding crops that I
play with are seen as just that: play.

I have zero tolerance for when
people don't follow these rules. Im
pact play without consent is abuse.
Humiliation without consent is ha
rassment. Polyamory without con
sent is cheating.
I got a message from FetLife, a
kinky social networking site, just last
month that sounded like it had been
written by a drunken high school
junior. The sender was rude, arro
gant and commented about my body
like it was a commodity that he had
rights to by sheer virtue of having
26/ Male/dominant on the top of his
profile page. When I told him that we
hadn't agreed on any dynamic that
could have possibly explained or ex
cused the way he was talking to me,
he seemed generally surprised.
"But... don't you like being domi
nated?" he asked, and I couldn't help
thinking that this kid didn't under
stand what the culture of the kink
community was actually like.
When I can actually negotiate
submission, though, it's so much dif
ferent. When I have the ability to dic
tate whether or not I want the flog
ger in my hand or the flogger on my
back, their nails on my skin or mine
on theirs, it makes kink out in my
mind to be the very opposite of an
anti-feminist thing. Rather, it feels
empowering. It's the choice that
makes it for me the knowledge
that the dynamic is in place because,
while negotiating in another room
with another person as two individu
als on an equal footing, I decided that
I wanted this.
As a woman in the kink communi
ty, I can get what I want and what I
desire, whether or not that want is
for dominance or submission. Nei
ther the people in the community nor
the institutions that support it stop
my efforts. There is no unspoken
rule floating in the air stating that
women should be this way or that
way.
That's the biggest reason why, as
I help my partner adjust the leather
cuffs around my wrists, my inner
feminist my inner feminist sits back,
relaxes, and enjoys the show.

pened but the kink community is

We describe many of the interac
tions between each other as "play."
Knife play, pet play, temperature
play, impact play notice the differ
ence between these and "assault,"
"bestiality," "fire and arson" or
"physical abuse." Play has to be ne
gotiated, organized and arranged by
a consenting individual or individuals
in away that establishes the pre
ferred power dynamic, hard and soft
limits, likes, dislikes, honorifics.
Everything. We need to share our
desires, the things we avoid, the hes
itation we might have. We're people,
after all when men need reassur
ing that their dominance in the one
hour scene doesn't make them "a
bad, sexist man" and women need re
assuring that their submission does
n't make them "a woman-hating anti
feminist," that's when negotiation
does its job and resolves those con
flicts. So much of kink is just play,
after all.

Nobody is saying for a second
that play is real life. When Tybalt
kills Mercutio in Shakespeare's

Romeo and Juliet, panicked the
ater-goers don't hurriedly call 9-1-1
and trample each other in them haste
to distance themselves from the
crazed murderer. They're watching
a play, not a murder. In exactly the
same way, the cries of "yes sir" and
"yes, mistress," the ropes and cuffs,
the floggers and riding crops that I
play with are seen as just that: play.

I have zero tolerance for when
people don't follow these rules. Im
pact play without consent is abuse.
Humiliation without consent is ha
rassment. Polyamory without con
sent is cheating.
I got a message from FetLife, a
kinky social networking site, just last
month that sounded like it had been
written by a drunken high school
junior. The sender was rude, arro
gant and commented about my body
like it was a commodity that he had
rights to by sheer virtue of having
26/ Male/dominant on the top of his
profile page. When I told him that we
hadn't agreed on any dynamic that
could have possibly explained or ex
cused the way he was talking to me,
he seemed generally surprised.
"But... don't you like being domi
nated?" he asked, and I couldn't help
thinking that this kid didn't under
stand what the culture of the kink
community was actually like.
When I can actually negotiate
submission, though, it's so much dif
ferent. When I have the ability to dic
tate whether or not I want the flog
ger in my hand or the flogger on my
back, their nails on my skin or mine
on theirs, it makes kink out in my
mind to be the very opposite of an
anti-feminist thing. Rather, it feels
empowering. It's the choice that
makes it for me the knowledge
that the dynamic is in place because,
while negotiating in another room
with another person as two individu
als on an equal footing, I decided that
I wanted this.
As a woman in the kink communi
ty, I can get what I want and what I
desire, whether or not that want is
for dominance or submission. Nei
ther the people in the community nor
the institutions that support it stop
my efforts. There is no unspoken
rule floating in the air stating that
women should be this way or that
way.
That's the biggest reason why, as
I help my partner adjust the leather
cuffs around my wrists, my inner
feminist my inner feminist sits back,
relaxes, and enjoys the show.

Whether or not you like the
word "feminism," ideas re
garding men, women,
equality and justice are spoken, un
derstood and discussed here on
Stanford's campus. It's important,
for example, that women speak up
for themselves and empower them
selves; it's important that men un
derstand masculinity and under
stand that it isn't an iron cage; it's im
portant that we as Stanford students
understand the gendered world we
live in.

All well and good but at first
look, that doesn't match up at all to
what I do on my Friday nights.
How can I, as a confident, assured
and healthy woman at Stanford,
keep being my kinky self and main
tain my dignity? When I'm submis
sive during a scene say I'm pas
sively letting my wrists get cuffed to
a St. Andrew's Cross or eagerly
obeying commands —am I doing
things that I should feel ashamed of,
things that would make me a "bad
feminist?"

In the late '9os, feminist writers
seemed to think so. The idea that any
action or interaction that even
looked like it replicated male-over
female power structures in real life
was inherently bad or anti-feminist
was a very loud idea indeed, especial
ly in the context of the revolution in
women's rights. Any man in power,
any woman in submission: These all
seemed to be hostile and threatening
ideas that needed to be fought with
angry voices and pointed literature.
But I'm a feminist too. It was
surprising at first when I realized
that the things I do don't make me

feel guilty in the slightest.
Outside of the San Francisco
Citadel, we're all just people walking
down on a city street at night. Of
course, most of us are excited to get
there and have detailed plans of what
we will do once inside. Yet, there are
rules. The second we walk in, howev
er liberating or wonderful that may
be, you don't see the orderly line of
kinky people paying for their ticket
instantly devolve into a dominatrix
laden, naked flogger-fest orgy. I
would pay extra to see that, if it hap
pened but the kink community is
not lawless. That doesn't happen.
