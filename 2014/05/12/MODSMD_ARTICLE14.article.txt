# TOUGH DAY IN WACO
## 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
Saturday brought a certain
amount of deja vu for Stanford
men's tennis.
Unfortunately for the No. 27
Cardinal, that feeling of history re
peating itself didn't bode well for
them. For its second straight outing,
the team was ousted by a lower
seeded opponent in its first match of
a tournament, as Stanford (14-6,5-2
Pac-12) followed up a tough 4-2 loss
to No. 49 Oregon in the Pac-12 Tour
nament with a 4-2 loss in the first
round of the NCAA Tournament
over the weekend, this time to No.
43 Tulsa (16-12, 0-0 Conference
USA).

"A bounce here, a bounce there,
things could have been a little differ
ent in our last two matches," head
coach John Whitlinger said. "But
I've got to give credit to Tulsa where
credit is due. They did a really good
job [Saturday]. But again, it was a
great effort from our guys. I'm real
ly proud of them."
The loss was eerily reminiscent
of the loss to the Ducks that
knocked the Cardinal out of the con
ference tournament, as the match
again followed the pattern of Stan
ford jumping out to a quick lead by
clinching the doubles point and get
ting a fast singles win on the back
courts before relinquishing a furi

ous comeback from its opponents.
The doubles pairing of senior
Jamin Ball and junior John Morris
sey got out to a fast start for the
Cardinal and easily handled fifth
year senior Clifford Marsland and
sophomore Dylan McCloskey
the 27th-ranked doubles pair in the
country by a score of 8-2. In his
return from an injury that kept him
sidelined for most of the end of the
season, sophomore Maciek Ro
manowicz paired up with sopho
more Trey Strobel for an 8-6 win on
court three to net the Cardinal an
early 1-0 lead.
And this time, it was junior
Robert Stineman that got the quick
singles victory for the Cardinal,
with an efficient 6-1, 6-1 victory on
court six that put Stanford up 2-0.
However, that would prove to be
just about all that went right for
Stanford in the singles rounds.
"Again, it was almost a carbon
copy of the Oregon match,"
Whitlinger said. "Win the doubles
point and have some opportunities.
We didn't win four first sets this
time they came out and were
playing strong but we had
chances in third sets, chances all
over the place. [Daniel] Ho served
for the first set, Trey Strobel served
for the first set, Anthony Tsodikov
served for the match ... we just
couldn't get it done. They battled,
our guys battled, and they just came
out on top."
Although Morrissey won his
first set on court one in a ranked
battle between the 118th-ranked
Morrissey and the 74th-ranked
Marsland, he lost his grip on the

match after the first set and surren
dered a pair of quick 6-2 losses to
get the push back for Tulsa started.
That was quickly followed up by
a straight-set loss for Ho, who lost a
heartbr eaker in the last match of his
Stanford career by coming tantaliz
ingly close to winning both of his
sets before dropping both in back
and-forth tiebreakers. The final
score of 7-6 (5), 7-6 (5) was represen
tative of how hard he fought before

ultimately dropping both of his sets.
Strobel and Tsodikov rounded
out the match for the Cardinal by
dropping both of their matches
after tough three-set marathons.
Although Tsodikov had served for
the match in his third set, he al
lowed McCloskey, his opponent, to
claw back into the match and ulti
mately win in a tiebreak to clinch
the Golden Hurricane's berth in the
round of 32.

"It's hard to put a finger on it,"
Whitlinger said. "They just couldn't
quite convert the big points in the
big games when we needed to in the
last couple of matches. During the
year, we were fortunate enough to
be able to do that. I'm not going to
say the odds caught up with us, but
we were fortunate in winning some
of our matches earlier, and we were

Junior Robert Stineman (above) was the only player that saw success in the singles portion of Stanford's tough
NCAA first-round loss to Tulsa with his 6-1, 6-1 victory that spurred the Cardinal to an early 2-0 lead. The
Cardinal were ultimately unable to hold that lead, dropping four consecutive matches to lose 4-2.
a little bit unfortunate in los
ing these two the last two
matches we played. We were
in a position to win, and we
just couldn't quite get it
done."
The loss rounded out a
season for Stanford that ex
ceeded the expectations of
many, particularly in the face
of many of the injuries that
the team had to face
throughout the season. Not
only did the loss of Ro
manowicz for one of the
toughest stretches of the
season put the doubles and
singles lineups into flux and

give the players uncertainty
as to the structure of the
team down the stretch,
"For what they've gone
through all season through
long and what they've bat
tled through they battled
through injuries this sea
son has been remarkable,"
Whitlinger said. "Roy Led
erman, a freshman, didn't
play all year. Maciek was out
a lot of the year. Nobody bat
ted an eye. Everybody
stepped up, and when their
name was called, they were
ready to play."

And it was a remarkable
season indeed for a young
team that handled all of the
uncertainty with aplomb and
really grew together into a
tight unit that won 11 of its
final 13 regular-season

matches and compiled a 14-4
regular-season record.
When next season comes
around and most of the Car
dinal's key contributors will
return with this experience
under their belts with
what they hope will be more
consistency in their lineup
they will look to be the
core for a team that again
makes a special run into the
postseason.
"I was really proud of
how they handled all of the
adversity that came our way
they handled it pretty
darn well," Whitlinger said.
"They'll be better for it come
next year... as a coach, I
couldn't be more proud."
