# HEAVENLY IN THE CITY OF ANGELS
## WOMEN'S WATER POLO CLAIMS THIRD TITLE IN FOUR YEARS 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
Forget UCLA. Forget USC. For
get the rest of the MPSF confer
ence. Forget the idea that Stanford
women's water polo could be felled
for a second time this season.
Because on Sunday afternoon at
the Uytengsu Aquatic Center in Los
Angeles, there was simply no team
in the country that could have
matched up with the No. 1 Cardinal
in the pool not even No. 2 UCLA
as Stanford brought home the
fourth national championship in the
program's history.
"We've had wins before, but it
wasn't going to mean anything un
less we took them apart today," said
senior Kaley Dodson, who scored
two goals. "I'm super proud of
everyone's performance. I was
thinking about today, all the wins in
the last three and three-quarters of

a year wouldn't have mattered if we
hadn't won."
As the season progressed, the ul
timate matchup between the No. 1
Cardinal (25-1) and No. 2 Bruins (27-
5) for all the marbles had almost be
come a foregone conclusion. Al
though it had been the fearsome
USC Trojans that had started the
season ranked as the top team in the
country after slipping past Stanford
in a 10-9, quadruple-overtime heart
breaker in last season's national title
match, Stanford and UCLA firmly
established themselves at the top of
the pack towards the end of the sea
son.
It was the fifth matchup of the
year between the two teams, with
UCLA having won the first to hand
Stanford its only loss of the season
before the Cardinal won the next
three including a 6-5 nail biter in
the MPSF title match. Although
Stanford had the advantage in

record, not many expected the win
to come easily, as had been the case
in the teams' previous three meet
ings.
"This championship game, in my
mind, started in February with the
loss to UCLA," Stanford head coach
John Tanner said. "We owe them a
lot for forcing us to get better. They

are a terrific team and they showed
up big-time today."
As has been the case throughout
the season, defense was the Cardi
nal's calling card that ultimately net
ted them the trophy. Although the
team as a whole including the de
fense started slowly and fell be
hind early, Stanford became ab

solutely airtight throughout the sec
ond half and gave UCLA no oppor
tunities whatsoever to regain its
footing as the Cardinal roared back
into the match with seven unan
swered goals.
"I'm really proud of this team,"
