# SPEAKERS & EVENTS
## TEDx Stanford draws crowds 
### JULIA TURAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Over 700 people from Stanford and the
surrounding community gathered on Satur
day for the third annual TEDx Stanford con
ference. The event featured 31 speakers and
performers including a student profession
al racecar driver, one of the world's leading ex
perts on climate change and Stanford alumni
musicians.
The daylong event aimed to take the audi
ence "above and beyond," both inside Cemex
Auditorium during the event and after the

conference. Like other TEDx events, TEDx
Stanford followed the model of the independ
ently organized and non-profit TED confer
ences.
According to Melinda Sacks '74, producer
of the conference and director of media initia
tives for the Office of Public Affairs, this
year's conference sold out in a record 14 min
utes.
"The student team worked hard to distrib
ute fliers to every corner of campus," she said.
However, Sacks also explained that the
high-profile conference did not
need much publicity. Sacks decided
to focus more heavily on arts and
humanities, mirroring "Stanford's
art explosion."
Stanford's Talisman a cappella
group opened the conference with a
vocal performance. The group is
dedicated to storytelling through
music, and their surprisingly up
beat song was a Zulu funeral song
that they learned from housekeep
ers they met while travelling in
South Africa.
Steps to saving our planet
Director of Stanford's Hopkins
Marine Station, Stephen Palumbi,
spoke about the extreme creatures
of the sea, explaining that bowhead
whales can be over 110 years old and
black coral is the record-holder with
a life expectancy of over 4,270 years.
Palumbi believes that under
standing these extreme creatures

will motivate others to save the
planet from further climate disrup
tions and species extinctions.
Later in the session, climate
change expert and Stanford Associ
ate Professor Noah Diffenbaugh
explained the different implications
of a four degree Celsius versus a
two degree Celsius rise in the
Earth's temperature by 2100.
"I believe we can create a world
where every person has access to
the same level of well-being I enjoy
and still preserve our climate sys
tem," Diffenbaugh said.
Class of 2014 makes appearances
Representing the graduating
Class of 2014 were Julia Landauer
'l4, Jessica Anderson 'l4 and Tay
lor Kinney 'l4.
Landauer, who started racing
go-carts at the age of 10, has risen
to the ranks as a professional
NASCAR driver. She spoke about
how biology does not prevent men
and women from competing togeth
er in races. However, she believes
that girls in today's society are
taught not to push themselves, not
to fall and not to pick themselves

back up.
"Racing is not scary for me,"
Landauer said. "Breaking cen
turies of negative stereotypes of
women is scary, but so important."
Anderson's original musical
"High Ground" debuted at Stan
ford two months ago. The TEDx
Stanford audience saw a short,
powerful scene from the piece that
was set in the antebellum south.
The musical showed how gospel
music helps forge a community.
"Sometimes I feel like a mother
less child ... a long way from home,"
the actors sang in their roles as
slaves.
Anderson completed the entire
musical in one year and explained
that she hopes to take it to theaters
outside Stanford.
Also representing the perform
ing arts was ballroom dancer Kin
ney. She and her partner Daniel
Lee Tran are the undefeated Unit
ed States Amateur Ballroom
Champions. They performed on
stage at the event, and despite
working on a stage much smaller
than what they were accustomed
to, made moves that required sheer

strength look effortless.
Science above and beyond
"We're just a biological specula
tion/Sittin' here, vibratin'/And we
don't know what we're vibratin'
about," sang founder of Stanford's
bioengineering major and assistant
professor of bioengineering Drew
Endy.
Endy also spoke about his cur
rent research.
"Evolution is not selecting for
systems that are easy to under
stand," he said in an interview to
The Daily after the conference.
To avoid this problem, Endy
works to "design and build living
organisms to solve problems,"
rather than relying on existing sys
tems. In his talk, he showed the au
dience a pine cone he had picked up
on his way to the event. He ex
plained that his current project
works to reprogram the pine tree to
grow computer chips.
While Endy is innovating on the
DNA level, Debbie Bard, research
associate at the Kavli Institute for
Particle Astrophysics and Cosmol
ogy, aimed to expand the audience's

knowledge of the universe.
Upon taking a "census of the
universe," researchers found that
galaxies are not evenly distributed,
she explained. While the Hubble
can stare at the same patch of sky
for a long time, using it to examine
the universe is like trying to "light
up a room with a laser pointer."
The telescope that Bard is help
ing to build is a "cosmic excavator."
Called the large synaptic survey
telescope, it sits on a mountaintop
in Chile with predictable weather.
It has the biggest digital camera
the world has ever seen, with 500
times more pixels than an iPhone.

women is scary, but so important."
Anderson's original musical
"High Ground" debuted at Stan
ford two months ago. The TEDx
Stanford audience saw a short,
powerful scene from the piece that
was set in the antebellum south.
The musical showed how gospel
music helps forge a community.
"Sometimes I feel like a mother
less child ... a long way from home,"
the actors sang in their roles as
slaves.
Anderson completed the entire
musical in one year and explained
that she hopes to take it to theaters
outside Stanford.
Also representing the perform
ing arts was ballroom dancer Kin
ney. She and her partner Daniel
Lee Tran are the undefeated Unit
ed States Amateur Ballroom
Champions. They performed on
stage at the event, and despite
working on a stage much smaller
than what they were accustomed
to, made moves that required sheer

strength look effortless.
Science above and beyond
"We're just a biological specula
tion/Sittin' here, vibratin'/And we
don't know what we're vibratin'
about," sang founder of Stanford's
bioengineering major and assistant
professor of bioengineering Drew
Endy.
Endy also spoke about his cur
rent research.
"Evolution is not selecting for
systems that are easy to under
stand," he said in an interview to
The Daily after the conference.
To avoid this problem, Endy
works to "design and build living
organisms to solve problems,"
rather than relying on existing sys
tems. In his talk, he showed the au
dience a pine cone he had picked up
on his way to the event. He ex
plained that his current project
works to reprogram the pine tree to
grow computer chips.
While Endy is innovating on the
DNA level, Debbie Bard, research
associate at the Kavli Institute for
Particle Astrophysics and Cosmol
ogy, aimed to expand the audience's

knowledge of the universe.
Upon taking a "census of the
universe," researchers found that
galaxies are not evenly distributed,
she explained. While the Hubble
can stare at the same patch of sky
for a long time, using it to examine
the universe is like trying to "light
up a room with a laser pointer."
The telescope that Bard is help
ing to build is a "cosmic excavator."
Called the large synaptic survey
telescope, it sits on a mountaintop
in Chile with predictable weather.
It has the biggest digital camera
the world has ever seen, with 500
times more pixels than an iPhone.

Over 700 people from Stanford and the
surrounding community gathered on Satur
day for the third annual TEDx Stanford con
ference. The event featured 31 speakers and
performers including a student profession
al racecar driver, one of the world's leading ex
perts on climate change and Stanford alumni
musicians.
The daylong event aimed to take the audi
ence "above and beyond," both inside Cemex
Auditorium during the event and after the

conference. Like other TEDx events, TEDx
Stanford followed the model of the independ
ently organized and non-profit TED confer
ences.
According to Melinda Sacks '74, producer
of the conference and director of media initia
tives for the Office of Public Affairs, this
year's conference sold out in a record 14 min
utes.
"The student team worked hard to distrib
ute fliers to every corner of campus," she said.
However, Sacks also explained that the
high-profile conference did not
need much publicity. Sacks decided
to focus more heavily on arts and
humanities, mirroring "Stanford's
art explosion."
Stanford's Talisman a cappella
group opened the conference with a
vocal performance. The group is
dedicated to storytelling through
music, and their surprisingly up
beat song was a Zulu funeral song
that they learned from housekeep
ers they met while travelling in
South Africa.
Steps to saving our planet
Director of Stanford's Hopkins
Marine Station, Stephen Palumbi,
spoke about the extreme creatures
of the sea, explaining that bowhead
whales can be over 110 years old and
black coral is the record-holder with
a life expectancy of over 4,270 years.
Palumbi believes that under
standing these extreme creatures

will motivate others to save the
planet from further climate disrup
tions and species extinctions.
Later in the session, climate
change expert and Stanford Associ
ate Professor Noah Diffenbaugh
explained the different implications
of a four degree Celsius versus a
two degree Celsius rise in the
Earth's temperature by 2100.
"I believe we can create a world
where every person has access to
the same level of well-being I enjoy
and still preserve our climate sys
tem," Diffenbaugh said.
Class of 2014 makes appearances
Representing the graduating
Class of 2014 were Julia Landauer
'l4, Jessica Anderson 'l4 and Tay
lor Kinney 'l4.
Landauer, who started racing
go-carts at the age of 10, has risen
to the ranks as a professional
NASCAR driver. She spoke about
how biology does not prevent men
and women from competing togeth
er in races. However, she believes
that girls in today's society are
taught not to push themselves, not
to fall and not to pick themselves

back up.
"Racing is not scary for me,"
Landauer said. "Breaking cen
turies of negative stereotypes of
women is scary, but so important."
