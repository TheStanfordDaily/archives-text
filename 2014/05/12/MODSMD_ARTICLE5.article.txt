# Students protest at Obama speech
## Demonstrators support worker rights, higher wages 
### ANDREW VOGELEY DESK EDITOR 
On Friday, about 20 Stanford joined a
group of 300 people demonstrating on various
issues centered mainly on worker wages
and working conditions, as well as the grow
ing income inequality in America outside of
the Mountain View Wal-Mart where Presi
dent Obama was giving a private speech about
climate change.
Students from several groups on campus,
including First-Generation Low Income Part
nership (FLIP), Pilipino American Student
Union (PASU) and Movimiento Estudiantil
Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA), met at the Wal-
Mart in the morning after getting in contact
with organizers from the Organization United
for Respect at Walmart (OUR Walmart), a
non-profit organization that had taken part in
the demonstration.
"We were encouraging people to wear
Stanford attire," said Sammie Wills 'l6, who
helped coordinate students for the event.
"Usually in demonstrations it's the same nar

rative with low-wage workers, and the public
loses interest in hearing the same thing over
and over again. As Stanford students, we
should use our privilege to bring awareness to
these issues."
Despite the fact that the President's exclu
sive speech was held inside the store, demon
strators marched through adjacent parking
lots and around the blockaded Wal-Mart
parking lot. The blockades prevented protest
ers from getting within shouting distance of
the storefront or the President.
"Even if Obama didn't directly talk to the
protestors and demonstrators, it's really valu
able to make sure that the voice of Wal-Mart
workers is reflected for example in press
coverage of the event and reflected in the
experience of the people that went to see
Obama," said Emma Hartung 'l7, a member
of Stanford's Student and Labor Alliance
(SALA) who had attended the morning
demonstration. "We must keep the message
coming that people do care about these issues

and that people will hold
Obama accountable to his
words about income equali
ty."
Demonstrators also criti
cized the President for
choosing to highlight Wal-
Mart as an example of corpo
rations that emphasize sus
tainability and alternative
energy. The President's
speech announced 300 public
and private sector commit
ments to increase the use of
alternative energies.
Some demonstrators sug

gested that Wal-Mart's sus
tainability record was less
than stellar. Ultimately,
though, the protesters' main
aim was to stand with the
workers of Wal-Mart.
"I wanted to help show
solidarity for low-wage work
ers outside of the Stanford
community," Hartung said.
"And I think it was a really
good opportunity for us to
show our support and soli
darity for folks working to
improve working conditions
in the Bay Area and national
ly."
Wills said that she was
pleased with the Stanford
turnout and expected further
Stanford involvement in the
surrounding community.

"I sent out this email on
Wednesday night, and it was
amazing that we were able to
gather that many people in
that amount of time," Wills
said. "People always com
plain about the Stanford bub
ble but there's always oppor
tunities to go off campus ...
and there's a diversity of low
income communities to get
involved with. [Going to
protest at Wal-Mart] is a
great show of that and hope
fully people build off of that
momentum."
