### ZHENG YUAN MA 
Maxine Hong Kingston,
award-winning author and
senior lecturer for creative
writing at the University of
California, Berkeley, spoke at
Stanford on Friday as the
ninth annual Kieve Distin
guished Speaker, a lecture
held by the Center for Com
parative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity (CCSRE).
Kingston's books have
covered topics from anthro
pology to education to
women's studies. She is con
sidered one of the founding
writers of Asian-American
literature and won the 1980
National Book Award for her
book "China Men" and the
1976 National Book Critics
Circle Award for "The
Woman Warrior."

According to the Modern
Literature Association, "The
Woman Warrior" is the most
commonly taught text at uni
versities.
"Maxine defined for a lot
of our generation what it
meant to be Asian Ameri
can," said Jeff Chang, execu
tive director for the Institute
for Diversity in the Arts +
Committee on Black Per
forming Arts at Stanford.
"She's left a lasting legacy by
writing us into history."
He also emphasized that
Kingston is gifted in human
izing the stories of immi
grants and human struggles
in general.
"She's a brilliant writer
and doesn't shy away from
hard issues," he added.
Close to 100 audience
members came to listen to
Kingston read three excerpts
from her books. One of the
excerpts from "China Men"

told of her Chinese immi
grant grandfather who was
sent to work on the Transcon
tinental Railroad. The story
described how he had never
seen snow or the immovable
mountains before coming to
the United States and how he
would also soon appraise how
hard it was to move earth.
She also spoke about her
family history, including the
inspiring story of how her fa
ther, an illegal immigrant,
tried to enter the New York
harbor and was deported on
three attempts before he fi
nally entered the country
with his wife.
"We'd always thought
we'd be deported!" Kingston
said with a laugh.
When asked her biggest
literary inspirations,
Kingston cited Virginia Woolf
and the traditions of African-
American writers before her.
Director of the CCSRE
and Professor of Compara
tive Literature Jose David
Saldivar spoke about what
makes Kingston's work so
distinctive and why the de
partment chose her as a
speaker.
"All of Kingston's texts
are radical experiments in
genre both 'The Woman
Warrior' and 'China Men' are
autobiographies that cross
freely into the imaginative
worlds of extravagance, myth
and fiction," he said in a state
ment to The Daily.
"Kingston offered read
ers an alternate radical vision
of the founding fathers of
America ... [by making]
founding fathers of the Chi
nese men whose labor
cleared jungles to create
sugar plantations and who
hammered through moun
tains to make way for the
Transcontinental Railroad,"
he added.
Mar Yam Hamedami
Ph.D. 'OB, associate director
of the CCSRE, spoke about

her first experiences reading
Kingston.
"Like many, I first read
'The Woman Warrior' in col
lege and like many Ameri
cans who are children of im
migrants and who come from
non-white racial and ethnic
backgrounds I was blown
away by this amazing artist
who told stories that were
more like my stories than
most authors in the 'Western
canon' that I had read up until
that point," Hamedani said.
In addition to the event
organizers, audience mem
bers also had positive com
ments about Kingston's lec
ture.
"[Kingston's work] gave
me a lot of words to describe
attitudes I had felt but have
never been able to articu
late," said Xiaoxia Zhuang
M.A. 'l5. "It was very inspir
ing to read a narrative by a
fellow woman of color. Her
work was really a gateway for
me into the Asian-American
literature."
Aspiring writer Mirae Lee
'l7 appreciated Kingston's
memorable depiction of racial
barriers.
"She really expressed
well that block that was there
when you're a person of color,
especially in that day," Lee
said. "It was an image that
particularly struck me be
cause I could imagine
[Kingston's grandfather]
with a pickaxe trying to
break through that block of
granite."
Lee also said that the
event gave her the opportuni
ty to meet a fellow Asian-
American female author.

"Walking out of the event,
I felt like I had a long way to
go, but I also felt that energy
to go that distance," Lee said.
"It was mixed feelings, but in
a good way."

American writers before her.
Director of the CCSRE
and Professor of Compara
tive Literature Jose David
Saldivar spoke about what
makes Kingston's work so
distinctive and why the de
partment chose her as a
speaker.
"All of Kingston's texts
are radical experiments in
genre both 'The Woman
Warrior' and 'China Men' are
autobiographies that cross
freely into the imaginative
worlds of extravagance, myth
and fiction," he said in a state
ment to The Daily.
"Kingston offered read
ers an alternate radical vision
of the founding fathers of
America ... [by making]
founding fathers of the Chi
nese men whose labor
cleared jungles to create
sugar plantations and who
hammered through moun
tains to make way for the
Transcontinental Railroad,"
he added.
Mar Yam Hamedami
Ph.D. 'OB, associate director
of the CCSRE, spoke about

her first experiences reading
Kingston.
"Like many, I first read
'The Woman Warrior' in col
lege and like many Ameri
cans who are children of im
migrants and who come from
non-white racial and ethnic
backgrounds I was blown
away by this amazing artist
who told stories that were
more like my stories than
most authors in the 'Western
canon' that I had read up until
that point," Hamedani said.
In addition to the event
organizers, audience mem
bers also had positive com
ments about Kingston's lec
ture.
"[Kingston's work] gave
me a lot of words to describe
attitudes I had felt but have
never been able to articu
late," said Xiaoxia Zhuang
M.A. 'l5. "It was very inspir
ing to read a narrative by a
fellow woman of color. Her
work was really a gateway for
me into the Asian-American
literature."
Aspiring writer Mirae Lee
'l7 appreciated Kingston's
memorable depiction of racial
barriers.
"She really expressed
well that block that was there
when you're a person of color,
especially in that day," Lee
said. "It was an image that
particularly struck me be
cause I could imagine
[Kingston's grandfather]
with a pickaxe trying to
break through that block of
granite."
Lee also said that the
event gave her the opportuni
ty to meet a fellow Asian-
American female author.

"Walking out of the event,
I felt like I had a long way to
go, but I also felt that energy
to go that distance," Lee said.
"It was mixed feelings, but in
a good way."

Maxine Hong Kingston,
award-winning author and
senior lecturer for creative
writing at the University of
California, Berkeley, spoke at
Stanford on Friday as the
ninth annual Kieve Distin
guished Speaker, a lecture
held by the Center for Com
parative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity (CCSRE).
Kingston's books have
covered topics from anthro
pology to education to
women's studies. She is con
sidered one of the founding
writers of Asian-American
literature and won the 1980
National Book Award for her
book "China Men" and the
1976 National Book Critics
Circle Award for "The
Woman Warrior."

According to the Modern
Literature Association, "The
Woman Warrior" is the most
commonly taught text at uni
versities.
"Maxine defined for a lot
of our generation what it
meant to be Asian Ameri
can," said Jeff Chang, execu
tive director for the Institute
for Diversity in the Arts +
Committee on Black Per
forming Arts at Stanford.
"She's left a lasting legacy by
writing us into history."
He also emphasized that
Kingston is gifted in human
izing the stories of immi
grants and human struggles
in general.
"She's a brilliant writer
and doesn't shy away from
hard issues," he added.
Close to 100 audience
members came to listen to
Kingston read three excerpts
from her books. One of the
excerpts from "China Men"

told of her Chinese immi
grant grandfather who was
sent to work on the Transcon
tinental Railroad. The story
described how he had never
seen snow or the immovable
mountains before coming to
the United States and how he
would also soon appraise how
hard it was to move earth.
She also spoke about her
family history, including the
inspiring story of how her fa
ther, an illegal immigrant,
tried to enter the New York
harbor and was deported on
three attempts before he fi
nally entered the country
with his wife.
"We'd always thought
we'd be deported!" Kingston
said with a laugh.
When asked her biggest
literary inspirations,
Kingston cited Virginia Woolf
and the traditions of African-
American writers before her.
