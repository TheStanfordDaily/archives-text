## Potential for this year's World Cup is incredible 
### Michael Peterson 
Twenty years can certainly
change a lot in sports. Flash
back 20 years from today
and the United States
men's soccer team had
never qualified for more than two
World Cups in a row. In fact, prior to
1994, the United States only made
four of the 14 World Cups.
After losing in the group stage in
1950, the United States failed to reach
the World Cup again until 1990, when
three losses including a humiliat
ing 5-1 defeat to Czechoslovakia
quickly saw it out the door.
However, when the United States
hosted the men's World Cup in 1994,
everything changed. The national
team beat Colombia for the first
time in history and battled Brazil,
the eventual champion, admirably
for 90 minutes. Soccer, previously
lacking real popularity in the scene
of American sports, gained a whole
new generation of fans in the United
States. Over 68,000 fans on average
showed up to every game, still a
World Cup record by over 16,000.
Fast-forward to today and soc
cer's popularity in America, and the
skill level of the United States men's
national team is arguably at the
highest it has ever been. Major
League Soccer is the fastest rising
sport in popularity in America. Sim
ilarly, the men's national team has
qualified for seven straight World
Cups, including three appearances
in the knockout stages. In 2013, the
United States men's national team
recorded 16 wins, including victo
ries over Germany (albeit the "B"
squad), Bosnia-Herzegovina and
Mexico, to finish the best calendar
year in its history in terms of both
wins and winning percentage. For
mer world-class player and new
coach Jurgen Klinsmann has
brought winning expectations and
mentality to a historically mediocre
soccer nation.
This World Cup just might be the
most important one in history for
soccer in the United States, as fel
low Daily columnist Yignesh
Venkataraman touched on a few
weeks ago. In 2010, avid fans and cu
rious Americans alike tuned in as
Landon Donovan pulled the United
States from the grip of early elimi
nation with his dramatic stoppage
time goal to send the United States
through to the knockout stages. The
past few years have only served to
heighten interest since the 2010
performance with the rising popu-

larity of the MLS, a 12-game
national team winning
streak, Klinsmann's arrival
and even recently the com
mitment of 18-year-old Bay
ern Munich product Julian
Green to the American col
ors.

Soccer has long lost out on
drawing some of the best
American athletes to the
sport, routinely being beat
out by football or basketball.
But with a strong perform
ance on soccer's biggest
stage at the high point of
American interest, the men's
national team could poten
tially change that. Mega
events like the World Cup or
the Olympics or the Super
Bowl in America often have
profound impacts on young
people's sports interests.
More eyes than ever will like
ly be watching this time
around, giving the national
team a powerful opportunity
to bring soccer nearer to the
top of American sports.
Despite all of this positive
momentum, hopes for the
2014 World Cup took a tum
ble after the World Cup draw.
With only two possible spots
remaining for the United
States, it was looking at ei
ther a relatively easy group
of Belgium, Algeria and Rus
sia, or a death group of pow
erhouse Germany, Cristiano
Ronaldo's Portugal and
nemesis Ghana. You know the
rest.
So now that the World
Cup is only 30 days away and
the national team is only
three days away from arriv
ing on campus to train, it's
time to think about what
needs to happen for success
and what we can expect in a
month.
The dooming factor from

the last World Cup came in
the United States' shaky
starts and, specifically, the
back line's proclivity to make
a crucial error. In three of the
four games, the other team
struck first within the first 15
minutes of the game. Prepa
ration and confidence will be
the key to avoid falling be
hind early, but the defense
must be able to maintain
tenacity and confidence
throughout the game to give
the United States a chance in
an offensively-gifted group.
Additionally, maintaining
spells of possession will be a
must for a side that lacks a
superstar able to blow by de
fenders or create opportuni
ties completely on his own
but also lacks an established
backline that has proven it
can withstand a siege to play
off the counter. This will fall
largely upon the shoulders of
Michael Bradley and whoev
er else accompanies him in
central midfield.
In spite of the group and
some of its deficiencies from
the last World Cup, the Unit
ed States has a tendency, sim
ply put, to just get it done. Set
pieces and a deep, experi
enced midfield are the great
est strengths for a team that
has thrived in an underdog
role in the past. At the Con
federations Cup in 2009, the
United States beat Spain 2-0
just a year before the
Spaniards would win the
World Cup and would later
lead Brazil 2-0 at halftime.
When the doubts are the
loudest, the United States
plays its best.
If the United States can
survive the first 15 minutes
and not allow easily avoid
able goals, it has a real
chance at advancing. Al
though Ghana may have
knocked the United States
out at the past two World
Cups, the United States will
be favored to win. Against
Portugal, if the United

States can prevent Ronaldo
from annihilating its de
fense, it may realize that Por
tugal isn't all that much bet
ter â€” while Portugal might
be more talented, it doesn't
play like it. Then facing Ger
many, the U.S. will certainly
be motivated by Klinsmann
and could be playing another
'B' squad if Germany has al
ready secured a berth in the
knockout stage, a likely sce
nario.
Yes, that's quite a few ifs.
But the ramifications on
what could happen as a re
sult are huge. A berth in the
knockout stage would proba
bly bring a record number of
American viewers for a soc
cer game. One more victory
and the U.S. could face Ar
gentina on July 4. And what
would be more patriotic than
rocking the red, white and
blue while cheering the na
tional team on against the
world's best player on Inde
pendence Day? The potential
for soccer to rise in America
from this World Cup is astro
nomical.
Twenty years ago, just
mentioning the prospect of
the United States making it
to the quarterfinals of the
World Cup was laughable
and irrelevant. The fact that
soccer has made it this far
and yet still has so much po
tential to grow is exciting, to
say the least. In the world's
most popular sport, America
is rising. Twenty years from
now, who knows what's in
store?

When the U.S. National
Team arrives on campus to
train in a few days, Michael
Peterson hopes that the play
ers will read this column and
petition Klinsmann to make
him head of soccer propagan
da. Support Michael's cause
