## Potential for this year's World Cup is incredible 
### Michael Peterson 
Twenty years can certainly
change a lot in sports. Flash
back 20 years from today
and the United States
men's soccer team had
never qualified for more than two
World Cups in a row. In fact, prior to
1994, the United States only made
four of the 14 World Cups.
After losing in the group stage in
1950, the United States failed to reach
the World Cup again until 1990, when
three losses including a humiliat
ing 5-1 defeat to Czechoslovakia
quickly saw it out the door.
However, when the United States
hosted the men's World Cup in 1994,
everything changed. The national
team beat Colombia for the first
time in history and battled Brazil,
the eventual champion, admirably
for 90 minutes. Soccer, previously
lacking real popularity in the scene
of American sports, gained a whole
new generation of fans in the United
States. Over 68,000 fans on average
showed up to every game, still a
World Cup record by over 16,000.
Fast-forward to today and soc
cer's popularity in America, and the
skill level of the United States men's
national team is arguably at the
highest it has ever been. Major
League Soccer is the fastest rising
sport in popularity in America. Sim
ilarly, the men's national team has
qualified for seven straight World
Cups, including three appearances
in the knockout stages. In 2013, the
United States men's national team
recorded 16 wins, including victo
ries over Germany (albeit the "B"
squad), Bosnia-Herzegovina and
Mexico, to finish the best calendar
year in its history in terms of both
wins and winning percentage. For
mer world-class player and new
coach Jurgen Klinsmann has
brought winning expectations and
mentality to a historically mediocre
soccer nation.
This World Cup just might be the
most important one in history for
soccer in the United States, as fel
low Daily columnist Yignesh
Venkataraman touched on a few
weeks ago. In 2010, avid fans and cu
rious Americans alike tuned in as
Landon Donovan pulled the United
States from the grip of early elimi
nation with his dramatic stoppage
time goal to send the United States
through to the knockout stages. The
past few years have only served to
heighten interest since the 2010
performance with the rising popu-
