Historians read documents that were written in the past,
and interpret them in order to come to grips with what
happened, why it happened, and why what happened is
important. But some historians, particularly those who
work in a very early and poorly documented historical
period like early medieval Britain, rely on material evidence
to reconstruct the past. One very promising class of
evidence is the evidence of human bones—bones excavated
by archaeologists. By studying bones, we can begin to
reconstruct the life histories, diets, and movements of
people in the past whose lives and deaths were never
captured by texts.
Lecture by Robin Fleming, Professor of History, Boston
College. Robin is a recipient of the 2013 Mac Arthur
Fellowship "Genius" award. The award praises her for
"changing the way historians view early medieval Britain
and providing a framework for incorporating material
culture into the writing of history."
