# Playoff hopes squashed
## Card miss out on postseason 
### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Softball's streak of
16 consecutive tournament ap
pearances is over as a difficult
season filled with injuries in the
pitching rotation has come to a
disappointing end. After starting
the regular season 13-0, the Car
dinal struggled through an im
mensely challenging conference
slate filled with talented squads.
However, the Card still had their
opportunities to pick up victories
against the Pac-12 elites. Stan
ford lost a pair of close contests
at Arizona and Arizona State
while also falling by 5-2 in the se
ries finale at UCLA.
Nevertheless, after last
week's huge win over No. 2
UCLA in the series opener, Stan
ford softball (30-25, 5-19 Pac-12)
still appeared to be poised to
squeak into the postseason with a

strong performance against a
struggling Oregon State (18-
31, 5-17 Pac-12) squad. For
the first game of this week
end's series, it appeared that
the Cardinal would follow
through on that task, routing
the Beavers 8-2 in the first
game of the three game set.
From there, the Card simply
collapsed, as Oregon State
roared past the Cardinal to
win the final two games of the
three-game set.
Poor pitching was Stan
ford's undoing this weekend
at Smith Family Stadium, as
the Cardinal rotation posted
a 7.00 ERA. In one rather ig
nominious stretch on Satur
day, the Card allowed eight
runs on four hits while com
mitting two errors, without
even recording a single out.
This stunning loss of form in
the circle turned a 9-5 Cardi
nal lead into a 13-9 deficit.
Stanford would not recover
from this breakdown, and the
Beavers took the game and
the series with the 13-9 win.
The Card's struggles in
the circle, which are directly
related to the loss of fresh
man Carley Hoover and jun
ior Nyree White early on in
the season, are all the more
disappointing considering
the strong offensive lineup
that the Cardinal has fielded
all year. Stanford will finish
the 2014 season with a .316
batting average, good for sec
ond in program history be
hind the 2012 team's .318
mark; in addition, the 2014
Cardinal set a record for the
most RBIs in a single season
with 302, breaking the previ
ous high mark of 298 RBIs
from Stanford's 2012 cam
paign.
True to form all season,
the Stanford offense had a
strong series against Oregon
State, posting a .308 team
batting average while aver
aging seven runs per game.
The Card's offensive per

formance was very balanced
this weekend, with seven
players hitting at least .300
against the Beavers.
Junior Leah White led
Stanford in slugging percent
age and total bases against

the Beavers, as the Phoenix,
Arizona native was able to un
leash the long ball for the sec
ond time in her 2014 cam
paign. White's blast on Satur
day in the bottom of the
fourth to deep left center field

helped cut the Beavers lead
to 5-4, while also jumpstart
ing a massive 7-run outburst.
Sophomore Kayla Bon
strom turned in a standout
performance for the Cardi
nal, with a .333 batting aver

age and two extra-base hits.
The Tucson, Arizona product
also notched three walks to
tie for the team lead in on
base percentage at .500 with
junior Tylyn Wells. Bon
strom's best showing came on
Friday in the Card's 12-4 loss
to the Beavers, as the 2013
Pac-12 Freshman of the Year
went 2-for-2 with an RBI dou
ble.
Finally, junior Cassandra
Roulund closed the 2014 reg
ular season with a strong
showing against Oregon
State, with all three of her
hits going for extra bases in
the series. On Friday,
Roulund notched her team
leading fourth triple of the
season for seventh all-time at
Stanford in a single season.
The 2013 Pac-12 Honorable
Mention selection is now
third all-time for triples in a
career, passing Cardinal
greats Kira Ching and Jenna
Rich with her 11th triple dur
ing her time on the Farm.
"I am really proud of our
team for fighting through the
adversity. We never give up,
and that is something that is
really special about this
year's team," said Roulund at
the Senior Day dinner after
Saturday's loss. "You look at
us at the beginning of the sea
son: our pitching was defi
nitely stronger, but with in
juries it has gone down. We
had it all, and it is just crazy to

such a different way from
how it started."
"I am very impressed

year," said head coach John
Rittman in reflecting on the
season. "They never gave up

associated with a team that

injuries and continues to fight
... that is impressive."
Stanford's 2015 season
will begin in February, as the
Card will begin a new quest
toward returning to the post
season.

strong performance against a
struggling Oregon State (18-
31, 5-17 Pac-12) squad. For
the first game of this week
end's series, it appeared that
the Cardinal would follow
through on that task, routing
the Beavers 8-2 in the first
game of the three game set.
From there, the Card simply
collapsed, as Oregon State
roared past the Cardinal to
win the final two games of the
three-game set.
Poor pitching was Stan
ford's undoing this weekend
at Smith Family Stadium, as
the Cardinal rotation posted
a 7.00 ERA. In one rather ig
nominious stretch on Satur
day, the Card allowed eight
runs on four hits while com
mitting two errors, without
even recording a single out.
This stunning loss of form in
the circle turned a 9-5 Cardi
nal lead into a 13-9 deficit.
Stanford would not recover
from this breakdown, and the
Beavers took the game and
the series with the 13-9 win.
The Card's struggles in
the circle, which are directly
related to the loss of fresh
man Carley Hoover and jun
ior Nyree White early on in
the season, are all the more
disappointing considering
the strong offensive lineup
that the Cardinal has fielded
all year. Stanford will finish
the 2014 season with a .316
batting average, good for sec
ond in program history be
hind the 2012 team's .318
mark; in addition, the 2014
Cardinal set a record for the
most RBIs in a single season
with 302, breaking the previ
ous high mark of 298 RBIs
from Stanford's 2012 cam
paign.
True to form all season,
the Stanford offense had a
strong series against Oregon
State, posting a .308 team
batting average while aver
aging seven runs per game.
The Card's offensive per

formance was very balanced
this weekend, with seven
players hitting at least .300
against the Beavers.
Junior Leah White led
Stanford in slugging percent
age and total bases against

the Beavers, as the Phoenix,
Arizona native was able to un
leash the long ball for the sec
ond time in her 2014 cam
paign. White's blast on Satur
day in the bottom of the
fourth to deep left center field

helped cut the Beavers lead
to 5-4, while also jumpstart
ing a massive 7-run outburst.
Sophomore Kayla Bon
strom turned in a standout
performance for the Cardi
nal, with a .333 batting aver

age and two extra-base hits.
The Tucson, Arizona product
also notched three walks to
tie for the team lead in on
base percentage at .500 with
junior Tylyn Wells. Bon
strom's best showing came on
Friday in the Card's 12-4 loss
to the Beavers, as the 2013
Pac-12 Freshman of the Year
went 2-for-2 with an RBI dou
ble.
Finally, junior Cassandra
Roulund closed the 2014 reg
ular season with a strong
showing against Oregon
State, with all three of her
hits going for extra bases in
the series. On Friday,
Roulund notched her team
leading fourth triple of the
season for seventh all-time at
Stanford in a single season.
The 2013 Pac-12 Honorable
Mention selection is now
third all-time for triples in a
career, passing Cardinal
greats Kira Ching and Jenna
Rich with her 11th triple dur
ing her time on the Farm.
"I am really proud of our
team for fighting through the
adversity. We never give up,
and that is something that is
really special about this
year's team," said Roulund at
the Senior Day dinner after
Saturday's loss. "You look at
us at the beginning of the sea
son: our pitching was defi
nitely stronger, but with in
juries it has gone down. We
had it all, and it is just crazy to
see how the season ended in
such a different way from
how it started."
"I am very impressed
with this team's grit and de
termination throughout the
year," said head coach John
Rittman in reflecting on the
season. "They never gave up
and they kept fighting. To be
associated with a team that
has had some adversity with
injuries and continues to fight
... that is impressive."
Stanford's 2015 season
will begin in February, as the
Card will begin a new quest
toward returning to the post
season.
