## OUTSIDE THE BUBBLE Long live the King 
### James Bradbury 
Last Wednesday, Thai Prime
Minister Yingluck Shinawa
tra younger sister of exiled
billionaire politician Thaksin Shi
nawatra and the current leader of
the political party he founded
was removed from office by Thai
land's Constitutional Court. This
week, now-ex-PM Yingluck the
least corrupt prime minister in mod
ern Thai history faces a five-year
ban from politics at the hands of the
country's National Anti-Corruption
Commission.
These moves together, the
fourth such ousting an elected prime
minister hailing from Thaksin's
party since 2006 are only the lat
est in a decade-long struggle that
pits Thailand's aristocratic estab
lishment against a tycoon they view
as a traitor, its urban middle class
against newly empowered rural
masses and King Rama IX's privy
council against the very man set to
succeed to the throne.
Thaksin's 2001 election victory
the first of five in a row by parties
he controls represented a dra
matic break from 20th century Thai
land's parade of corrupt coalition
governments interspersed with fre
quent military coups. Here was a
man with establishment credentials
he made his fortune through mo
nopoly contracts granted by con
tacts in the Thai military who
spurned established methods and
established power centers, instead
deciding to create his own con
stituency through populist policies.
But to his opponents Thaksin
would still be simply the latest and
most capable in a succession of cor
rupt party leaders that made mil
lions off the business of governing
while convincing the less-educated
sectors of the general public that he
represented their interests, were it
not for a deeper royal struggle with
which the fight against the Shinawa
tra family has become inextricably
intertwined.
Thaksin has thrown his lot in
with Crown Prince Maha Vajira
longkorn, a playboy with mistresses
in every corner of the world and a
longtime outcast in palace politics.
The American ambassador even de
scribed Thaksin in 2005 as having
"invested in crown prince futures."
The prospect of the prince becoming
Rama X as the present king wish
es and succession rules dictate is
a threat to the existing royal estab
lishment (which is linked closely
with the political, business, and mili
tary establishments in a web called
the "network monarchy"). It is sur
passed only by the prospect of Maha
Vajiralongkorn as king overseeing
another decade of Thaksin rule, this
time unfettered by the machinations
of the political elite, like the recent
moves against Yingluck.
King Bhumibol (Rama IX), the
longest-serving head of state in the
world and one of the longest-reign
ing monarchs in world history, will
likely pass away soon. With each
passing year, the importance to the
"royalist" forces (ironically, it is the
self-designated royalists who are
most opposed to the king's stated
wishes for succession) of holding
Parliament, by any means neces
sary, in order to amend the royal
succession law only grows.
The first such attempt a 2006
military coup against then-PM
Thaksin orchestrated by Privy
Council President General Prem
Tinsulanonda (himself seven years
older than the king) failed in its
primary objective of restoring Thai
land to the pre-Thaksin "tutelary
democracy" status quo. Instead it
gave rise to a pro-Thaksin popular
movement, the United Front for
Democracy against Dictatorship
(also known as the Red Shirts),
which joined the anti-Thaksin, "Yel
low Shirt" People's Alliance for
Democracy, already protesting on
the streets of Bangkok.
On the night of the coup, Thaksin
was at the UN General Assembly
meeting in New York. While he has
not returned to Thailand since to
face the corruption charges the coup
leaders brought against him, he has
repeatedly addressed Red Shirt ral
lies from exile in Dubai. When the
coup leaders called a new election, a
pro-Thaksin party won again. With
in months, the Yellow Shirts
stormed the capital, blocking the
doors to Parliament and seizing Su
varnabhumi International Airport.
Two politically motivated Consti
tutional Court rulings deposed two
pro-Thaksin prime ministers in late
2008, and the resulting unelected
government, led by PM Abhisit Vej
jajiva of the Democrat Party, be
came the target of several new
rounds of Red Shirt demonstrations.
At the height of the protests in 2010,
a government crackdown led to 91
deaths; Thaksin supporters alleged
that the Thai military fired on pro
testers.

The most recent protest move
ment began when PM Yingluck at
tempted to pass an amnesty bill that
would have allowed Thaksin to re
turn to Thailand (while also exoner
ating Abhisit of murder charges
surrounding the 2010 crackdown).
This movement, which calls itself
the People's Democratic Reform
Committee, is led by a charismatic,
belligerent, and nationalist former
Abhisit deputy named Suthep
Thaugsuban. Working with this
new group, the royalists have given
up any hope of defeating Thaksin at
the ballot box, instead openly call
ing for a temporary end to parlia
mentary democracy and the impo
sition of a royally-appointed oli
garchy to "reform" Thai politics
and rid the country of all traces of
the Shinawatra family.

Discussion of the royal aspects of
the present political fight is still
tightly limited by Thailand's lese
majeste law, which forbids criticism
of the king, the queen, and the crown
prince on pain of a 15-year prison
term thus making even well-es
tablished facts about the Royal Fam
ily (like the fact that the king proba
bly killed his predecessor by acci
dent in 1946, or that the king and
queen have been estranged since the
mid-1980s) sound like conspiracy
theories to those who have heard
only the official, public line.
Even foreign journalists are be
holden to the dictates of lese-ma
jeste. While BBC reporter Jonathan
Head managed to escape a threat
ened prosecution under the lese-ma
jeste law in 2008 in part because
his reporting had generally hewed
closely to the royalist line
Reuters editor Andrew MacGregor
Marshall had to resign from the com
pany in 2011 in order to publish an
expose on the Thai monarchy based
on recently leaked U.S. diplomatic
cables.
But like the anti-democratic na
ture of the royalist program, the suc
cession fight is increasingly out in
the open: PM Yingluck's cabinet
meetings in the months prior to her
dismissal featured a prominent por
trait of the Crown Prince, while
Princess Chulabhorn seen as a
supporter of alternative succession
options involving her sister Princess
Sirindhorn frequently displays
symbols of the anti-Thaksin protest
movement on her Instagram page.
This weekend, PDRC leader
Suthep argued that the removal of
PM Yingluck leaves a power vacuum
that can only be filled by an appoint
ment by the president of the Senate,
as the lower house was dissolved by
Yingluck prior to a February elec
tion that was boycotted by the oppo
sition and annulled by the Constitu
tional Court. But the Senate is also
without a president, and the Consti
tution states that only the prime
minister can submit the name of a
new Senate president for royal en
dorsement.
In short, just about anything
could happen now. The latest news is
that Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn,
who recently solidified control over
additional military posts, has warned
the officers under his authority
against any attempt at a coup.
The larger struggle of which
the political fight, the palace disputes
and the protests and street violence
are only the most visible parts will
no doubt continue as it has continued
since the 1932 revolution against the
Thai absolute monarchy. The Thai
establishment has proven that it will
stop at nothing to resist the rise of
true democracy in Thailand. But
with Thaksin, Yingluck and their le
gions of supporters and for the
first time since Pridi Banomyong,
the leader of the 1932 revolution, was
framed by an official investigation
for the murder of Rama VIII Thai
democracy at least has a name, a face

At the height of

government
crackdown led to
91 deaths.

Last Wednesday, Thai Prime
Minister Yingluck Shinawa
tra younger sister of exiled
billionaire politician Thaksin Shi
nawatra and the current leader of
the political party he founded
was removed from office by Thai
land's Constitutional Court. This
week, now-ex-PM Yingluck the
least corrupt prime minister in mod
ern Thai history faces a five-year
ban from politics at the hands of the
country's National Anti-Corruption
Commission.
These moves together, the
fourth such ousting an elected prime
minister hailing from Thaksin's
party since 2006 are only the lat
est in a decade-long struggle that
pits Thailand's aristocratic estab
lishment against a tycoon they view
as a traitor, its urban middle class
against newly empowered rural
masses and King Rama IX's privy
council against the very man set to
succeed to the throne.
Thaksin's 2001 election victory
the first of five in a row by parties
he controls represented a dra
matic break from 20th century Thai
land's parade of corrupt coalition
governments interspersed with fre
quent military coups. Here was a
man with establishment credentials
he made his fortune through mo
nopoly contracts granted by con
tacts in the Thai military who
spurned established methods and
established power centers, instead
deciding to create his own con
stituency through populist policies.
But to his opponents Thaksin
would still be simply the latest and
most capable in a succession of cor
rupt party leaders that made mil
lions off the business of governing
while convincing the less-educated
sectors of the general public that he
represented their interests, were it
not for a deeper royal struggle with
which the fight against the Shinawa
tra family has become inextricably
intertwined.
Thaksin has thrown his lot in
with Crown Prince Maha Vajira
longkorn, a playboy with mistresses
in every corner of the world and a
longtime outcast in palace politics.
The American ambassador even de
scribed Thaksin in 2005 as having
"invested in crown prince futures."
The prospect of the prince becoming
Rama X as the present king wish
es and succession rules dictate is
a threat to the existing royal estab
lishment (which is linked closely
with the political, business, and mili
tary establishments in a web called
the "network monarchy"). It is sur
passed only by the prospect of Maha
Vajiralongkorn as king overseeing
another decade of Thaksin rule, this
time unfettered by the machinations
of the political elite, like the recent
moves against Yingluck.
King Bhumibol (Rama IX), the
longest-serving head of state in the
world and one of the longest-reign
ing monarchs in world history, will
likely pass away soon. With each
passing year, the importance to the
"royalist" forces (ironically, it is the
self-designated royalists who are
most opposed to the king's stated
wishes for succession) of holding
Parliament, by any means neces
sary, in order to amend the royal
succession law only grows.
The first such attempt a 2006
military coup against then-PM
Thaksin orchestrated by Privy
Council President General Prem
Tinsulanonda (himself seven years
older than the king) failed in its
primary objective of restoring Thai
land to the pre-Thaksin "tutelary
democracy" status quo. Instead it
gave rise to a pro-Thaksin popular
movement, the United Front for
Democracy against Dictatorship
(also known as the Red Shirts),
which joined the anti-Thaksin, "Yel
low Shirt" People's Alliance for
Democracy, already protesting on
the streets of Bangkok.
On the night of the coup, Thaksin
was at the UN General Assembly
meeting in New York. While he has
not returned to Thailand since to
face the corruption charges the coup
leaders brought against him, he has
repeatedly addressed Red Shirt ral
lies from exile in Dubai. When the
coup leaders called a new election, a
pro-Thaksin party won again. With
in months, the Yellow Shirts
stormed the capital, blocking the
doors to Parliament and seizing Su
varnabhumi International Airport.
Two politically motivated Consti
tutional Court rulings deposed two
pro-Thaksin prime ministers in late
2008, and the resulting unelected
government, led by PM Abhisit Vej
jajiva of the Democrat Party, be
came the target of several new
rounds of Red Shirt demonstrations.
At the height of the protests in 2010,
a government crackdown led to 91
deaths; Thaksin supporters alleged
that the Thai military fired on pro
testers.

The most recent protest move
ment began when PM Yingluck at
tempted to pass an amnesty bill that
would have allowed Thaksin to re
turn to Thailand (while also exoner
ating Abhisit of murder charges
surrounding the 2010 crackdown).
This movement, which calls itself
the People's Democratic Reform
Committee, is led by a charismatic,
belligerent, and nationalist former
Abhisit deputy named Suthep
Thaugsuban. Working with this
new group, the royalists have given
up any hope of defeating Thaksin at
the ballot box, instead openly call
ing for a temporary end to parlia
mentary democracy and the impo
sition of a royally-appointed oli
garchy to "reform" Thai politics
and rid the country of all traces of
the Shinawatra family.

Discussion of the royal aspects of
the present political fight is still
tightly limited by Thailand's lese
majeste law, which forbids criticism
of the king, the queen, and the crown
prince on pain of a 15-year prison
term thus making even well-es
tablished facts about the Royal Fam
ily (like the fact that the king proba
bly killed his predecessor by acci
dent in 1946, or that the king and
queen have been estranged since the
mid-1980s) sound like conspiracy
theories to those who have heard
only the official, public line.
Even foreign journalists are be
holden to the dictates of lese-ma
jeste. While BBC reporter Jonathan
Head managed to escape a threat
ened prosecution under the lese-ma
jeste law in 2008 in part because
his reporting had generally hewed
closely to the royalist line
Reuters editor Andrew MacGregor
Marshall had to resign from the com
pany in 2011 in order to publish an
expose on the Thai monarchy based
on recently leaked U.S. diplomatic
cables.
But like the anti-democratic na

testers.

The most recent protest move
ment began when PM Yingluck at
tempted to pass an amnesty bill that
would have allowed Thaksin to re
turn to Thailand (while also exoner
ating Abhisit of murder charges
surrounding the 2010 crackdown).
This movement, which calls itself
the People's Democratic Reform
Committee, is led by a charismatic,
belligerent, and nationalist former
Abhisit deputy named Suthep
Thaugsuban. Working with this
new group, the royalists have given
up any hope of defeating Thaksin at
the ballot box, instead openly call
ing for a temporary end to parlia
mentary democracy and the impo
sition of a royally-appointed oli
garchy to "reform" Thai politics
and rid the country of all traces of
the Shinawatra family.

Discussion of the royal aspects of
the present political fight is still
tightly limited by Thailand's lese
majeste law, which forbids criticism
of the king, the queen, and the crown
prince on pain of a 15-year prison
term thus making even well-es
tablished facts about the Royal Fam
ily (like the fact that the king proba
bly killed his predecessor by acci
dent in 1946, or that the king and
queen have been estranged since the
mid-1980s) sound like conspiracy
theories to those who have heard
only the official, public line.
Even foreign journalists are be
holden to the dictates of lese-ma
jeste. While BBC reporter Jonathan
Head managed to escape a threat
ened prosecution under the lese-ma
jeste law in 2008 in part because
his reporting had generally hewed
closely to the royalist line
Reuters editor Andrew MacGregor
Marshall had to resign from the com
pany in 2011 in order to publish an
expose on the Thai monarchy based
on recently leaked U.S. diplomatic
cables.
But like the anti-democratic na
ture of the royalist program, the suc
cession fight is increasingly out in
the open: PM Yingluck's cabinet
meetings in the months prior to her
dismissal featured a prominent por
trait of the Crown Prince, while
Princess Chulabhorn seen as a
supporter of alternative succession
options involving her sister Princess
Sirindhorn frequently displays
symbols of the anti-Thaksin protest
movement on her Instagram page.
This weekend, PDRC leader
Suthep argued that the removal of
PM Yingluck leaves a power vacuum
that can only be filled by an appoint
ment by the president of the Senate,
as the lower house was dissolved by
Yingluck prior to a February elec
tion that was boycotted by the oppo
sition and annulled by the Constitu
tional Court. But the Senate is also
without a president, and the Consti
tution states that only the prime
minister can submit the name of a
new Senate president for royal en
dorsement.
In short, just about anything
could happen now. The latest news is
that Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn,
who recently solidified control over
additional military posts, has warned
the officers under his authority
against any attempt at a coup.
The larger struggle of which
the political fight, the palace disputes
and the protests and street violence
are only the most visible parts will
no doubt continue as it has continued
since the 1932 revolution against the
Thai absolute monarchy. The Thai
establishment has proven that it will
stop at nothing to resist the rise of
true democracy in Thailand. But
with Thaksin, Yingluck and their le
gions of supporters and for the
first time since Pridi Banomyong,
the leader of the 1932 revolution, was
framed by an official investigation
for the murder of Rama VIII Thai
democracy at least has a name, a face
and a chance.
