## A
						Republican love affair 
### Nick Ahamed 
This is the story of a Republican
love affair: a love affair with
Benghazi and a love affair with
buzzwords.
Last Monday, Rasmussen Re
ports released a new poll saying that
72 percent of Americans want "the
truth" about what happened in
Benghazi (what else they would
want remains unclear). Around the
same time, a newly released email
discussed the Obama administra
tion's response to the attack.
Republicans have co-opted these
two developments, calling for a new
set of congressional hearings on the
matter.
So what exactly happened in
Benghazi? A study by the New York
Times brings us to Benghazi,
Libya's second largest city, in mid-
September of 2012. A Californian
had released a film titled "The Inno
cence of Muslims" and Cairo, Egypt
was bustling with protest. On the
night of September 11, that violence
spread to Libya.
Ambassador Chris Stevens was
visiting the American compound in
Benghazi. When assailants entered,

the small American security team
escaped to a CIA annex, where two
were killed. Mr. Stevens and one
other died in the fire started during
the initial attack on the compound.
While it is clear that the attack was
not the result of spontaneous
protest, it is also clear that Al-Qaeda
was not involved.
With these details relatively
clearly delineated by the Times, you
maybe asking what Republicans are
still wondering about.
Well, it has much less to do with
the tragic deaths of four American
diplomats than it does with Presi
dent Obama's response.
The day after the attack, Presi
dent Obama called the event an act
of terror. However, National Securi
ty Advisor Susan Rice went on Meet
the Press and suggested, not incor
rectly and based on the CIAs intelli
gence report, that given the most
current information available at the
time, it seemed like the attack was a
protest gone wrong.
Admittedly the Administration
did not come out with a strong, uni
fied statement of what happened for

two weeks. For this, Republicans
have sentenced President Obama to
criticism eternal.
Imagine the Republican counter
factual:
The President, in anger over
terrorism resulting in Ameri
cans deaths, decried the need for
retaliation. With limited intelli
gence to suggest terrorist in
volvement, the President de
ployed troops in search of the
perpetrators. However, in a war
torn country without the peo
ple's unanimous support, this
seemed an impossible task. More
and more troops were needed
'while the mission crept, out of
control. After nine years, $1 tril
lion and 1,500 casualties, we
leave.
That was the Iraq War; we need
not repeat it.
Regardless of how a Republican
would have responded, perhaps con
gressional Republicans are justified
in asking if the administration acted
responsibly.
