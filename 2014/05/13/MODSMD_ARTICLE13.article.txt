## A 						Republican love affair 
### Nick Ahamed 
This is the story of a Republican
love affair: a love affair with
Benghazi and a love affair with
buzzwords.
Last Monday, Rasmussen Re
ports released a new poll saying that
72 percent of Americans want "the
truth" about what happened in
Benghazi (what else they would
want remains unclear). Around the
same time, a newly released email
discussed the Obama administra
tion's response to the attack.
Republicans have co-opted these
two developments, calling for a new
set of congressional hearings on the
matter.
So what exactly happened in
Benghazi? A study by the New York
Times brings us to Benghazi,
Libya's second largest city, in mid-
September of 2012. A Californian
had released a film titled "The Inno
cence of Muslims" and Cairo, Egypt
was bustling with protest. On the
night of September 11, that violence
spread to Libya.
Ambassador Chris Stevens was
visiting the American compound in
Benghazi. When assailants entered,

the small American security team
escaped to a CIA annex, where two
were killed. Mr. Stevens and one
other died in the fire started during
the initial attack on the compound.
While it is clear that the attack was
not the result of spontaneous
protest, it is also clear that Al-Qaeda
was not involved.
With these details relatively
clearly delineated by the Times, you
maybe asking what Republicans are
still wondering about.
Well, it has much less to do with
the tragic deaths of four American
diplomats than it does with Presi
dent Obama's response.
The day after the attack, Presi
dent Obama called the event an act
of terror. However, National Securi
ty Advisor Susan Rice went on Meet
the Press and suggested, not incor
rectly and based on the CIAs intelli
gence report, that given the most
current information available at the
time, it seemed like the attack was a
protest gone wrong.
Admittedly the Administration
did not come out with a strong, uni
fied statement of what happened for

two weeks. For this, Republicans
have sentenced President Obama to
criticism eternal.
Imagine the Republican counter
factual:
The President, in anger over
terrorism resulting in Ameri
cans deaths, decried the need for
retaliation. With limited intelli
gence to suggest terrorist in
volvement, the President de
ployed troops in search of the
perpetrators. However, in a war
torn country without the peo
ple's unanimous support, this
seemed an impossible task. More
and more troops were needed
'while the mission crept, out of
control. After nine years, $1 tril
lion and 1,500 casualties, we
leave.
That was the Iraq War; we need
not repeat it.
Regardless of how a Republican
would have responded, perhaps con
gressional Republicans are justified
in asking if the administration acted
responsibly.
Think back to 2012:
Susan Rice leaked to the
New York Times that it
was not a terrorist attack.
She then went on Sunday
morning talk shows and
cited that very Times ar
ticle to which she had con
tributed, supporting her
point that there ivas no
clear evidence of terror
ism. And when a reporter
went to Libya to investi
gate, concluding that the
attack was planned, the
administration leaked
the reporter's wife's CIA
undercover alias.
Sounds like it merits con
demnation, right? Except, it's

all complete fiction. Replace
Susan Rice with Dick Cheney
and a terrorist attack with
nuclear weapons and you
have a real event.
Where was the Republi
can outrage when the Bush
administration endangered
the life of Valerie Plame, the
aforementioned CIA opera
tive?
Of course presidential ad
ministrations are going to
spin their policy, and of course
Americans should no doubt
ask whether that policy rep
resents their interests.
But that does not give Re
publicans the right to make
hay or politics when
the sun doesn't shine.
According to analysis
from the Sunlight Founda
tion, "Benghazi" was refer
enced 66 times in September
2012 43 times by Republi

cans and 23 by Democrats. In
October, those numbers were
0 and 3 respectively.
But in September 2013,
Republicans referenced it
147 times (and Democrats 9).
This month nearly two
years after the event hap
pened it has garnered 111
mentions from Republicans.
In fact, this data demon
strates that Republicans
have referenced "Benghazi"
more than they have "jobs."
Benghazi has allowed Re
publicans to move on from
their last buzzword infatua
tion: "Obamacare." Once ref
erenced 2317 times in one
month, May has seen only 19
mentions so far.
I would encourage Repub
licans to look back at their past
buzzword relationships. Bash
ing Obamacare didn't win
them 2012. And despite men

tioning "impeachment" 536
times making it the
month's most popular buzz
word in October 1998, Re
publicans actually lost seats in
the 1998 midterm elections.
That was the first time since
1934 that the party of the pres
ident gained seats in the
House in a midterm election.
I suggest that Republi
cans drop their love affair and
get back to the issues to
which they are supposed to be
wedded. Nine million people
are unemployed. Democrats
have mentioned "unemploy
ment" 2093 times in 2014.
That number for Republicans
is only about one-third, or
795.
It's time to move on. Move
on to Americans in need.
