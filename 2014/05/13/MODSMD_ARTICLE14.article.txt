# Convergence
## There is a sense of apathy in Americans today. 
### Anthony Ghosn 
Despite the fact that none of
my parents were born in the
United States, I would de
scribe myself as being an American
patriot. I spent the last sixteen out
of the first eighteen years of my life
living in other countries and yet I
feel an incredible passion about the
issues facing this country.
When I try to pinpoint the origin
of that passion, I constantly trace it
to David McCullough's 1776. In his
narrative history of the beginning
of the rebellion that became the
Revolution, McCullough paints a
brilliant portrait of the men who
laid their lives down for the princi
ples of that revolution. It was when
I first tried to put myself in their
shoes that I first realized the enor
mity of their task and began to ap
preciate the exceptional nature of
this nation.
The rebels' faith that there was
something better for them in an in
dependent America was astound
ing. There is a story about a rebel
named Nathan Hale who was cap
tured in New York in September
1776 by the English and sentenced

to death. Before being hung, he is
said to have cried, "My only regret
is that I have but one life to give to
my country."
It's hard to imagine the kind of
blinding, all-powerful hope that
that story implies. It's genuinely
hard, in this age of relative apathy,
to understand that men were will
ing to lay down their lives for a new
country and a new idea of society:
That they were willing to stand up
to the mightiest army in the world
armed only with their faith in the
future of this land.
When I think about those men,
men who were my age, I cannot
help but feel a sense of frustration
at the current state of affairs. There
is a sense of apathy in Americans

today. Many friends tell me that
"constitutional violations are so ab
stract" and that the Constitution is
effectively irrelevant to our every
day lives. They repeat that histori
cally, the United States has been
nowhere near as socially egalitari
an or tolerant as it is now. They re
mind me constantly that the re
volving door in Washington is prac
tically incomparable to the corrup
tion that was prevalent during the
gilded age. They point out the fact
that in the sixties, it was surprising
that we had a white Catholic Presi
dent instead of a Protestant one
and now, five decades later, we have
an African-American president.
Essentially, they make
the case that there has been a
steady upward curve in
American history and so the
nation will inevitably sort it
self out. And they are right,
for the most part, in that
there is really no such thing
as the "good old days" for
America. We have seen enor
mous progress.
However, when you think
back to the men who laid
their lives down for this na
tion the men whose blind
hope and faith in the future of

this country led them into
battle against what was then
the most formidable empire
in human history you can
not help but feel that they
would be disappointed. That
perhaps we owe it to them, if
not to ourselves, to try to
bring about a convergence
between the reality of this
nation and the ideal it was
made to embody. And we
must approach this goal ac
tively we must not simply
wait and hope that it will be
achieved for us.
Yes, the enterprise of con
vergence can be exhausting
and seem futile, but it is part
and parcel of the American
story. It's a vision, a perspec
tive, that transcends time,

space, race, religion, social
class and gender. It connect
ed Obama during his brilliant
speech at the 2004 Democrat
ic Convention to the young
boys who slept in fields out
side of Boston in 1776. It is
why being a patriot does not
mean agreeing with every
thing the nation does or is,
but rather, finding the places
where we could improve and
do justice to the exceptional
story that we've inherited. It
means holding our elected of
ficials accountable and trying
to tell as many people as will
listen where we can continue
to improve.
