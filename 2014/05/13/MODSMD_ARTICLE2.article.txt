# STUDENT LIFE
## Killer game enlivens dorm community Students go to great lengths to win at Assassins, a Stanford dorm tradition 
### KYLIE JUE DESK EDITOR 
A tradition so embedded in Stanford cul
ture that its origins are unknown, the game of
Assassins brings a stronger sense of communi
ty, a fun distraction and temporary paranoia to
many dorms each year.
Game rules vary among the residences.
Players in the live-action game are each as
signed another player to "assassinate." De
pending on the rules, kills may involve shoot
ing the victim with a water or Nerf gun, throw
ing a sock at the target or poking the individual
with a spoon, usually without anyone witness
ing the kill.
Some dorms also make areas such as in
session classes, bathrooms, dining halls or
dorm rooms "safe zones" places where play
ers cannot be killed. Other variations of the
game describe who can witness a kill for it to re
main valid, whether or not targets can pursue
their assassins and how long assassins can take
to pursue their victims before timing out.
The organizers and the winners
Dorm staff, especially resident computer
consultants (RCCs) in freshman dorms, typi
cally organize the game. Gavilan Galloway 'l5,
an RCC in Serra and the dorm's "game mas
ter" for the last two weeks, created and hosted
an Assassins website on his Raspberry Pi, a
credit card-sized computer. The project began
in the fall with his desire to create a web-serv
er from scratch, and the site, which automati
cally assigns targets and allows players to re
port kills, has been used by Otero, Trancos and
Serra this year.
Galloway explained that he modeled his
version of the rules off his previous dorm As
sassins games and added small fixes to areas
that he found had been problematic. He also
spoke about his experiences as a freshman and
sophomore.
"It consumed everyone for the week that
we played, and everyone was talking about it,"
Galloway said. "It was actually a big stress for
a lot of people, but it was a good experience. I
got pretty into it. I took the final three even as
far as to break a couple friendships for a little
while."
"Game masters" can also be the residents
themselves. This year, Teddy Morris-Knower
'l7, a member of Larkin's dorm government,
coordinated his dorm's game of Assassins dur
ing winter quarter by getting feedback from
his peers and developing rules based on his
previous experience playing during camp.
"I talked to the staff members to figure out
how they played it last year," Morris-Knower
said, "and I talked to some other kids who had
played it either at their high schools or at other
events to try to figure out what would the best
way to do it in a dorm situation."
He said that over 80 percent of the dorm
played and that the game brought members of
the dorm together.
"People are definitely much more focused
on their dorm [when playing]," Morris-Know
er said. "It was definitely a different atmos
phere that I haven't seen since. It was really

cool."
Morris-Knower said that one stu
dent changed the HTML of one of
the target emails in order to trick an
other player. Larkin's winner was a
basketball player whose four days of
absence brought her automatically
into the final three.
Katelyn Phan 'l5, this year's win
ner in Okada, worked with her room
mate to stay alive together until the
final three. Despite her opponent
"stalking" Phan to her midterm, she

managed to catch him on a staircase.

The good, bad and ugly
Like Morris-Knower, Phan
spoke about the positive sense of
community and fun that the game
brought to the dorm.
However, not all of the effects of
Assassins are positive. Students in
general agreed that players can get
extremely involved in Assassins and
end up taldng the game very seriously
"People would have a lot of nega
tive feelings because people would
just get... really competitive [dur
ing Assassins]," Phan said. "In the
end, everyone's just like, 'Oh, it's just
a game,' but people do get paranoid."
Living in constant paranoia that a

friend could shoot you when your
guard is down often creates an addi
tional stress for students. Camille
Townshend 'l7 spoke about the
Freshman-Sophomore College's
(FroSoCo) game this year, which
ended abruptly after a weekend
break.
"It was stressful," Townshend
said. "I had a super-elaborate plan
for my person. I even know them. I
stalked them on Facebook. I actually
looked them up in my email and I fig
ured out that he was [an ASSU Sen
ator]."
Townshend explained that after
organizers gave the residents a
weekend off to do work, no one want
ed to resume playing.

Organizers implemented a break
over the weekend to give everyone a
chance to study but after the two
days, no one went back to playing.
Even one of the most successful
players did not want to restart after
the weekend since "Assassins was
consuming [his] life."
The negative effects were also
felt by the FroSoCo coordinator, who
was asked many questions about
gameplay and eventually driven to
pass the responsibility to a different
staff member.
Yet despite its negative aspects,
Townshend still agreed that Assas
sins still had redeeming values.
"It was fun while I was there,"
Townshend said. "I especially liked

helping other people stay in the
game."
Galloway, who explained that the
tradition is less of a big deal in upper
class dorms than it is for freshmen,
spoke about the effects of Assassins
from the perspective of a "game
master."
"It has a very disruptive effect,
and I say this in the kindest way,"
Galloway said. "It rustles everyone
necessarily for a good week and gets
everyone's juices flowing and gets
them out of their rut for a while. It's
like a good jolt in the system for a
brief amount of time."
