# Nobel laureates reflect on life experiences
## Douglas Osheroff and Thomas Südhof talk research, sustainability 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Professor Emeritus of
Physics Douglas Osheroff and
Professor in the School of
Medicine Thomas Siidhof
were invited to speak for the
third and final installment of
the Class of 2015's Junior
Speaker Series, "Intelligence
for Impact: A Nobel Laureate
Panel," in Cemex Auditorium
on Monday night.
Osheroff, winner of the
1996 Nobel Prize in Physics,
and Siidhof, winner of the
2013 Nobel Prize in Physiolo
gy or Medicine, were asked a
series of questions by Profes
sor of Computer Science
Mehran Sahami '92 M.S. '93
Ph.D. '99, who moderated the
event.
Main themes of the talk in
cluded the passion and deter
mination behind research, the
need for innate curiosity for
great discoveries and changes
and challenges in the world
that have yet to be fully ad
dressed.
Both professors agreed
that energy production and
the transition away from fossil
fuels are among the greatest
of challenges society faces
today. Siidhof recognized the
significance of reducing pollu
tion and finding alternative
energy resources.
"Life certainly is filled with
huge challenges, like trying to

understand diseases of the
brain," Sudhof said. "Howev
er, those challenges pale in im
portance, I believe, compared
to this overall change in the
world and our planet that
seem to be quite overwhelm
ing. It's a major technological
challenge that doesn't only re
volve around energy; it re
volves around societies."
Taking action to accom
plish major goals by first
clearly defining their motiva
tions is key to progress, Sud
hof said.
"The essence of science is
that you study something be
cause you want to find what
the truth about that some
thing is," Sudhof said. "As a
scientist you are trying to find
out what is the truth about a
certain subject... in order to
deliberate on what needs to be
done in the future, you need to
get the best assessment possi
ble of the actual facts."
Osheroff's definition of re
search complements Sudhof's
definition of science as a
process of intrigue. Osheroff
shared that his high school
chemistry teacher's metaphor
for research has stayed with
him to this day.
"He came to class one day
and he had milk cartons," Os
heroff said. "Research is like
trying to figure out what's in
side the milk cartons. Every
you're asking a question of
nature. Nature has to answer
your questions. Nature's an
swers aren't like what's in
side the milk carton, but
something about what's in
side the milk carton."

In response to what it
takes to become a successful
scientist or researcher, Siid
hof put curiosity before intel
lect.
"Intelligence is often
overrated," he said. "The
best predictor of success is
how innately curious the per
son is. That has been a better
predictor than anything else
I have seen for actually doing
something interesting."
Junior Class President
Jordan Shapiro 'l5 planned
for the event to focus more on
the life of the laureates than

on academia.
"The purpose of the panel
is not to convince our student
body to pursue academia or
to aspire for a Nobel Prize,"
Shapiro said. "Rather, we
want to focus on where these

leaders were during their un
dergraduate years and the
unpredictable path that lay
ahead of them before they re
ally achieved this excel
lence."
Rohit Talreja 'l5, a junior

class cabinet member and
one of the main organizers
for the event, noted a dis
crepancy between how much
Stanford speaks about its
Nobel laureates and how
much students get to actually

interact with them.
"I hope students will get
inspiration from this and use
their education for solving
real-world problems," Talre
ja said. "I hope the laureates
will give us inspiration for

tackling problems of our gen
eration by sharing their ex
periences with accomplish
ing things on a larger scale."
