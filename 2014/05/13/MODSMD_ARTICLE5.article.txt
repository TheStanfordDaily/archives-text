# NCAA BERTH BOOKED
## Fifth-place finish earns Card spot in championships 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
Since beginning its season on
Sept. 9 at the Dale McNamara
Fall Preview in Tulsa, Oklahoma,
the Stanford women's golf team
has come full circle. On Saturday,
the Cardinal punched another
ticket to Tulsa. This time, the trip
will have slightly more signifi
cance: the chance at a national
championship.
The Card ensured their spot
in the 24-team field at the NCAA
Championships with their fifth
place finish at the East Regional,
which ended Saturday in Talla
hassee, Florida. It marks the
fifth consecutive season in which
the program has advanced to the
championship round. Last year,
the team placed T-13th, a big step
forward considering Stanford
had recorded finishes of T-19th,
23rd and 24th in the three previ
ous seasons. As in its 2013 region
al event, Anne Walker's squad
did not play its absolute best, but
the effort was more than enough
to move on.
"Regionals is all about survive
and advance," Walker said. "It's
always a crazy week with a lot of
teams playing with nothing to
lose and a handful of teams play
ing with everything to lose. That
creates a lot of drama and Cin
derella stories. We are certainly
glad to have clinched a spot."
Advancing did not come easi
ly, though. In Thursday's open
ing round, the Cardinal played
like the team that had everything
to lose, finishing the day tied for

11th in the 24-squad event, out
side of the top-eight position
needed to qualify for NCAAs.
Despite a strong first 18 holes
from sophomore Mariah Stack
house, whose 4-under 68 put her

in a tie for third in the individual
standings, Stanford was in a
three-way tie for 11th at the end
of day one.
Though obviously not the aus
picious start the team was hoping

for, the field was bunched up,
with the eleven squads occupying
sixth through 15th separated by
just six strokes. Moreover, the
Card were only five shots out of
fifth and realized that their aver
age opening round did not doom
their chances. But they also knew
they would need to get more pro
duction from senior Marissa Mar
and junior Mariko Tumangan
who combined to shoot 13-over
on Thursday at the back end
of their lineup.
Both Mar and Tumangan low
ered their scores from day one in
Friday's second round, allowing
the Cardinal to vault up the team
leaderboard on golf's traditional
moving day. Mar, the only senior
Walker has used in her traveling
lineup, bettered her first-round
performance by five strokes,
going from 6-over 78 to 1-over 73.
This time, it was freshman Casey
Danielson's turn to lead the
young but experienced quintet;
the Wisconsin native carded a 2-
under 70 on the Southwood
course, birdieing the 13th, 15th
and 16th holes down the stretch.
Stackhouse chugged along
with another under-par round,
which gave her the outright lead
after 36 holes. Her classmate
Lauren Kim replicated her
Thursday score, turning in an
other even-par round another
example of the consistency that
has defined her career on the
Farm thus far. The unit's five
shot improvement from the day
before moved them into the safe
zone at sixth place.
Still, Stanford, a paltry four
strokes clear of eighth place when
competition started on Saturday
morning, could not just dial it in.
The team avoided a letdown,
turning in the sixth-best score of
the final round with a l-over 289

overall as the Cardinal advanced to the NCAA Championships.
to move up a spot into its final
position of fifth. Kim played
an impressive last 18 holes,
holing an eagle on the 498-
yard, par-510th hole to begin
her day en route to a 3-under
69. However, Stackhouse fal
tered, shooting 2-over 74 to
fall out of the lead and the in
dividual top 10, eventually
placing T-llth alongside
Kim. But the final round
tumble did not dampen the
sophomore's spirits and in
fact strengthened her team
centered attitude.

"I'm pleased with my per
formance individually," Stack
house remarked. "I didn't
have the finish I would have
liked, but it's the first time this
spring I've been in a good po
sition and posted some solid
numbers. Regionals is all
about the team, and I was just
focused on keeping that in
mind and playing for us."
Vanderbilt won the East
Regional handily, shooting a
combined 24-under to beat
second-place South Carolina
by 14 shots and Stanford by
26. Jenny Hahn's individual
victory gave the Com
modores a sweep of the
medal honors. Top-seeded
Duke finished tied for third
with North Carolina State.

Virginia, Tulane and Camp
bell followed the Cardinal.
Though Walker's squad did
not play up to its true poten
tial in Tallahassee, she is
proud of the grit and deter
mination it showed on what
turned out to be a very tough
golf course.
"We got better each day
on the course," said Walker of
her unit's performance on
the unfamiliar Bermuda
grass. "We were more com
fortable on the greens and in
the rough by the end of the
tournament and it showed.
We were the only team be
sides Pepperdine to compete
not from the East region, so
the climb was uphill but we
made it."

Stanford will enjoy about
10 days off before it heads to
Tulsa for the NCAA Champi
onships, which begin May 20.
The next week and a half will
not be filled with just relax
ation Walker knows there
is still work to be done if the
program is to accomplish its
most ambitious goal.
"We just have to keep
working on 100 yards and in,"
Walker said. "I saw a lot of
missed opportunities from
that range and in Tulsa if we
want to compete, we have to
make those. Tulsa [Country
Club] is hard. Ups-and
downs will be imperative."
