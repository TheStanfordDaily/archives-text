## Lakers should improve with D'Antonigone 
### Ashley Westnem 
As a Lakers fan, I'm sure
that the Lakers have
lost many bandwagon,
fair-weather fans this
season and so I've tried
to avoid writing about them because
most people don't really care.
Although I might sheepishly, and
sometimes begrudgingly, answer
"the Lakers" when people ask me
what my NBA team is and then
quickly reconsider whether I should
have said the Warriors I'm still a
Los Angeles girl through and through
and I'll stick by my team (even though
I can't remember watching an entire
game through this season).
But my excitement for the future
was renewed when I read in a tweet
that Mike D'Antoni had resigned.
I grew up in the Phil Jackson era of
the Lakers and went to the 2008 NBA
Finals at Staples against the Celtics
(the one that we won) and wore my
Lakers jersey far too many times to
school when I was younger. So when
Phil Jackson left, I felt like a part of the
Lakers in me had departed and that no
coach would fill it â€”and I was right.

The Mikes did not deliver and it's
just gone downhill since Jackson de
parted of the last four coaches, only
Jackson left the team of his own voli
tion and on his own terms. And then
without Kobe Bryant... well, that was
when I just stopped watching.
Then I read Magic Johnson's
tweet saying, "Happy days are here
again! Mike D'Antoni resigns as the
Lakers coach. I couldn't be happier!" I
think it was pretty evident to all that
this change was inevitable and would
be welcomed by all. Bryant wasn't
quite as enthusiastic and instead said
that he didn't care, probably indiffer
ent towards the disastrous season.
But now there's a chance for a
fresh start with a new coach and hope
fully a healthy Kobe. The latter says
he wants to have input in the hiring
process kind of a diva move, but it's
Kobe Bryant, so he's entitled. I will
definitely be interested this year for
the first time in a while to see what the
Lakers have in store for us. And hope
fully all the bandwagon jumpers will
have a little faith in the Lakers as well.
To be quite honest, after D'Antoni
led the Lakers to their worst season in
franchise history, it can't get any
worse for the team. Everything that
could have gone wrong for the Lakers
over the past two years did go wrong
under D'Antoni. Injuries, bad coach
ing style, contempt in the locker room,
lack of camaraderie and an overall bad
mood plagued the team.
Yet word has it that D'Antoni
wants to keep coaching. Good luck
with that.
The Lakers allowed 109.2 points
per game last season, the second
worst defensive team in the league by
that statistic. They suffered their
worst defeat to any team when they
lost to the Clippers by 48 points and
had a dismal 14-27 record at home.
Gasol openly criticized D'Antoni's
"small-ball approach" to the game and
was backed by Bryant. If the two lead
ers of the team are against the coach,
that negative vibe is going to spread to
the rest of the team, which it did.
So you can see why I would be ex
cited to see what's in store for next
season because it really can't get any
worse. And considering it's the Lak
ers, one of the most lucrative, well
known and successful franchises in
NBA history, you have to have faith
that something will be fixed and their
tradition of excellence will be restored
once again.

Ashley Westhem hid her Los Ange
les Clippers jersey in the closet be
fore writing this column but is plan
ning to bring it back out for their
game this Tuesday. To tell Ashley
why Lakers fans dorft root for the
Clippers in the playoffs, contact her
at awesthem@stanford.edu and
tweet her @ashwest!6.

Now there's a
chance for a
fresh start with
a new coach
and hopefully
a healthy
Kobe.
