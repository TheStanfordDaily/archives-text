# TOURNEY ENDS EARLY
## Stanford falls to Duke in first round 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
A promising season came to an
end last Friday for No. 19 Stanford
lacrosse (14-5) as the Card fell to No.
9 Duke (10-9) in the first round of the
NCAA Tournament 13-8, knocking
them out of the tournament. Stanford
had received an at-large bid to the
tournament after losing 14-11 in the
MPSF Tournament final against
Denver but was unable to advance
past the opening round.
Duke led the whole way after the
Blue Devils scored three goals in the
first minute of the game to take a 3-0
lead. The Blue Devils' high-powered
offense scored goals in bunches
throughout the game, as they would
later score two goals in a span of 12
seconds and also closed out the game
with three goals in 40 seconds.
"I did think we could recover,"
said head coach Amy Bokker to
GoStanford.com. "We've had deficits
early in games before. But a lot of
credit to Duke, they did a good job of
going hard to the net and taking ad
vantage of what we gave them. We
dug ourselves a hole and it was really
hard to recover."
Despite opening on a sour note,
Stanford fought back to cut the lead
to only 4-3 with 6:14 remaining in the
first half. Recognizing that she might
be playing her last game in a Cardinal
uniform, senior Rachel Ozer trig
gered a rally by scoring the team's
first goal and her team-leading 33rd
goal of the season with 17:26 remain
ing after nearly 12 minutes of score
less play.
The positive momentum was
somewhat dampened when Duke
scored two more goals with under a
minute remaining in the first half to
stretch the lead back to 6-3. However,
with only 21 seconds remaining in the
half, junior Meredith Kalinowski
notched her second goal of the season
on a free position shot to send the
match to halftime with Stanford trail
ing 6-4. Kalinowski would finish her
season with two goals and six assists
in 18 games.
Even though they found them
selves behind at the half, the Cardinal
hoped to draw on the confidence they
gained from three second-half rallies
earlier this season. Against Ohio
State to open the season, the Stan
ford trailed the Buckeyes 7-5 before
the Cardinal outscored them 6-2 in
