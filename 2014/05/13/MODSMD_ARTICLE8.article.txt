# TOURNEY ENDS EARLY
## Stanford falls to Duke in first round 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
A promising season came to an
end last Friday for No. 19 Stanford
lacrosse (14-5) as the Card fell to No.
9 Duke (10-9) in the first round of the
NCAA Tournament 13-8, knocking
them out of the tournament. Stanford
had received an at-large bid to the
tournament after losing 14-11 in the
MPSF Tournament final against
Denver but was unable to advance
past the opening round.
Duke led the whole way after the
Blue Devils scored three goals in the
first minute of the game to take a 3-0
lead. The Blue Devils' high-powered
offense scored goals in bunches
throughout the game, as they would
later score two goals in a span of 12
seconds and also closed out the game
with three goals in 40 seconds.
"I did think we could recover,"
said head coach Amy Bokker to
GoStanford.com. "We've had deficits
early in games before. But a lot of
credit to Duke, they did a good job of
going hard to the net and taking ad
vantage of what we gave them. We
dug ourselves a hole and it was really
hard to recover."
Despite opening on a sour note,
Stanford fought back to cut the lead
to only 4-3 with 6:14 remaining in the
first half. Recognizing that she might
be playing her last game in a Cardinal
uniform, senior Rachel Ozer trig
gered a rally by scoring the team's
first goal and her team-leading 33rd
goal of the season with 17:26 remain
ing after nearly 12 minutes of score
less play.
The positive momentum was
somewhat dampened when Duke
scored two more goals with under a
minute remaining in the first half to
stretch the lead back to 6-3. However,
with only 21 seconds remaining in the
half, junior Meredith Kalinowski
notched her second goal of the season
on a free position shot to send the
match to halftime with Stanford trail
ing 6-4. Kalinowski would finish her
season with two goals and six assists
in 18 games.
Even though they found them
selves behind at the half, the Cardinal
hoped to draw on the confidence they
gained from three second-half rallies
earlier this season. Against Ohio
State to open the season, the Stan
ford trailed the Buckeyes 7-5 before
the Cardinal outscored them 6-2 in

the second half to win 11-9. In
March, the Card trailed 7-3
at halftime against George
town before flipping the
script in the second half en
route to an overtime victory.
Three games later, Stanford
engineered yet another
comeback against Notre
Dame, winning 11-10 after
falling behind 8-5 at the half.
This time, though, the
Card couldn't pull off the
comeback victory as Duke
led by at least two goals
throughout the entire second
half. Ozer scored her second
goal of the game and 34th of
the season with 24:37 left in
the game to pull Stanford to
within two at 7-5. After the
Blue Devils scored two
straight to increase the lead
back to four, sophomore
Alexandra Crerend scored
twice to put Stanford again
within two. Crerend would
lead the Cardinal with three
goals and five draw controls
in the game, both career
highs for the sophomore.
The Blue Devils then pro
ceeded to close out the game,
limiting the Card to only one
goal in the final 14 minutes
a goal from freshman
Kelsey Murray, her 26th of
the season with stout de
fense while scoring four
themselves. Two empty-net

goals officially closed the
game to deliver a 13-8 victory
for Duke.
"Their defense played re
ally well, but I thought we
needed to do a better job of
driving hard to the net and
getting our shoulders in and
creating opportunities for
ourselves," Bokker said. "We
have some really great
dodgers on our team. We just
need to play fierce."
The loss was the final
game for seniors Ozer, Anna
Kim, Megan Lerner, Lynd
sey Munoz and Nina Swan
son. Ozer had a career year
as a senior, leading the team
with 34 goals and 47 points.
Kim, Lerner, Munoz and
Swanson all played in 18
games this season, and Kim
also finished the season with
15 goals and five assists. This
year's senior class matched
last year's with three NCAA
Tournament appearances in
four years, the best mark in
program history.
The 14-5 season for Stan
ford was its best year since
2011, when the Card went 16-
3 and finished the regular
season ranked No. 7 in the
nation before falling in the
first round of the NCAA
Tournament 13-11 to Florida
in Gainesville.
Stanford lacrosse will
look to build on a successful
season when next season be
gins in February of 2015.

A promising season came to an
end last Friday for No. 19 Stanford
lacrosse (14-5) as the Card fell to No.
9 Duke (10-9) in the first round of the
NCAA Tournament 13-8, knocking
them out of the tournament. Stanford
had received an at-large bid to the
tournament after losing 14-11 in the
MPSF Tournament final against
Denver but was unable to advance
past the opening round.
Duke led the whole way after the
Blue Devils scored three goals in the
first minute of the game to take a 3-0
lead. The Blue Devils' high-powered
offense scored goals in bunches
throughout the game, as they would
later score two goals in a span of 12
seconds and also closed out the game
with three goals in 40 seconds.
"I did think we could recover,"
said head coach Amy Bokker to
GoStanford.com. "We've had deficits
early in games before. But a lot of
credit to Duke, they did a good job of
going hard to the net and taking ad
vantage of what we gave them. We
dug ourselves a hole and it was really
hard to recover."
Despite opening on a sour note,
Stanford fought back to cut the lead
to only 4-3 with 6:14 remaining in the
first half. Recognizing that she might
be playing her last game in a Cardinal
uniform, senior Rachel Ozer trig
gered a rally by scoring the team's
first goal and her team-leading 33rd
goal of the season with 17:26 remain
ing after nearly 12 minutes of score
less play.
The positive momentum was
somewhat dampened when Duke
scored two more goals with under a
minute remaining in the first half to
stretch the lead back to 6-3. However,
with only 21 seconds remaining in the
half, junior Meredith Kalinowski
notched her second goal of the season
on a free position shot to send the
match to halftime with Stanford trail
ing 6-4. Kalinowski would finish her
season with two goals and six assists
in 18 games.
Even though they found them
selves behind at the half, the Cardinal
hoped to draw on the confidence they
gained from three second-half rallies
earlier this season. Against Ohio
State to open the season, the Stan
ford trailed the Buckeyes 7-5 before
the Cardinal outscored them 6-2 in

the second half to win 11-9. In
March, the Card trailed 7-3
at halftime against George
town before flipping the
script in the second half en
route to an overtime victory.
Three games later, Stanford
engineered yet another
comeback against Notre
Dame, winning 11-10 after
falling behind 8-5 at the half.
This time, though, the
Card couldn't pull off the
comeback victory as Duke
led by at least two goals
throughout the entire second
half. Ozer scored her second
goal of the game and 34th of
the season with 24:37 left in
the game to pull Stanford to
within two at 7-5. After the
Blue Devils scored two
straight to increase the lead
back to four, sophomore
Alexandra Crerend scored
twice to put Stanford again
within two. Crerend would
lead the Cardinal with three
goals and five draw controls
in the game, both career
highs for the sophomore.
The Blue Devils then pro
ceeded to close out the game,
limiting the Card to only one
goal in the final 14 minutes
a goal from freshman
Kelsey Murray, her 26th of
the season with stout de
fense while scoring four
themselves. Two empty-net

goals officially closed the
game to deliver a 13-8 victory
for Duke.
"Their defense played re
ally well, but I thought we
needed to do a better job of
driving hard to the net and
getting our shoulders in and
creating opportunities for
ourselves," Bokker said. "We
have some really great
dodgers on our team. We just
need to play fierce."
The loss was the final
game for seniors Ozer, Anna
Kim, Megan Lerner, Lynd

son. Ozer had a career year
as a senior, leading the team
with 34 goals and 47 points.
