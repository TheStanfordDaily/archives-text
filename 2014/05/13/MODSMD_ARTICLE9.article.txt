# Fighting to the finish
## Stanford wins series at Arizona 
### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
Stanford baseball kept
rolling this past weekend in the
desert, as it took two out of
three from reeling Arizona (19-
30, 8-19 Pac-12). It was a far
cry from the Cardinal's per
formance during their last visit
to Hi Corbett Field in 2012,
when the eventual national
champions swept them. Stan
ford (24-21,11-13) was able to
put both offense and pitching
together after dropping the
opener 3-2 in 10 innings on Fri
day, rallying for a 10-6 win on
Saturday and a 5-3 victory on
Sunday to take the series.
"The key for us was two
great pitching performances
by the two left-handers.
Hochstatter again pitched an
other great game and Logan
James did a great job," said

with three RBIs in the series victory against Arizona. Stanford has now
won six of its last eight games in a late-season surge towards the postseason.
