# Fighting to the finish
## Stanford wins series at Arizona 
### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
Stanford baseball kept
rolling this past weekend in the
desert, as it took two out of
three from reeling Arizona (19-
30, 8-19 Pac-12). It was a far
cry from the Cardinal's per
formance during their last visit
to Hi Corbett Field in 2012,
when the eventual national
champions swept them. Stan
ford (24-21,11-13) was able to
put both offense and pitching
together after dropping the
opener 3-2 in 10 innings on Fri
day, rallying for a 10-6 win on
Saturday and a 5-3 victory on
Sunday to take the series.
"The key for us was two
great pitching performances
by the two left-handers.
Hochstatter again pitched an
other great game and Logan
James did a great job," said

won six of its last eight games in a late-season surge towards the postseason.
head coach Mark Marquess.
"Especially after being one
strike away from winning
that Friday night game, it
was huge that we came back
and won two."
Stanford's starters went
2-0 with a 2.70 ERA in the
three-game set one of the
team's better pitching per
formances of late. Freshman
Cal Quantrill rallied for his
strongest outing since April 5
against Oregon State, as he
allowed just one run over 7.2
innings. He departed with a
2-1 lead in the eighth, giving
way to senior closer A.J.
Vanegas. For the second time
in three appearances, Vane
gas blew the save opportuni
ty — this one coming after
surrendering a single with an
0-2 count and two outs in the
ninth. In the bottom of the
10th, the Wildcats rallied for
another run with two outs for
a walk-off victory.
Meanwhile, junior John
Hochstatter and sophomore
Logan James, both south
paws who began the season
in the bullpen in favor of
freshman starting pitchers,
also went deep into their re
spective games and con
tributed to key wins.
Hochstatter finished one
out shy of a complete game
on Saturday, allowing six

runs four earned over
8.2 innings. He earned his
fifth win in as many tries as a
starter, a span over which he
has allowed just eight earned
runs over 41.1 innings for a
1.74 ERA.
James, in his third start of
the season, lasted a season
long seven innings, shutting
out the Wildcats until he al
lowed two runners in the
eighth that went on to score
after freshman Brett
Hanewich came on in relief.
Still, he earned the win after
the Cardinal offense treated
him to an early lead with a
five-run third inning in which
it knocked four of its six hits
in the game. As a starter,
James improved to 2-0 with a
1.80 ERA.
"The fastball I was throw
ing nearly 80 percent of the
time," said James of his most
recent outing. "The fastball
had good movement and ve
locity, so it felt good. Reliev
ing, I got in my own head a lit
tle bit, got nervous. But
starting, I've been able to
free my mind."
Stanford's offense has
also exploded of late, as it has
a .297/.370/.403 mark over
the team's last eight games,
in which the Cardinal own a
6-2 record. On Saturday the
Cardinal tallied 20 hits, their
most since 2012, as every
player in the starting lineup
had at least one hit to give
Hochstatter a cushion to
work with. The team hit .488
(20-for-41) in the game and a

combined .330 (36-for-109) in
the series. Arizona's pitching
ranks second-to-last in the
Pac-12 with a 4.67 ERA.
Junior Austin Slater has
continued to rake, as he has
improved his season batting
average to a team-high .337
over his nine-game hitting
streak. Over that stretch, he
has hit .486 (17-for-35) with
10 RBIs and six runs scored.
Sophomore two-sport
athlete Zach Hoffpauir has
also come along at the plate
of late, as he is currently rid
ing a seven-game hitting
streak in which he has car
ried a .538 batting average
(14-for-26) and five RBIs.
"Zach is really coming
into his own as a hitter," Mar
quess said. "He's hitting the
breaking ball, he's hitting the
ball to right field. He's
pulling the ball. They used to
try to get him out with the
non-fastball and they can't do
that anymore. He's really
matured into a really good
hitter."
Stanford's next contest
starts tonight at 5:30 p.m.
against San Jose State (17-
36,10-20 Mountain West), be
ginning a five-game homes
tand in which the team will
also welcome Washington
State for a three-game set
over the weekend followed
by Pacific next Tuesday.
This will be the second
game this season between
the two teams, after the Car
dinal blew out the Spartans,
9-3, in their fourth game of

the season. Freshman Tyler
Thorne had a strong outing
in which he allowed three
runs one earned over
six innings and the offense
backed him up with 14 hits.
Slater went 2-for-3 with
three RBIs and three runs
scored in the game.
Freshman Chris Viall will
make the start for Stanford,
in his first since April 6 at
Oregon State. After being re
moved from the rotation
after consecutive outings
lasting just 1.1 innings, Viall
has improved in his six ap
pearances out of the bullpen
since then allowing just
three runs over 11.2 innings
for a 2.31 ERA.
Down the stretch run of
its regular season, Stanford
needs to take care of business
against lesser competition
who have a .411 combined
winning percentage in
order to assure its position
near the top of the national
RPI ranking, which plays a
big role in determining post
season berths and position
ing.
"It's all RPI," Marquess
said. "That's why we didn't
make it last year even though
we were 16-14 in the league.
It's just the opposite this
year where our overall
record isn't as good, but our
RPI is good. We'll see if that
makes a difference but we
have to keep playing."

team's better pitching per
formances of late. Freshman
Cal Quantrill rallied for his
strongest outing since April 5
against Oregon State, as he
allowed just one run over 7.2
innings. He departed with a
2-1 lead in the eighth, giving
way to senior closer A.J.
Vanegas. For the second time
in three appearances, Vane
gas blew the save opportuni
ty — this one coming after
surrendering a single with an
0-2 count and two outs in the
ninth. In the bottom of the
10th, the Wildcats rallied for
another run with two outs for
a walk-off victory.
Meanwhile, junior John
Hochstatter and sophomore
Logan James, both south
paws who began the season
in the bullpen in favor of
freshman starting pitchers,
also went deep into their re
spective games and con
tributed to key wins.
Hochstatter finished one
out shy of a complete game
on Saturday, allowing six

runs four earned over
8.2 innings. He earned his
fifth win in as many tries as a
starter, a span over which he
has allowed just eight earned
runs over 41.1 innings for a
1.74 ERA.
James, in his third start of
the season, lasted a season
long seven innings, shutting
out the Wildcats until he al
lowed two runners in the
eighth that went on to score
after freshman Brett
Hanewich came on in relief.
Still, he earned the win after
the Cardinal offense treated
him to an early lead with a
five-run third inning in which
it knocked four of its six hits
in the game. As a starter,
James improved to 2-0 with a
1.80 ERA.
"The fastball I was throw
ing nearly 80 percent of the
time," said James of his most
recent outing. "The fastball
had good movement and ve
locity, so it felt good. Reliev
ing, I got in my own head a lit
tle bit, got nervous. But
starting, I've been able to
free my mind."
Stanford's offense has
also exploded of late, as it has
a .297/.370/.403 mark over
the team's last eight games,
in which the Cardinal own a
6-2 record. On Saturday the
Cardinal tallied 20 hits, their
most since 2012, as every
player in the starting lineup
had at least one hit to give
Hochstatter a cushion to
work with. The team hit .488
(20-for-41) in the game and a

combined .330 (36-for-109) in
the series. Arizona's pitching
ranks second-to-last in the
Pac-12 with a 4.67 ERA.
Junior Austin Slater has
continued to rake, as he has
improved his season batting
average to a team-high .337
over his nine-game hitting
streak. Over that stretch, he
has hit .486 (17-for-35) with
10 RBIs and six runs scored.
Sophomore two-sport
athlete Zach Hoffpauir has
also come along at the plate
of late, as he is currently rid
ing a seven-game hitting
streak in which he has car
ried a .538 batting average
(14-for-26) and five RBIs.
"Zach is really coming
into his own as a hitter," Mar
quess said. "He's hitting the
breaking ball, he's hitting the
ball to right field. He's
pulling the ball. They used to
try to get him out with the
non-fastball and they can't do
that anymore. He's really
matured into a really good
hitter."
Stanford's next contest
starts tonight at 5:30 p.m.
against San Jose State (17-
36,10-20 Mountain West), be
ginning a five-game homes
tand in which the team will
also welcome Washington
State for a three-game set
over the weekend followed
by Pacific next Tuesday.
This will be the second
game this season between
the two teams, after the Car
dinal blew out the Spartans,
9-3, in their fourth game of

the season. Freshman Tyler
Thorne had a strong outing
in which he allowed three
runs one earned over
six innings and the offense
backed him up with 14 hits.
Slater went 2-for-3 with
three RBIs and three runs
scored in the game.
Freshman Chris Viall will
make the start for Stanford,
in his first since April 6 at
Oregon State. After being re
moved from the rotation
after consecutive outings
lasting just 1.1 innings, Viall
has improved in his six ap
pearances out of the bullpen
since then allowing just
three runs over 11.2 innings
for a 2.31 ERA.
Down the stretch run of
its regular season, Stanford
needs to take care of business
against lesser competition
who have a .411 combined
winning percentage in
order to assure its position
near the top of the national
RPI ranking, which plays a
big role in determining post
season berths and position
ing.
"It's all RPI," Marquess
said. "That's why we didn't
make it last year even though
we were 16-14 in the league.
It's just the opposite this
year where our overall
record isn't as good, but our
RPI is good. We'll see if that
makes a difference but we
have to keep playing."

Stanford baseball kept
rolling this past weekend in the
desert, as it took two out of
three from reeling Arizona (19-
30, 8-19 Pac-12). It was a far
cry from the Cardinal's per
formance during their last visit
to Hi Corbett Field in 2012,
when the eventual national
champions swept them. Stan
ford (24-21,11-13) was able to
put both offense and pitching
together after dropping the
opener 3-2 in 10 innings on Fri
day, rallying for a 10-6 win on
Saturday and a 5-3 victory on
Sunday to take the series.
"The key for us was two
great pitching performances
by the two left-handers.
Hochstatter again pitched an
other great game and Logan
James did a great job," said
