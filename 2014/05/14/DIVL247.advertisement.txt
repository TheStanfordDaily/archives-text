Join us at the Nitery for an unforgettable evening
of live storytelling! Students will perform stories
they've developed throughout the quarter in the
course Story Craft, taught by TAPS faculty and improv
guru Dan Klein and director Michelle Darby.
Story Night is free and open to the public. Come
early—hot chocolate and cookies will be served
before the performance!
enthrall, rivet, delight, spellbind, captivate, engross, enchant, transport, intrigue, hook.
