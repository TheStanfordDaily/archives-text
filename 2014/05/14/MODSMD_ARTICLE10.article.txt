## SEEING GREEN To boldly go... 
### Holly Moeller 
The press release announcing
the loss of the unmanned sub
mersible Nereus reads like
the obituary of an old, deeply
beloved and respected friend. As
well it should, since that's what
Nereus was to her dedicated team
of human handlers, who spent six
years using it to explore the ocean's
depths.

Built to withstand 1,000 atmos
pheres of pressure, Nereus had
seen the bottom of the Mariana
Trench (the ocean's deepest point)
and discovered new hydrothermal
vents, collected samples and laid
down instruments for a host of sci
entific projects. The deep-sea robot
could operate either autonomously
or on a tether to a surface ship; at
the time of her demise, she was 6.2
miles (10 kilometers) deep in the
Kermadec Trench, a plummeting pit
in the Pacific Ocean northeast of
New Zealand.

Almost 24 hours after the oper
ating surface ship lost contact with
Nereus last Saturday, fragments of
the submersible bobbed to the sur
face. It seems that the vessel was
lost to an implosion: At 16,000
pounds per square inch of pressure,
the slightest imperfection can result
in a catastrophic failure.
Members of the team accompa
nying Nereus compared her loss to
the loss of a child. The analogy high
lights the intimacy of this particular
scientist-instrument relationship: a
sometimes-finicky robot that
nonetheless united dozens of scien
tists shipboard (and hundreds of
land-based onlookers, on the occa
sions when Nereus 1 s explorations
were broadcast live over the inter
net) on a common scientific mission
of exploration.

Though nothing can soften the
blow of Nereus's fate, at least in
this case, no human lives were lost.
Yes, people like filmmaker
James Cameron who wrote a let
ter to Woods Hole Oceanographic

Institution expressing his condo
lences on the loss of Nereus
may still mount manned expeditions
to the sea floor. But Nereus, a pio
neer among robotic deep-sea ex
plorers, was a member of the true
workhorses of today's oceanic ex
ploration the robots that boldly
go where no man has gone before
and likely no man will follow.
We have a deep and abiding faith
in human perception in the abili
ty of the human senses to collect
data and the human brain to assimi
late these data into insights that
only an on-the-ground (or in-the
water) observer could obtain. Yet as
our technology advances, it be
comes increasingly capable of doing
a human's job as well as and in
some cases, better than humans
themselves, and moreover, the use
of robots avoids risking human life.

Truly far-ranging
exploration is best
left to robots;
scientists prioritize
funding for
unmanned missions.

Our fleet of sea explorers
includes far-ranging gliders,
passively drifting buoys and
Nereus's successors, the
Nereids. Robots are taking
over our more hazardous
(and tedious) jobs on land as
well: defusing bombs, doing
surveillance and tending
crops. And we've turned over
our space exploration to
probes and rovers that leave
the surface of our planet,
never to return.
In fact, in 2010, President
Barack Obama announced
the shutdown of the govern
ment's manned space shuttle
program. The task of putting
humans in space has been
turned over to the private sec
tor; the truly far-ranging ex
ploration is best left to robots.
This makes economic
sense as well as sense
safety-wise. Supporting
human life in space partic
ularly for the vast amounts of
time required to traverse
even our own planetary sys
tem is infinitely more
complicated than simply
transporting machinery. At a
minimum, humans require
food, water and oxygen for
the journey all of which
take up space, require money
and induce logistical night
mares. And while there

would surely be no shortage
of volunteers for a one-way
trip to Mars, such a venture
would be more stunt than ac
tual scientific progression.
Since the practicalities of
unmanned exploration seem
so obvious, I was surprised
when a survey of scientists
conducted by the esteemed
journal Nature revealed
how heavily they supported
manned space flight. Many
of the 800 scientists surveyed
cited the Apollo missions to
the moon as inspiration for
their careers in science and
manned missions as impor
tant to the pursuit of science.
Yet even they would priori
tize funding for unmanned
missions.
This shift will be cement
ed by future generations of
scientists. Neil Armstrong's
first steps on the moon may
have inspired my parents'
generation, but they long
pre-dated mine. Instead, I
remember the sleek yellow
cylinder of the Rutgers Uni
versity glider, hanging in the
atrium of the Institute of Ma
rine and Coastal Sciences. I
walked beneath it almost
every day for two years, a
constant reminder of the vast
new frontier opened to us by
automated exploration.
