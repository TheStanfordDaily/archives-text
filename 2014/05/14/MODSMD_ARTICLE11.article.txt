## Democrats, don't fight on Benghazi 
### Josh Jones 
The decision of Speaker John
Boehner and other House Re
publicans to establish a select
committee to investigate the Beng
hazi attacks of September 11, 2012,
has been predictably controversial.
Ever since the tragedy occurred
in the midst of President Obama's
2012 reelection campaign, no less
the issue has become increasingly
partisan, with Democrats rolling
their eyes any time Republicans re
visit the "phony scandal."
It was with not a little exaspera

pages of text already uncovered by
prior investigations. And denounc

Libyan ambassador that Benghazi
was an attack carried out by extrem

military also believed the same.
Yet even as Libyan President Mo
hamed Mogariaf asserted that "[t]he
idea that this criminal and cowardly
act was a spontaneous protest that
just spun out of control is completely
unfounded and preposterous," the
State Department altered the CIA
talking points for U.N. Ambassador
Susan Rice. Rice, who appeared on
all five major Sunday talk shows to
explain the Obama Administration's
point of view, maintained: "In fact,
this was not a preplanned, pre
