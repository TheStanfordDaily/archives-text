## Democrats, don't fight on Benghazi 
### Josh Jones 
The decision of Speaker John
Boehner and other House Re
publicans to establish a select
committee to investigate the Beng
hazi attacks of September 11, 2012,
has been predictably controversial.
Ever since the tragedy occurred
in the midst of President Obama's
2012 reelection campaign, no less
the issue has become increasingly
partisan, with Democrats rolling
their eyes any time Republicans re
visit the "phony scandal."
It was with not a little exaspera
tion last week that Democrats re
minded Republicans of the 13 hear
ings, 50 briefings and thousands of
pages of text already uncovered by
prior investigations. And denounc
ing the select committee as a "kanga
roo court," many on the left have
claimed that the select committee is
nothing more than an effort to ener
gize the GOP base in a midterm elec
tion year.
But this is not a good position for
Democrats to take. For one, it would
be foolish to deny that a lot did go
wrong in Benghazi both before
and after the killings. From the
seven congressional hearings to
date, it is clear that the State Depart
ment repeatedly ignored requests
for heightened security at the Amer

ican compound there. It is also evi
dent that as quickly as the day after
the tragedy, State Department offi
cial Elizabeth Jones informed the
Libyan ambassador that Benghazi
was an attack carried out by extrem
ists affiliated with the terrorist net
work Ansar al-Sharia. The CIA and
military also believed the same.
Yet even as Libyan President Mo
hamed Mogariaf asserted that "[t]he
idea that this criminal and cowardly
act was a spontaneous protest that
just spun out of control is completely
unfounded and preposterous," the
State Department altered the CIA
talking points for U.N. Ambassador
Susan Rice. Rice, who appeared on
all five major Sunday talk shows to
explain the Obama Administration's
point of view, maintained: "In fact,
this was not a preplanned, pre
meditated attack!;] what happened


initially was that it was a
spontaneous reaction to what
had just transpired in Cairo as
a consequence of the video."

The most recent select
committee was formed in re
sponse to an email released
just this month, which reveals
that Rice was specifically in
structed to make clear that
protests in the Middle East
were "rooted in an Internet
video, and not a broader fail
ure of policy."
Yes, former Secretary of
State Clinton long ago accept
ed responsibility for the mis
takes made on her watch and
resigned from her post short
ly thereafter. But to this day,
not one individual has been
fired or properly held ac
countable for the failures at
Benghazi.
Regardless of these facts,
there is no doubt that the
worst thing Democrats can do
right now is exactly what
they're doing. Shortly after
the announcement, Democ
rats threatened to boycott the
select committee if, amongst
other things, they were not al
lowed to preapprove all wit
nesses.

It is hard to imagine a
worse strategy. Instead, the
Democrats should help the
Republicans proceed full
speed ahead. If there is truly
nothing left to find, the GOP
will waste precious political
capital chasing a scandal that
never was. Few things would

be more embarrassing or po
litically damaging to the Re
publican Party than holding
yet another Benghazi investi
gation only to come up empty.
On the other hand, any at
tempt to stonewall the
process only perpetuates the
appearance of wrongdoing or
a cover-up on the part of the
Administration.

Many are understandably
frustrated when lawmakers
grandstand or continually re
hash the same battles over
and over again. In reality, the
fact that both parties tend to
fixate so much on certain is
sues â€” say, the Republicans
on Obamacare or the Democ
rats on the minimum wage
is actually a sign of a healthy
democracy. After all, isn't the
whole point of having repre
sentative government to elect
legislators and administra
tors who carry out the will of
the people?
The priorities of the peo
ple should always be the pri
orities of its politicians. If con
stituents are urging their rep
resentatives to dig deeper
into Benghazi a recent
Rasmussen poll confirmed
that 51 percent of Americans
believe the issue merits fur
ther investigation then
that is exactly what politi
cians should spend them time
doing. And if lawmakers mis
read our true needs or de
sires, it is our responsibility
and ours alone to send that
message at the ballot box.
Soon we will have the oppor
tunity to do just that.
