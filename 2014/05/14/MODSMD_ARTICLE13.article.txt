## Rethinking the Stanford classroom 
### Vihan Lakshman 
It's 7:30 a.m. A loud screeching
sound pierces your eardrums.
You get up, slam your alarm clock
into submission and decide to back to
sleep "for five more minutes" before
getting ready for your 9 a.m. class.
Now it's magically 9:05 and you
race out of bed, you furiously pedal
through a blur of palm trees and red
roofs. You arrive at class and slither
through a mass of bodies to the one
empty seat invariably in the mid
dle of a long row. Meanwhile, the pro
fessor is in the midst of a wonderful
performance on center stage, albeit
one at warp speed. You manage to
scribble a few notes here and there,
but you leave without any real idea of
what's going on. Then when that
problem set or paper rolls out you
find yourself scrambling to grapple
with the material because those lec
tures don't really provide away to en
gage with the subject on a personal
level.

But wait. There is an answer to
this vicious educational cycle, you
say? Something so utterly revolution
ary and profound that it makes the
poor little printing press look like an
overrated method of spilling ink: the
flipped classroom.

In all seriousness, the flipped
classroom model does address many
of the complaints over the structure of
university learning that I mentioned
above; students watch lectures online
at a time and place of their conven

ience (which I would venture to guess
is not 9 a.m. at a lecture hall) under the
auspices of the holy pause button.
With the ability to go back and re
watch sections, no lecture is too fast.
Class time is then spent working
through problems or discussing ideas
in small groups to clarify doubts and
reinforce the insights that are neces
sary to tackle the class assignments.
In fact, this model sounds ab
solutely perfect. It is undoubtedly the
ideal cure to all of our learning mal
adies, the technological messiah that
has finally descended from the heav
en to save students' grades. The
flipped classroom has arrived to
change education forever, and we are
the fortunate perhaps even un
worthy beneficiaries.
But, in the immortal words of Lee
Corso: "Not so fast, my friend."
The flipped classroom model cer
tainly presents some tremendously
useful elements, but is it really an ed
ucational panacea? Should we feel ob
ligated to use this technology just be
cause it exists?
I think these are vital questions to
answer for the future of higher educa
tion and especially at Stanford, where
cutting-edge technology and a recep
tiveness to experimentation nicely
go hand-in-hand. Ultimately, I think
flipped classrooms make a lot of
sense in very specific contexts, but
they remain very much a work in
progress. We should really strive to
create a balance between the benefi
cial features of a traditional lecture
and technology when it too can be
beneficial. At this point at a time
when the very standard of education
delivery is in flux, challenged if not
overwhelmed by MOOCs and servic
es like Khan Academy we should
be willing to mix and match ideas in
stead of blindly clinging to one side in
the debate.
The most immediate arguments
against flipped classrooms tend to
make a distinction between learning
and an overall educational experi
ence, suggesting that traditional lec
tures provide a valuable opportunity
to engage with a professor and share
ideas.
While some argue that the "class
time" component of the flipped class
room— in which students work in
small groups or engage in other inter
active activities captures this per
sonal aspect of a college education,

the evidence from actual Stanford
courses suggests courses are not im
plementing this feature effectively.
CSI47: Introduction to Human Com
puter Interaction has experimented
with flipped classrooms in past years
to mixed reviews and doubts over how
the course was implemented. MS&E
111: Introduction to Optimization re
ceived course ratings on Axess well
below the department average. In
particular, students were dissatisfied
with the course's lack of personal at
tention.
And that I think sums up
the main shortcoming of today's
flipped classrooms: how they are put
into practice. While the basic idea of
watching lecture videos at home and
experiencing more personalized
learning in class makes sense, it
rarely seems to translate into a
seamless system in reality. I think
that stems from an overzealousness
to rush into a flipped classroom
model. Stanford Medical School, for
example, has fully embraced the idea
of delivering information through
lecture videos, but the transition can
be difficult at the start. For starters,
creating lecture videos (if none exist
already) can be a taxing process for
faculty members. Furthermore, it
can be difficult to design a beneficial
in-class experience on the first try.
In the end, I think flipped class
rooms will become more of the norm,
because the benefit of watching lec
ture videos on a flexible schedule will
be too much to pass up. For now,
though, I think we should tread slow
ly and avoid operating under the men
tality that instructors should use
technology just because it exists. For
now, perhaps courses can try adding
lecture videos in advance and experi
menting with a more interactive
classroom.
While many critics have noted
that this mixing and matching of the
two learning models creates many of
the problems we see today, I think
that if we take it slow enough, the
change will be unnoticeable. Flipped
classrooms show a tremendous
amount of promise because they have
the ability to turn a large lecture into
something resembling a small, inter
active seminai; but the key is in the
implementation.
Until then, though, I see absolute
ly no harm in going to bed a little ear
lier for that 9 a.m. class and trying to
get the most out of that lecture. After
all, it's worked for hundreds and hun
dreds of years.

ience (which I would venture to guess
is not 9 a.m. at a lecture hall) under the
auspices of the holy pause button.
With the ability to go back and re
watch sections, no lecture is too fast.
Class time is then spent working
through problems or discussing ideas
in small groups to clarify doubts and
reinforce the insights that are neces
sary to tackle the class assignments.
In fact, this model sounds ab
solutely perfect. It is undoubtedly the
ideal cure to all of our learning mal
adies, the technological messiah that
has finally descended from the heav
en to save students' grades. The
flipped classroom has arrived to
change education forever, and we are
the fortunate perhaps even un
worthy beneficiaries.
But, in the immortal words of Lee
Corso: "Not so fast, my friend."
The flipped classroom model cer
tainly presents some tremendously
useful elements, but is it really an ed
ucational panacea? Should we feel ob
ligated to use this technology just be
cause it exists?
I think these are vital questions to
answer for the future of higher educa
tion and especially at Stanford, where
cutting-edge technology and a recep
tiveness to experimentation nicely
go hand-in-hand. Ultimately, I think
flipped classrooms make a lot of
sense in very specific contexts, but
they remain very much a work in
progress. We should really strive to
create a balance between the benefi
cial features of a traditional lecture
and technology when it too can be
beneficial. At this point at a time
when the very standard of education
delivery is in flux, challenged if not
overwhelmed by MOOCs and servic
es like Khan Academy we should
be willing to mix and match ideas in
stead of blindly clinging to one side in
the debate.
The most immediate arguments
against flipped classrooms tend to
make a distinction between learning
and an overall educational experi
ence, suggesting that traditional lec
tures provide a valuable opportunity
to engage with a professor and share
ideas.
While some argue that the "class
time" component of the flipped class
room— in which students work in
small groups or engage in other inter
active activities captures this per
sonal aspect of a college education,

the evidence from actual Stanford
courses suggests courses are not im
plementing this feature effectively.
CSI47: Introduction to Human Com
puter Interaction has experimented
with flipped classrooms in past years
to mixed reviews and doubts over how
the course was implemented. MS&E
111: Introduction to Optimization re
ceived course ratings on Axess well
below the department average. In
particular, students were dissatisfied
with the course's lack of personal at
tention.
And that I think sums up
the main shortcoming of today's
flipped classrooms: how they are put
into practice. While the basic idea of
watching lecture videos at home and
experiencing more personalized
learning in class makes sense, it
rarely seems to translate into a
seamless system in reality. I think
that stems from an overzealousness
to rush into a flipped classroom
model. Stanford Medical School, for
example, has fully embraced the idea
of delivering information through
lecture videos, but the transition can
be difficult at the start. For starters,
creating lecture videos (if none exist
already) can be a taxing process for
faculty members. Furthermore, it
can be difficult to design a beneficial
in-class experience on the first try.
In the end, I think flipped class
rooms will become more of the norm,
because the benefit of watching lec
ture videos on a flexible schedule will
be too much to pass up. For now,
though, I think we should tread slow
ly and avoid operating under the men
tality that instructors should use
technology just because it exists. For
now, perhaps courses can try adding
lecture videos in advance and experi
menting with a more interactive
classroom.
While many critics have noted
that this mixing and matching of the
two learning models creates many of
the problems we see today, I think
that if we take it slow enough, the
change will be unnoticeable. Flipped
classrooms show a tremendous
amount of promise because they have
the ability to turn a large lecture into
something resembling a small, inter
active seminai; but the key is in the
implementation.
Until then, though, I see absolute
ly no harm in going to bed a little ear
lier for that 9 a.m. class and trying to
get the most out of that lecture. After
all, it's worked for hundreds and hun
dreds of years.

It's 7:30 a.m. A loud screeching
sound pierces your eardrums.
You get up, slam your alarm clock
into submission and decide to back to
sleep "for five more minutes" before
getting ready for your 9 a.m. class.
Now it's magically 9:05 and you
race out of bed, you furiously pedal
through a blur of palm trees and red
roofs. You arrive at class and slither
through a mass of bodies to the one
empty seat invariably in the mid
dle of a long row. Meanwhile, the pro
fessor is in the midst of a wonderful
performance on center stage, albeit
one at warp speed. You manage to
scribble a few notes here and there,
but you leave without any real idea of
what's going on. Then when that
problem set or paper rolls out you
find yourself scrambling to grapple
with the material because those lec
tures don't really provide away to en
gage with the subject on a personal
level.

But wait. There is an answer to
this vicious educational cycle, you
say? Something so utterly revolution
ary and profound that it makes the
poor little printing press look like an
overrated method of spilling ink: the
flipped classroom.

In all seriousness, the flipped
classroom model does address many
of the complaints over the structure of
