# STUDENT LIFE
## Students start diversity campaign 
### FIONA NOONAN STAFF WRITER 
Inspired by Harvard's "I, Too, Am Harvard," proj
ect, Stanford will soon be home to "Stanford RlSes:
Conversations on Race, Inequality, Sexuality and Gen
der," a new project created by EKela Autry 'l7 and
Rochelle Ballantyne 'l7.
When the "I, Too, Am Harvard" Tumblr was re
leased in early March in the form of a photo campaign, it
made a huge splash not only at the college level but also
across the country. The media blew up, Tumblr

where the photos were posted blew up.
And so did Stanford's Diaspora email list.
Autry and Ballantyne were included in the email
frenzy and became excited by the Harvard students' ef
forts to raise awareness about racial ignorance and ag
gression on campus through the campaign. Soon after,
they decided that Stanford should do something similar.
"I remember sending an email saying, 'Why isn't
Stanford doing this? We should totally do this!'" Autry
said.
