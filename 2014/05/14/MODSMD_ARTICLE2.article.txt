# STUDENT LIFE
## Students start diversity campaign 
### FIONA NOONAN STAFF WRITER 
Inspired by Harvard's "I, Too, Am Harvard," proj
ect, Stanford will soon be home to "Stanford RlSes:
Conversations on Race, Inequality, Sexuality and Gen
der," a new project created by EKela Autry 'l7 and
Rochelle Ballantyne 'l7.
When the "I, Too, Am Harvard" Tumblr was re
leased in early March in the form of a photo campaign, it
made a huge splash not only at the college level but also
across the country. The media blew up, Tumblr

where the photos were posted blew up.
And so did Stanford's Diaspora email list.
Autry and Ballantyne were included in the email
frenzy and became excited by the Harvard students' ef
forts to raise awareness about racial ignorance and ag
gression on campus through the campaign. Soon after,
they decided that Stanford should do something similar.
"I remember sending an email saying, 'Why isn't
Stanford doing this? We should totally do this!'" Autry
said.

Although she and Ballan
tyne considered the possibili
ty of creating an #ITooAm-
Stanford project, after
speaking with Jan Barker-
Alexander, associate dean of
students and the director at
the Black Community Servic
es Center, they realized that
what had worked for Har
vard may not necessarily be
appropriate at Stanford.
Outlets for conversations
about race and racism exist
here already, according to
Autry, so she and Ballantyne
began looking for a different
way to spark dialogue on cam
pus.
Thus, Stanford RlSes was
born, but instead of focusing
only on the black student pop
ulation, the project aims to
confront a broader set of is
sues.

"It's not only about black
people, it's about different
races and people who feel like
stereotypes affect them and
they need to be heard," Ballan
tyne said. "So it still is
#lTooAmStanford. It's just
we have our own twist on it."
The project encompasses
class, race, gender and sexual
ity in an attempt to give a voice
to students who may feel mar
ginalized by some aspect of
their identity. Similarly to
Harvard, the participants are
photographed with a white
board stating a common mis
perception or rejecting some
type of ignorance. They are
also interviewed about why
they want to participate in

Stanford RlSes and how they
feel about the way their identi
ty affects their Stanford expe
rience.
"A lot of the ones that I've
had are just other people's per
ceptions of them, or people try
ing to identify with them, but
it's like, 'You don't know how I
feel. You don't know what it's
like to be me,'" Autry said. "I
think that's really powerful."
So far, Autry and Ballan
tyne have had success with the
project 92 people from the
Diaspora list, where they've
found their interview subjects,
initially showed interest, and
so far the two have recorded
and photographed over 30
people.

Eventually, Autry and Bal
lantyne hope to put the re
sponses on a Tumblr page and
to facilitate a conversation
among the 92 original respon
dents.
Ultimately, the goal of
Stanford RlSes is to make all
students more comfortable
talking about topics that may
not necessarily affect them but
that certainly affect the
greater community, whether it
be sexuality, gender, class or
especially race.
"Stanford is an extremely
diverse campus, and race
should not be something that
people feel defensive about be
cause college is a place to open
up and to experience new
things and to talk about new
things," Ballantyne said. "If
race doesn't matter to you
then fine, whatever. But if
your friends aren't white,
then it's something that you
should expect to talk about."

"A lot of the ones that I've
had are just other people's per
ceptions of them, or people try
ing to identify with them, but
it's like, 'You don't know how I
feel. You don't know what it's
like to be me,'" Autry said. "I
think that's really powerful."
So far, Autry and Ballan
tyne have had success with the
project 92 people from the
Diaspora list, where they've
found their interview subjects,
initially showed interest, and
so far the two have recorded
and photographed over 30
people.

Eventually, Autry and Bal
lantyne hope to put the re
sponses on a Tumblr page and
to facilitate a conversation
among the 92 original respon
dents.
Ultimately, the goal of
Stanford RlSes is to make all
students more comfortable
talking about topics that may
not necessarily affect them but
that certainly affect the
greater community, whether it
be sexuality, gender, class or
especially race.
"Stanford is an extremely
diverse campus, and race
should not be something that
people feel defensive about be
cause college is a place to open
up and to experience new
things and to talk about new
things," Ballantyne said. "If
race doesn't matter to you
then fine, whatever. But if
your friends aren't white,
then it's something that you
should expect to talk about."

"It still is #lTooAmStanford. It's
just we have our own twist on it."
