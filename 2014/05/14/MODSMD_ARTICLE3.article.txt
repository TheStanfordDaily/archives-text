## Senate passes funding bill for groups Student groups concerned about ASSU responsiveness 
### PETER MOON DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Last night's meeting of the 16th
Undergraduate Senate saw the con
tinued discussion of the lack of fund
ing facing general fees groups.
Student group representatives,
including those from Students for
Reproductive Justice and Women's
Coalition, have repeatedly visited
ASSU Senate meetings over the
past few weeks desiring clarifica
tion about the spring quarter fund
ing bills. Some groups have also ap
pealed to the Senate about the vari
ous miscommunications that have
occurred these past few weeks.
"We don't understand why we
can't have general fees funding,"
said Simon Hudson 'l6, a member of
Challah for Hunger. "We have
reached out to the Senate Appropri
ations Committee and we received
no response. We don't understand
why overspending on your part has
prohibited giving funds to student
groups."
"We had $2,000 pulled from
events services fund," Hudson said.
"We bake challah and buy all the in
gredients, but the money has been
taken out without warning."
There have also been lingering
questions over whether the Senate
has been promptly responding to
student groups and whether there
has been a cooperative effort and
discussion of the various monetary
withholdings from student organi-
zations.
Chair Ben Holston 'l5 re
minded student groups that
the Senate meetings were
open to public.
In an effort to address
these student groups' con
cerns, the Senate drafted the
Bill to Appropriate General
Fee Reserves for Spring
Quarter General Fee Fund
ing. Taking into considera
tion the advice given by Stan
ford Student Enterprises
(SSE), the Senate decided to
use money from general fees
reserves as opposed to the
buffer fund reserves.

"Spending out of the
buffer fund and general fees
reserve are both bad, but
spending from the buffer
fund is worse," said Financial
Manager Frederick Groce.
"Buffer fund money is not
meant to go to student
groups, whereas the general
fees reserve is meant to go to
student groups. If the Senate
is going to pass another
bailout, the best option is to
take money out of general re

serve fee."
Furthermore, the former
assistant financial manager
Stephen Trusheim 'l3 M.S.
'l4 underscored the SSE's
relationship with the Senate,
explaining that taking money
from the buffer fund is not a
sustainable way of funding
student organizations.
"We are not here to veto
things," said Trusheim. "We
are here because we need to
help and monitor the finan
cial status of the Senate ...
[Most importantly], we still
haven't fixed the core under
lying issues that are causing
this funding problem."
However, many Senators
also expressed discontent
about the ambiguity of the
buffer fund and its purpose.
The current Senate Consti
tution and bylaws do not
specify the purpose of buffer
funds.

The Bill to Appropriate
General Fee Reserves for
Spring Quarter General Fee
Funding was passed by the
16th Senate, effectively al
lowing the Senate to allocate
$75,000 to fund student
groups this spring quarter.
