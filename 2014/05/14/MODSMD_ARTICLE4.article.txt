# FSI receives $5 million endowment
## Gift supports nuclear security professorship 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
Last month, the Freeman Spogli
Institute for International Studies
(FSI) accepted an endowment gift
of $5 million from the Stanton Foun
dation for establishing a professor
ship in nuclear security. Centered in
FSl's Center for International Se
curity and Cooperation (CISAC),
the professorship will allow Stan
ford to recruit a renowned scholar
for a joint appointment at FSI and
one of the University's seven
schools.
"This endowed position enables
us to deepen our expertise and
broaden our reach in all three areas
[of our three-part mission: research,
policy impact and teaching]," said
Amy Zegart M.A. '93 Ph.D. '96, co
director of CISAC. "We'll be able to
offer more courses related to nu
clear security and do more research
across disciplines at nuclear-related
matters, and those two activities will
in turn give us even more impact in
policy as well."
This endowment is the second of
such funds from the Stanton Foun
dation to FSI. Neil Penick, associate
director for development and exter
nal relations at FSI, attributed the
support from Stanton as part of an
established relationship between
the foundation and the Institute.
"We've had a very long relation
ship," Penick said. "In fact, the Stan
ton Foundation has supported post
doctoral fellowships for Ph.D. stu
dents or recent graduates who

have focused on nuclear security in
an effort to train the next genera
tion of nuclear specialists. I think
what the foundation came to con
clude was that they not only needed
to focus on the next generation but
needed to fund more senior faculty
to do the training and mentoring of
those young scholars."
The previous endowment last
year had allowed Rodney Ewing '72
Ph.D. '74, a leading researcher of
nuclear waste from the University
of Michigan, to join the School of
Earth Sciences and FSI, and, like
the first endowment, the second
round of funding will be used to
bring an additional scholar to the
University.
While FSI has not formally
opened a search, the Institute has
begun conversations about how to
conduct the search and about poten
tial candidates. The official search is
planned to begin in fall of this year,
and Zegart hopes that a chair for the
Stanton Foundation Professorship
in Nuclear Security will be found by
the end of the 2014-15 academic
year.
"We're open with respect to the
search," Zegart said. "There's a
broad range of candidates that we'll
look at and we don't have any pre
conceived notions about what disci
plines that we're going to [recruit
from]."
Ultimately, administrators be
lieve that the endowment will have
beneficial effects to the research en-
vironment and beyond on the
Stanford campus and in in
ternational policy.
"This partnership with
the Stanton Foundation real
ly cements CISAC and Stan
ford and FSI as one of the
leading research institutes
focused on international se
curity issues," Penick said.
"It's something we really
value and treasure, and
we're grateful for the foun
dation and their support.
We're very much looking for
ward to finding the right per

son to join the team."
"One of the exciting
things about a gift like this is
that an endowment has rip
ple effects across the Univer
sity and even the country,"
Zegart said. "To bring one
renowned scholar has expo
nential benefits for our stu
dents who take classes over
time, to graduates who will be
mentors, to our faculty who
will collaborate with them and
to international leaders who
will be affected by the re
search that this Stanton chair
will generate. There's poten
tial to impact so many people
across a long period of time."
