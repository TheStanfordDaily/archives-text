# KATE'S CRUSADE
## CYCLIST ONE OF STANFORD'S BEST-KEPT SECRETS 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
Stanford sports diehards present and
past have witnessed more than their
share of elite athletes. Nowadays, the
likes of Skov, Randle, Ogwumike and
Montgomery have become common
place names. There's Steffens and Ipsen,
Solomon and Rodgers... the list could go on for
some length. Viewing the world through Car
dinal-colored glasses, these Stanford athletics
"experts" are quite comfortable with their per

ceived vast expanse of knowledge.
But what if a claim were to arise that even
the most avid fan didn't know the name of the
individual who is possibly the most accom
plished athlete on campus? "Nonsense," would
be the retort. "I know everyonel"
Well, let's update the prescription, because
another Stanford superstar is about to come
squarely into focus. It's about time Cardinal
fans learned mountain-biking specialist Kate
Courtney's name she's faster on two wheels
than they'll likely ever be.

Freshman Kate Courtney, a mountain-biking
specialist from Marin County, Ca., has
amassed more race wins than she can count
on two hands - and then some.
It is understandable why
Courtney has flown under the
radar in her time on the Farm;
as a club-sport athlete, the
freshman's laundry list of vic
tories and awards don't re
ceive near the attention they
merit or that varsity and
NCAA-sanctioned sports
enjoy. Moreover, mountain
bikers a niche within a
niche aren't all that visible
to begin with and are followed
by a very select segment of
the sporting world. In fact, the
epicenter of that following is
quite close in the region of
Marin, just north of San Fran
cisco.

Perhaps unsurprisingly,
Courtney hails from northern
California and grew up riding
a tandem with her father,
Tom. Since Marin is arguably
the Mecca of mountain biking
worldwide, Courtney was im
mersed in mountain-biking
culture from an early age, but
it wasn't until midway
through high school that she
started to put serious time and
energy into the sport. A prom
ising distance runner during
her freshman and sophomore
years at The Branson School,
Courtney realized that "some
times, cross country is a little
bit of just suffering," and
turned the full force of her ef
forts to the bike.
The career that has fol
lowed is nothing short of re
markable: Courtney has won
more races than she can count
with two hands and then
some. The year 2013 was a
particularly incredible haul,
with her victories at the Pan-
Am Championships, Mont-
Sainte-Anne Junior World
Cup and USA Cycling's
Cross-Country Nationals.
And all of that was before she
swept the cross-country and
short track titles at the Colle
giate Mountain Biking Na
tionals in October. Shortly
thereafter, cycling industry
giant Specialized signed her to
their professional mountain
bike team.
While Courtney is certain

ly ready to jump to the next
level, moving up hasn't come
without its challenges.
"It's been a big challenge
this year for a lot of reasons,"
Courtney said of her transi
tion to the professional ranks.
"It's my first year starting col
lege, so I'm away from home. I
don't have my dad to work on
my bike every day and don't
have him to ride with every
day.
"I'm racing the best
women in the world," she
added. "I'm in the field with
them. And that's just an amaz
ing opportunity... just to get
to ride near them and start to
learn what it takes to compete
at that level."
Despite her new training
and living environments,
Courtney's success hasn't de
viated from its usual high
level. She recently placed
fourth in the Women U-23
Cross Country race at a UCI
World Cup event in Australia,
cementing her position as one
of the world's best young rid
ers. Yet even with her mount
ing successes, Courtney has
n't fallen into the trap of com
placency that snags many
young, high-achieving ath
letes.
"It's made me a more de
termined person, but recently,
more humble and more will
ing to work really, really
hard," said Courtney of how
success has impacted her.
"This year showed me that
this is really what I want to do,
and I have a long way to go.
That's very powerful."
If she truly is to reach the
pinnacle of her sport, Court
ney knows she must improve
her downhill technical skills.
In recent years, the designers
of mountain biking cross
country courses have added
more obstacles including
jumps, drop-offs and rock gar
dens â€” that have changed
many athletes' approaches to
training. For Courtney, some
times conquering the fear at
the top of a ledge is just as im
portant as cranking out the
training miles.
"[Obstacle-filled courses]
are not only hard to ride, but
it's hard to stand at the top of
that and say to yourself, 'Okay,
I'm going to jump off this

giant drop in front of a bunch
of people,'" she said. "That's
made it more challenging, but
also forced me to adapt and
train that way."
And training for Kate
Courtney is no simple joyride
across campus. Think going
uphill on Santa Theresa on a
windy day or biking all the
way from Stern to Hewlett is
difficult? Try the climb on Old
La Honda Road, which Court
ney says is one of her favorites
nearly three-and-a-half
miles of a grueling, when-is
this-going-to-stop, are-we
there-yet ascent of 1,290 feet
of vertical climbing with an av
erage gradient of 7.2 percent.
Sound hard? It certainly is,
but someway, somehow,
Courtney finds joy in the
crushing pain of oxygen debt
and lactic acid build-up. Her
Facebook profile picture has
her smiling triumphantly
alongside her bike at the top of
Montebello another local,
brutal climb with the cap
tion "My happy place." As she
explains, it's the relationships
that she's built with her train
ing partners that have
spurred her to forget suffer
ing on the way to the top.
"Those are definitely the
times I'm happiest: when I'm
with people I enjoy spending
time with and doing some
thing that I love and that
[they] also love," Courtney
said. "That's why I've been
able to train so hard this year
while doing school and why
I've been able to keep loving it
while I'm working hard and
doing intervals because
when I go out, I know it's what
I want to do."

And what Kate Courtney
wants to do is become one of
the best mountain bikers on
the planet a goal she's al
ready well on the way to ful
filling. In time, the wider
Stanford sports community
will come to appreciate her
accomplishments; they'll
soon adjust their Cardinal
tinted lenses and see her for
who she is: Stanford's next
budding superstar. That is, if
they can recognize the blur
as she whizzes by.

it wasn't until midway
through high school that she
started to put serious time and
energy into the sport. A prom
ising distance runner during
her freshman and sophomore
years at The Branson School,
Courtney realized that "some
times, cross country is a little
bit of just suffering," and
turned the full force of her ef
forts to the bike.
The career that has fol
lowed is nothing short of re
markable: Courtney has won
more races than she can count
with two hands and then
some. The year 2013 was a
particularly incredible haul,
with her victories at the Pan-
Am Championships, Mont-
Sainte-Anne Junior World
Cup and USA Cycling's
Cross-Country Nationals.
And all of that was before she
swept the cross-country and
short track titles at the Colle
giate Mountain Biking Na
tionals in October. Shortly
thereafter, cycling industry
giant Specialized signed her to
their professional mountain
bike team.
While Courtney is certain

ly ready to jump to the next
level, moving up hasn't come
without its challenges.
"It's been a big challenge
this year for a lot of reasons,"
Courtney said of her transi
tion to the professional ranks.
"It's my first year starting col
lege, so I'm away from home. I
don't have my dad to work on
my bike every day and don't
have him to ride with every
day.
"I'm racing the best
women in the world," she
added. "I'm in the field with
them. And that's just an amaz
ing opportunity... just to get
to ride near them and start to
learn what it takes to compete
at that level."
Despite her new training
and living environments,
Courtney's success hasn't de
viated from its usual high
level. She recently placed
fourth in the Women U-23
Cross Country race at a UCI
World Cup event in Australia,
cementing her position as one
of the world's best young rid
ers. Yet even with her mount
ing successes, Courtney has
n't fallen into the trap of com
placency that snags many
young, high-achieving ath
letes.
"It's made me a more de
termined person, but recently,
more humble and more will
ing to work really, really
hard," said Courtney of how
success has impacted her.
"This year showed me that
this is really what I want to do,
and I have a long way to go.
That's very powerful."
If she truly is to reach the
pinnacle of her sport, Court
ney knows she must improve
her downhill technical skills.
In recent years, the designers
of mountain biking cross
country courses have added
more obstacles including
jumps, drop-offs and rock gar
dens â€” that have changed
many athletes' approaches to
training. For Courtney, some
times conquering the fear at
the top of a ledge is just as im
portant as cranking out the
training miles.
"[Obstacle-filled courses]
are not only hard to ride, but
it's hard to stand at the top of
that and say to yourself, 'Okay,
I'm going to jump off this

giant drop in front of a bunch
of people,'" she said. "That's
made it more challenging, but
also forced me to adapt and
train that way."
And training for Kate
Courtney is no simple joyride
across campus. Think going
uphill on Santa Theresa on a
windy day or biking all the
way from Stern to Hewlett is
difficult? Try the climb on Old
La Honda Road, which Court
ney says is one of her favorites
nearly three-and-a-half
miles of a grueling, when-is
this-going-to-stop, are-we
there-yet ascent of 1,290 feet
of vertical climbing with an av
erage gradient of 7.2 percent.
Sound hard? It certainly is,
but someway, somehow,
Courtney finds joy in the
crushing pain of oxygen debt
and lactic acid build-up. Her
Facebook profile picture has
her smiling triumphantly
alongside her bike at the top of
Montebello another local,
brutal climb with the cap
tion "My happy place." As she
explains, it's the relationships
that she's built with her train
ing partners that have
spurred her to forget suffer
ing on the way to the top.
"Those are definitely the
times I'm happiest: when I'm
with people I enjoy spending
time with and doing some
thing that I love and that
[they] also love," Courtney
said. "That's why I've been
able to train so hard this year
while doing school and why
I've been able to keep loving it
while I'm working hard and
doing intervals because
when I go out, I know it's what
I want to do."

And what Kate Courtney
wants to do is become one of
the best mountain bikers on
the planet a goal she's al
ready well on the way to ful
filling. In time, the wider
Stanford sports community
will come to appreciate her
accomplishments; they'll
soon adjust their Cardinal
tinted lenses and see her for
who she is: Stanford's next
budding superstar. That is, if
they can recognize the blur
as she whizzes by.

Stanford sports diehards present and
past have witnessed more than their
share of elite athletes. Nowadays, the
likes of Skov, Randle, Ogwumike and
Montgomery have become common
place names. There's Steffens and Ipsen,
Solomon and Rodgers... the list could go on for
some length. Viewing the world through Car
dinal-colored glasses, these Stanford athletics
"experts" are quite comfortable with their per

ceived vast expanse of knowledge.
But what if a claim were to arise that even
the most avid fan didn't know the name of the
individual who is possibly the most accom
plished athlete on campus? "Nonsense," would
be the retort. "I know everyonel"
Well, let's update the prescription, because
another Stanford superstar is about to come
squarely into focus. It's about time Cardinal
fans learned mountain-biking specialist Kate
Courtney's name she's faster on two wheels
than they'll likely ever be.

Freshman Kate Courtney, a mountain-biking
specialist from Marin County, Ca., has
amassed more race wins than she can count
on two hands - and then some.
It is understandable why
Courtney has flown under the
radar in her time on the Farm;
as a club-sport athlete, the
freshman's laundry list of vic
tories and awards don't re
ceive near the attention they
merit or that varsity and
NCAA-sanctioned sports
enjoy. Moreover, mountain
bikers a niche within a
niche aren't all that visible
to begin with and are followed
by a very select segment of
the sporting world. In fact, the
epicenter of that following is
quite close in the region of
Marin, just north of San Fran
cisco.

Perhaps unsurprisingly,
Courtney hails from northern
California and grew up riding
a tandem with her father,
Tom. Since Marin is arguably
the Mecca of mountain biking
worldwide, Courtney was im
mersed in mountain-biking
culture from an early age, but
