## Rethinking quarterbacks' college choices 
### Nicholas Radoff 
Football is finally upon us; I
was beginning to think I
wouldn't make it. Sure, the
NBA Playoffs are as scin
tillating as they will ever be,
but I'll take the lonely island of football
in May to get me through until next
fan.

Nothing else rivals the sheer com
plexity and pageantry of the NFL
Draft —it's so exhilarating that it has
inspired its own Kevin Costner movie.
In fact, the draft is bigger than Kevin
Costner, which I guess means that it
can be pretty good sometimes, punctu
ated by periods of forced drama and
extensive monotony while occasionally
eliciting outright confusion. It can have
all the drama and poignancy of
"Dances with Wolves," truncated by
long periods of overproduction and
forced excitement, so ... "Water
world." Yet, despite all the exhilara
tion, tedium and Kevin Costner refer
ences, the real show often takes place
off-screen.
Take ourvery own Shayne Skov, or
(sorry) Michigan State's Max Bul
lough. I can give you very few reasons
why the two went undrafted, except to
say that Skov's injury continues to
(perplexingly) make teams nervous
and that Bullough's suspension and
speed deterred teams. And yet, every
year by the third pre-season game,
someone like them will have emerged
to be the next Vontaze Burfict and then
will be shocked when it happens. Bur
fict, by the way, was projected to be a
first-to-second-rounder at the start of
his last season.
The point being, the draft is like a
roulette wheel and an Ouija board
rolled into one; those responsible for
analyzing prospects shape perceptions
about the players as much as the play
ers leave impressions on scouts. That's
how a player can end the season as a
projected top-10 pick, get his wingspan
measured and lose $8 million in the
process. With this kind of uncertainty
when top players get spit out and un
knowns come shooting out of nowhere,
I can see the allure of the draft for
young players thinking about leaving
early Your number might just get
called if you can run just one good 40.
NFL scouts are scouring for talent,
sometimes taking the shine right off
the best prospects. It used to be that
you could spend four years at Ohio
State, Notre Dame or USC and know
for sure (and often hours in advance)
that your name would be called. Why
else would Brady Quinn bring his fam
ily to New York? But those were the
days when you could pay for college
without refinancing both kidneys it
just doesn't work like that anymore.
Remember when Matt Cassel was
drafted despite never having started a
game at USC? Do you really think
we'll ever see that again? The quarter
backs have it right: You won't get draft
ed unless you have at least two years of
starting experience. They know that if
they pop off the page, even if it's at a Di
vision II or 111 school, they have a bet
ter shot at getting drafted then if they
ride the pine at Alabama. (First rule of
the draft: Never take a running back in
the top five Second rule: Never take a
quarterback from Alabama.) The
myth of the big-name team has official
ly been busted, and it happened a
decade ago.
I get it; It's tough to say no when
Nick Saban himself appeal's to offer
you a scholarship to the most talented
roster in college football. But someone
needs to tell prospective college quar
terbacks that they are losing money
and not just a little, lest we forget Eric
Fisher of Central Michigan's $22 mil
lion payday. I don't care if I am the
best-looking prospect since Jadeveon
Clowney, I am staying the heck away
from Steve Sarkisian and Saban, who
might just sign you so someone else
can't, just because screw it —they
can.
Perhaps the most tragic thing
about it all is the purity behind the de
sire to play for the best. The athletes
sign on not just because they want to
be known as the best; instead, they do
it because of how badly they want to
win, and winning means a national
title.
I watched the national champi
onship game and I watched Jameis
Winston cement himself as a future
top-five pick. But I also watched the
draft, and the first quarterback to step
across that stage, Blake Bortles, would
have been shocked, no matter what
he'll tell you, to be playing for the title.
Look at the top five selected quarter
backs' schools: UCF, Texas A&M,
Louisville, Fresno State and Eastern
Illinois. That's one "powerhouse"
school in two rounds. If you want to
play at the next level, go showcase
your talent, because if you are on an
excellent team, every great play a
