## Rethinking quarterbacks' college choices 
### Nicholas Radoff 
Football is finally upon us; I
was beginning to think I
wouldn't make it. Sure, the
NBA Playoffs are as scin
tillating as they will ever be,
but I'll take the lonely island of football
in May to get me through until next
fan.

Nothing else rivals the sheer com
plexity and pageantry of the NFL
Draft —it's so exhilarating that it has
inspired its own Kevin Costner movie.
In fact, the draft is bigger than Kevin
Costner, which I guess means that it
can be pretty good sometimes, punctu
ated by periods of forced drama and
extensive monotony while occasionally
eliciting outright confusion. It can have
all the drama and poignancy of
"Dances with Wolves," truncated by
long periods of overproduction and
forced excitement, so ... "Water
world." Yet, despite all the exhilara
tion, tedium and Kevin Costner refer
ences, the real show often takes place
off-screen.
Take ourvery own Shayne Skov, or
(sorry) Michigan State's Max Bul
lough. I can give you very few reasons
why the two went undrafted, except to
say that Skov's injury continues to
(perplexingly) make teams nervous
and that Bullough's suspension and
speed deterred teams. And yet, every
year by the third pre-season game,
someone like them will have emerged
to be the next Vontaze Burfict and then
will be shocked when it happens. Bur
fict, by the way, was projected to be a
first-to-second-rounder at the start of
his last season.
The point being, the draft is like a
roulette wheel and an Ouija board
rolled into one; those responsible for
analyzing prospects shape perceptions
about the players as much as the play
ers leave impressions on scouts. That's
how a player can end the season as a
projected top-10 pick, get his wingspan
measured and lose $8 million in the
process. With this kind of uncertainty
when top players get spit out and un
knowns come shooting out of nowhere,
I can see the allure of the draft for
young players thinking about leaving
early Your number might just get
called if you can run just one good 40.
NFL scouts are scouring for talent,
sometimes taking the shine right off
the best prospects. It used to be that
you could spend four years at Ohio
State, Notre Dame or USC and know
for sure (and often hours in advance)
that your name would be called. Why
else would Brady Quinn bring his fam
ily to New York? But those were the
days when you could pay for college
without refinancing both kidneys it
just doesn't work like that anymore.
Remember when Matt Cassel was
drafted despite never having started a
game at USC? Do you really think
we'll ever see that again? The quarter
backs have it right: You won't get draft
ed unless you have at least two years of
starting experience. They know that if
they pop off the page, even if it's at a Di
vision II or 111 school, they have a bet
ter shot at getting drafted then if they
ride the pine at Alabama. (First rule of
the draft: Never take a running back in
the top five Second rule: Never take a
quarterback from Alabama.) The
myth of the big-name team has official
ly been busted, and it happened a
decade ago.
I get it; It's tough to say no when
Nick Saban himself appeal's to offer
you a scholarship to the most talented
roster in college football. But someone
needs to tell prospective college quar
terbacks that they are losing money
and not just a little, lest we forget Eric
Fisher of Central Michigan's $22 mil
lion payday. I don't care if I am the
best-looking prospect since Jadeveon
Clowney, I am staying the heck away
from Steve Sarkisian and Saban, who
might just sign you so someone else
can't, just because screw it —they
can.
Perhaps the most tragic thing
about it all is the purity behind the de
sire to play for the best. The athletes
sign on not just because they want to
be known as the best; instead, they do
it because of how badly they want to
win, and winning means a national
title.
I watched the national champi
onship game and I watched Jameis
Winston cement himself as a future
top-five pick. But I also watched the
draft, and the first quarterback to step
across that stage, Blake Bortles, would
have been shocked, no matter what
he'll tell you, to be playing for the title.
Look at the top five selected quarter
backs' schools: UCF, Texas A&M,
Louisville, Fresno State and Eastern
Illinois. That's one "powerhouse"
school in two rounds. If you want to
play at the next level, go showcase
your talent, because if you are on an
excellent team, every great play a
teammate makes is a great
play you don't get to make.
Scouts notice that, just like
how they will downplay your
talent based on the overall
talent of the team.
As the N CAA slowly atro
phies itself out of existence, I
think we are going to see
players start to follow the ex
ample of quarterbacks. It
doesn't matter if there isn't
an airstrip within 50 miles of
your school all you need is
a guy in the stands with a
phone and you can become an
NFL quarterback. Come
September, you will agoniz
ingly see high school football
on ESPN. If you can play
high school football in Des
Moines and get national at
tention, why does anyone
think they still need to go to
Tuscaloosa or Baton Rouge
just to put scouts on notice?
The answer is quite simple:
They don't, and doing so is a
poor financial decision.

The NFL has a rookie
symposium in which financial
responsibility is one of the
most prominent and impor
tant topics covered. Almost

no one is advising kids com
ing out of high school save
their parents and peers, most
of whom are vastly under
qualified to do so. Further
more, college coaches have
an incentive for taking a very
talented player and sitting
him or even cutting him, just
so another team cannot have
him.

Here, player unionization
might come in to help. If play
ers can seek financial gains,
there will be an impetus for
agents to start counseling
athletes right out of high
school an agent always
knows where the money is. I
understand that the morality
behind this movement is
questionable at best, but the
result cannot be debated:
The parity of teams will in
crease, talented athletes will
get to showcase them skills
and more young athletes will
get a chance to play at the
next level as well as maybe
even have a greater chance of
graduating.

Nicholas Radoff has already
started to plot out his path for
becoming the next mid
major quarterback to receive
a seven-figure payday out of
the NFL Draft. Send him.

needs to tell prospective college quar
terbacks that they are losing money
and not just a little, lest we forget Eric
Fisher of Central Michigan's $22 mil
lion payday. I don't care if I am the
best-looking prospect since Jadeveon
Clowney, I am staying the heck away
from Steve Sarkisian and Saban, who
might just sign you so someone else
can't, just because screw it —they
can.
Perhaps the most tragic thing
about it all is the purity behind the de
sire to play for the best. The athletes
sign on not just because they want to
be known as the best; instead, they do
it because of how badly they want to
win, and winning means a national
title.
I watched the national champi
onship game and I watched Jameis
Winston cement himself as a future
top-five pick. But I also watched the
draft, and the first quarterback to step
across that stage, Blake Bortles, would
have been shocked, no matter what
he'll tell you, to be playing for the title.
Look at the top five selected quarter
backs' schools: UCF, Texas A&M,
Louisville, Fresno State and Eastern
Illinois. That's one "powerhouse"
school in two rounds. If you want to
play at the next level, go showcase
your talent, because if you are on an
excellent team, every great play a
teammate makes is a great
play you don't get to make.
Scouts notice that, just like
how they will downplay your
talent based on the overall
talent of the team.
As the N CAA slowly atro
phies itself out of existence, I
think we are going to see
players start to follow the ex
ample of quarterbacks. It
doesn't matter if there isn't
an airstrip within 50 miles of
your school all you need is
a guy in the stands with a
phone and you can become an
NFL quarterback. Come
September, you will agoniz
ingly see high school football
on ESPN. If you can play
high school football in Des
Moines and get national at
tention, why does anyone
think they still need to go to
Tuscaloosa or Baton Rouge
just to put scouts on notice?
The answer is quite simple:
They don't, and doing so is a
poor financial decision.

The NFL has a rookie
symposium in which financial
responsibility is one of the
most prominent and impor
tant topics covered. Almost

no one is advising kids com
ing out of high school save
their parents and peers, most
of whom are vastly under
qualified to do so. Further
more, college coaches have
an incentive for taking a very
talented player and sitting
him or even cutting him, just
so another team cannot have
him.

Here, player unionization
might come in to help. If play
ers can seek financial gains,
there will be an impetus for
agents to start counseling
athletes right out of high
school an agent always
knows where the money is. I
understand that the morality
behind this movement is
questionable at best, but the
result cannot be debated:
The parity of teams will in
crease, talented athletes will
get to showcase them skills
and more young athletes will
get a chance to play at the
next level as well as maybe
even have a greater chance of
graduating.

Nicholas Radoff has already
started to plot out his path for
becoming the next mid
major quarterback to receive
a seven-figure payday out of
the NFL Draft. Send him.

Football is finally upon us; I
was beginning to think I
wouldn't make it. Sure, the
NBA Playoffs are as scin
tillating as they will ever be,
but I'll take the lonely island of football
in May to get me through until next
fan.

Nothing else rivals the sheer com
plexity and pageantry of the NFL
Draft —it's so exhilarating that it has
inspired its own Kevin Costner movie.
In fact, the draft is bigger than Kevin
Costner, which I guess means that it
can be pretty good sometimes, punctu
ated by periods of forced drama and
extensive monotony while occasionally
eliciting outright confusion. It can have
all the drama and poignancy of
"Dances with Wolves," truncated by
long periods of overproduction and
forced excitement, so ... "Water
world." Yet, despite all the exhilara
tion, tedium and Kevin Costner refer
ences, the real show often takes place
off-screen.
Take ourvery own Shayne Skov, or
(sorry) Michigan State's Max Bul
lough. I can give you very few reasons
why the two went undrafted, except to
say that Skov's injury continues to
(perplexingly) make teams nervous
and that Bullough's suspension and
speed deterred teams. And yet, every
year by the third pre-season game,
someone like them will have emerged
to be the next Vontaze Burfict and then
will be shocked when it happens. Bur
fict, by the way, was projected to be a
first-to-second-rounder at the start of
his last season.
The point being, the draft is like a
roulette wheel and an Ouija board
rolled into one; those responsible for
analyzing prospects shape perceptions
about the players as much as the play
ers leave impressions on scouts. That's
how a player can end the season as a
projected top-10 pick, get his wingspan
measured and lose $8 million in the
process. With this kind of uncertainty
when top players get spit out and un
knowns come shooting out of nowhere,
I can see the allure of the draft for
young players thinking about leaving
early Your number might just get
called if you can run just one good 40.
NFL scouts are scouring for talent,
sometimes taking the shine right off
the best prospects. It used to be that
you could spend four years at Ohio
State, Notre Dame or USC and know
for sure (and often hours in advance)
that your name would be called. Why
else would Brady Quinn bring his fam
ily to New York? But those were the
days when you could pay for college
without refinancing both kidneys it
just doesn't work like that anymore.
Remember when Matt Cassel was
drafted despite never having started a
game at USC? Do you really think
we'll ever see that again? The quarter
backs have it right: You won't get draft
ed unless you have at least two years of
starting experience. They know that if
they pop off the page, even if it's at a Di
vision II or 111 school, they have a bet
ter shot at getting drafted then if they
ride the pine at Alabama. (First rule of
the draft: Never take a running back in
the top five Second rule: Never take a
quarterback from Alabama.) The
myth of the big-name team has official
ly been busted, and it happened a
decade ago.
I get it; It's tough to say no when
Nick Saban himself appeal's to offer
you a scholarship to the most talented
roster in college football. But someone
needs to tell prospective college quar
terbacks that they are losing money
and not just a little, lest we forget Eric
