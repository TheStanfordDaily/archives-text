# SPARTAN STUNNER
## 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
The wheels fell off of Stanford
baseball's rally for the postseason
when the Cardinal shockingly
dropped a 10-8 contest to San Jose
State (18-36,10-20 Mountain West)
in a tough home defeat. Stanford
(24-22, 11-13 Pac-12) lost for the
first time this season when scoring
more than five runs and was served
its first midweek loss due to a poor
performance on the mound and two
costly errors that resulted in four
unearned runs.
San Jose State capitalized on
two big innings to pull off the im
probable comeback victory, scoring
four runs in the fourth and five runs
in the sixth. Despite entering the
contest 19 games below .500 and
with an RPI of 192, the Spartans'
offense picked up timely hits and
took advantage of seven walks and
three hit batsmen from Stanford's
pitching, as the Cardinal struggled
with control all night long.
"I think we gave them too much
we walked seven and hit three,"
said head coach Mark Marquess.
"We just gave them a lot of free
baserunners and they're a good hit

ting team. They had two big in
nings, which is the difference."
With a home loss against far
worse opposition (Stanford ranked
over 160 spots higher than San Jose
State in the RPI rankings) from a
weaker conference, Stanford's
postseason hopes suffered a major
blow. The Cardinal had won 13 of
their last 18 games to climb back
into the postseason picture and put
themselves right on the postseason
bubble. But according to Warren-
Nolan.com, Stanford dropped over
10 spots in RPI from the defeat,
from 31st to 42nd. The loss likely
forces Stanford to win out if it
wants a chance to make the post
season though that's not an im
possible task considering the oppo
nents they will face.
Stanford actually led 4-0
through three innings after a two
run home run from junior Alex
Blandino in the first inning, his Pac
-12-leading ninth homer of the year,
and an RBI single from sophomore
Brant Whiting in the third inning.
In the top of the fourth, however,
San Jose State chased freshman
starter Chris Viall from the game,
scoring four runs on four singles,
two walks and an error. Despite

making little hard contact, the
Spartans strung together several
bloopers into the outfield and chop
pers that just made it through the
infield to tie the game at four.
RBI singles from senior Danny
Diekroeger and Whiting in the
fourth and fifth innings, respective
ly, again handed Stanford its sec
ond lead of the game at 6-4. Whiting
continued his as-of-late impressive
performances at the plate, finish
ing 3-for-5 with three RBIs, and is
now hitting .459 over his last 11
games.
Disaster struck in the sixth in
ning for the Cardinal as they could
not escape the inning, allowing five
runs on four hits, two walks, two hit
batters and an error. Three differ
ent players pitched in the inning for
Stanford but none could find the
strike zone consistently until soph
omore Marcus Brakeman entered
to get the final out.
The shocked Cardinal attempt
ed a rally in the seventh inning,
scoring a run to close the gap to
only two runs at 9-7 after junior Do
minic Jose's sacrifice fly. A run in
the top of the ninth inning for San

Sophomore outfielder Zach Hoffpauir (above) went 3-for-4 with a double and two runs scored in Stanford's 10-8 loss to San Jose State on Tuesday
night. He is now hitting .567 (17-for-30) over his eight-game hitting streak and has raised his season triple-slash line to .327/.383/.478.

Jose State sucked the re
maining life out of the Cardi
nal, and after putting run
ners at first and third to start
the inning, a run-scoring
double play and a strikeout
officially ended the game in a
10-8 victory for the Spartans.
The script flipped on the
Cardinal, which had seen
their offense fail to support
their pitching several times
throughout the season (most
notably the seven times in
which Stanford scored zero
or one runs in a game) but
this time lost because the
pitching and defense couldn't
back up the hitting. Stanford
entered the game leading the
Pac-12 in fielding percentage
in conference games and
ranked 13th overall in the na
tion in that category but had
two throwing errors in the
infield.
"We made two errors
which really hurt us in the
two innings in which they
scored a lot of runs," Mar
quess said. "Sloppy defense
and giving them a lot of free
baserunners came back to
hurt us."
Still, the Cardinal have
scored 43 runs (6.1 runs per

game) over their past seven
games as the offense has
heated up from its inconsis
tent performance through
the first half of the season.
"We hit the ball well but
they only walked us twice,"
Marquess added. "We had
more hits but they didn't give
us a lot of free baserunners."
Both junior Austin Slater
and sophomore Zach Hoff
pauir recorded three hits as
they extended their hit
streaks to 10 and eight
games, respectively. Slater
has hit .500 (20-for-40) dur
ing that stretch while Hoff
pauir has also posted multi
ple hits in six straight games.
The team totaled 14 hits, out
hitting San Jose State, but
left runners in scoring posi
tion in the sixth and eighth
innings as the rally fell short.
The Cardinal have seven
games remaining this season
against Washington State,
Pacific and Utah and should
be favored to win in all of
their contests. The loss, how
ever, dramatically increases
the importance of Stanford
winning out.
Stanford hosts Washing
ton State at Sunken Dia
mond for a three-game series
starting this Friday at 7 p.m.
on Fireworks Night.
