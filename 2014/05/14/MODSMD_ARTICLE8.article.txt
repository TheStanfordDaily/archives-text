### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
The wheels fell off of Stanford
baseball's rally for the postseason
when the Cardinal shockingly
dropped a 10-8 contest to San Jose
State (18-36,10-20 Mountain West)
in a tough home defeat. Stanford
(24-22, 11-13 Pac-12) lost for the
first time this season when scoring
more than five runs and was served
its first midweek loss due to a poor
performance on the mound and two
costly errors that resulted in four
unearned runs.
San Jose State capitalized on
two big innings to pull off the im
probable comeback victory, scoring
four runs in the fourth and five runs
in the sixth. Despite entering the
contest 19 games below .500 and
with an RPI of 192, the Spartans'
offense picked up timely hits and
took advantage of seven walks and
three hit batsmen from Stanford's
pitching, as the Cardinal struggled
with control all night long.
"I think we gave them too much
we walked seven and hit three,"
said head coach Mark Marquess.
"We just gave them a lot of free
baserunners and they're a good hit

ting team. They had two big in
nings, which is the difference."
With a home loss against far
worse opposition (Stanford ranked
over 160 spots higher than San Jose
State in the RPI rankings) from a
weaker conference, Stanford's
postseason hopes suffered a major
blow. The Cardinal had won 13 of
their last 18 games to climb back
into the postseason picture and put
themselves right on the postseason
bubble. But according to Warren-
Nolan.com, Stanford dropped over
10 spots in RPI from the defeat,
from 31st to 42nd. The loss likely
forces Stanford to win out if it
wants a chance to make the post
season though that's not an im
possible task considering the oppo
nents they will face.
Stanford actually led 4-0
through three innings after a two
run home run from junior Alex
Blandino in the first inning, his Pac
-12-leading ninth homer of the year,
and an RBI single from sophomore
Brant Whiting in the third inning.
In the top of the fourth, however,
San Jose State chased freshman
starter Chris Viall from the game,
scoring four runs on four singles,
two walks and an error. Despite

making little hard contact, the
Spartans strung together several
bloopers into the outfield and chop
pers that just made it through the
infield to tie the game at four.
RBI singles from senior Danny
Diekroeger and Whiting in the
fourth and fifth innings, respective
ly, again handed Stanford its sec
ond lead of the game at 6-4. Whiting
continued his as-of-late impressive
performances at the plate, finish
ing 3-for-5 with three RBIs, and is
now hitting .459 over his last 11
games.
Disaster struck in the sixth in
ning for the Cardinal as they could
not escape the inning, allowing five
runs on four hits, two walks, two hit
batters and an error. Three differ
ent players pitched in the inning for
Stanford but none could find the
strike zone consistently until soph
omore Marcus Brakeman entered
to get the final out.
The shocked Cardinal attempt
ed a rally in the seventh inning,
scoring a run to close the gap to
only two runs at 9-7 after junior Do
minic Jose's sacrifice fly. A run in
the top of the ninth inning for San
