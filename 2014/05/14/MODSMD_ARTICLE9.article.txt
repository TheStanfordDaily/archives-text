# WEDNESDAY ROUNDTABLE
## Diagnosing the NFL Draft 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
In this past weekend's NFL
Draft, many people were sur
prised when guard David
Yankey dropped to the fifth
round, but even more were
stunned when inside line
backer Shayne Skov went un
drafted and ultimately ended
up signing as an undrafted
free agent with the San Fran
cisco U9ers. In the wake of those
proceedings, we asked football
writers Michael Peterson,
Vihan Lakshman and David
Cohn: Why did Stanford's
players fall so low?
Michael: The common theme
for Yankey and Skov and even
Tyler Gaffney, who suffered a little
bit of a fall of his own in regards to
the NFL Draft was questions
about athleticism.
With Yankey, scouts worried
that he wasn't strong enough or
quick enough to be able to consis
tently deal with NFL-caliber defen
sive linemen. For Skov, NFL teams
still wondered whether or not his
ACL/MCL injuries have had linger
ing effects on his speed and explo
siveness. And for Gaffney, even after
posting a 4.46 40-yard dash time,
ESPN analyst Bill Polian said that
Gaffney doesn't have "big speed,"
echoing a sentiment seemingly felt
by all the teams who passed over
Gaffney in the fifth and sixth rounds.
On the other hand, Trent Mur
phy, Cameron Fleming and Ben
Gardner, the three Stanford play
ers who were drafted around when
they were projected to go, per
formed rather well in traditional

combine and pro day tests that
scouts use to evaluate players
Murphy and Fleming impressing
with then 1 strength and Gardner
with his overall athleticism.

While the concerns barring the
former trio don't seem completely
valid in my opinion, they were
enough for teams to question
whether Yankey or Skov could live
up to their billing. The consequence,
if anything, is to put a chip on the
shoulders of Yankey and Skov, which
I fully expect to see them each use to
their advantage in their futures in
the NFL.

Vihan: I think Michael hit the
nail on the head: NFL scouts
seemed to rely heavily on raw mea
surables in this draft and several
Stanford players did not post the
numbers they were expected to.
As evidence, consider the example
of Gardner, one of the positive
Stanford stories from the week
end. Although initially projected
to go undrafted after tearing his
pectoral muscle midseason, Gard
ner wowed NFL teams in his only
pre-draft workout at Stanford's
pro day posting a 39.5-inch ver
tical leap, the highest out of any
participant. Afterwards, Gard
ner's draft stock shot up consider
ably, ultimately leading to a sev
enth-round selection.
On the other hand, Skov was re
portedly hampered by a hamstring
injury all throughout the pre-draft
process and did not run at the NFL
Combine. Add in the lingering knee
concerns, and teams seemed will
ing to look past the fact that he's the
leading tackier on one of the top de
fenses in the country.
The same appears true for

Yankey, a two-time Ail-American
and undisputed leader of one of the
best offensive lines in the country.
His perceived slow footwork and
lack of athleticism seem to have
carried more weight with scouts
than his on-field production.
Another possible reason for the
falling draft stock of so many Stan
ford prospects could be a residual
effect of the Jonathan Martin inci
dent in Miami this past season. Al
though this is pure speculation, it
is not inconceivable that some

NFL front offices felt trepidation
about drafting a Stanford player
and were perhaps worried that
Cardinal prospects could not han
dle the culture of the NFL.
Nonetheless, the draft does not
necessarily seal a player's fate and
almost all Stanford prospects have
been given a chance to compete
and earn a spot on an NFL roster
an opportunity they will surely
look to maximize.

Fifth-year senior inside linebacker Shayne Skov (above) went undrafted
in the 2014 NFL Draft, but ended up signing with the San Francisco
49ers, reuniting with former Stanford head coach Jim Harbaugh.
David: I agree with
Michael and Vihan in that
several factors certainly con
tributed to this phenomenon.
I certainly believe that some
general managers and NFL
executives attached the "sys
tem" label to players such as
Gaffney and Skov; more
specifically, these NFL offi
cials could have attributed
some of Gaffney's and Skov's
success to the effectiveness of
Stanford's system and
schemes rather than either
player's raw ability. As such,
it is clear that general man
agers value height, weight,
speed and other athletic met
rics as better indicators of po
tential at the next level than
production in college.
Skov certainly was also

not helped by the fact that he
missed the combine due to in
jury, and that his 5.1-second
40-time came while he was
still dealing with the linger
ing effects of his calf injury.
Finally, I think this example
provides ample evidence that
while ESPN, CBS.com or
even NFL.com analysts may
try their best to predict the
results of the upcoming
draft, sometimes it is impos
sible to predict what NFL
executives will ultimately de
cide to do.

Despite the disappointments
of having many Cardinal
players fall below their pro
jections, Michael Peterson,
Vihan Lakshman and Dcwid
Cohn are even more surprised
that the Stanford Tree remains
an undrafted free agent. Tell
them to apply to be the Tree's
agent at mrpeters@Stanford,

injury all throughout the pre-draft
process and did not run at the NFL
Combine. Add in the lingering knee
concerns, and teams seemed will
ing to look past the fact that he's the
leading tackier on one of the top de
fenses in the country.
The same appears true for

Yankey, a two-time Ail-American
and undisputed leader of one of the
best offensive lines in the country.
His perceived slow footwork and
lack of athleticism seem to have
carried more weight with scouts
than his on-field production.
Another possible reason for the
falling draft stock of so many Stan
ford prospects could be a residual
effect of the Jonathan Martin inci
dent in Miami this past season. Al
though this is pure speculation, it
is not inconceivable that some

NFL front offices felt trepidation
about drafting a Stanford player
and were perhaps worried that
Cardinal prospects could not han
dle the culture of the NFL.
Nonetheless, the draft does not
necessarily seal a player's fate and
almost all Stanford prospects have
been given a chance to compete
and earn a spot on an NFL roster
an opportunity they will surely
look to maximize.

Fifth-year senior inside linebacker Shayne Skov (above) went undrafted
in the 2014 NFL Draft, but ended up signing with the San Francisco
49ers, reuniting with former Stanford head coach Jim Harbaugh.
David: I agree with
Michael and Vihan in that
several factors certainly con
tributed to this phenomenon.
I certainly believe that some
general managers and NFL
executives attached the "sys
tem" label to players such as
Gaffney and Skov; more
specifically, these NFL offi
cials could have attributed
some of Gaffney's and Skov's
success to the effectiveness of
Stanford's system and
schemes rather than either
player's raw ability. As such,
it is clear that general man
agers value height, weight,
speed and other athletic met
rics as better indicators of po
tential at the next level than
production in college.
Skov certainly was also

not helped by the fact that he
missed the combine due to in
jury, and that his 5.1-second
40-time came while he was
still dealing with the linger
ing effects of his calf injury.
Finally, I think this example
provides ample evidence that
while ESPN, CBS.com or
even NFL.com analysts may
try their best to predict the
results of the upcoming
draft, sometimes it is impos
sible to predict what NFL
executives will ultimately de
cide to do.

Despite the disappointments
of having many Cardinal
players fall below their pro
jections, Michael Peterson,
Vihan Lakshman and Dcwid
Cohn are even more surprised
that the Stanford Tree remains
an undrafted free agent. Tell
them to apply to be the Tree's
agent at mrpeters@Stanford,
edu, iihan@stanford.edu and

In this past weekend's NFL
Draft, many people were sur
prised when guard David
Yankey dropped to the fifth
round, but even more were
stunned when inside line
backer Shayne Skov went un
drafted and ultimately ended
up signing as an undrafted
free agent with the San Fran
cisco U9ers. In the wake of those
proceedings, we asked football
writers Michael Peterson,
Vihan Lakshman and David
Cohn: Why did Stanford's
players fall so low?
Michael: The common theme
for Yankey and Skov and even
Tyler Gaffney, who suffered a little
bit of a fall of his own in regards to
the NFL Draft was questions
about athleticism.
With Yankey, scouts worried
that he wasn't strong enough or
quick enough to be able to consis
tently deal with NFL-caliber defen
sive linemen. For Skov, NFL teams
still wondered whether or not his
ACL/MCL injuries have had linger
ing effects on his speed and explo
siveness. And for Gaffney, even after
posting a 4.46 40-yard dash time,
ESPN analyst Bill Polian said that
Gaffney doesn't have "big speed,"
echoing a sentiment seemingly felt
by all the teams who passed over
Gaffney in the fifth and sixth rounds.
On the other hand, Trent Mur
phy, Cameron Fleming and Ben
Gardner, the three Stanford play
ers who were drafted around when
they were projected to go, per
formed rather well in traditional

combine and pro day tests that
scouts use to evaluate players
Murphy and Fleming impressing
with then 1 strength and Gardner
with his overall athleticism.

While the concerns barring the
former trio don't seem completely
valid in my opinion, they were
enough for teams to question
whether Yankey or Skov could live
up to their billing. The consequence,
if anything, is to put a chip on the
shoulders of Yankey and Skov, which
I fully expect to see them each use to
their advantage in their futures in
the NFL.

Vihan: I think Michael hit the
nail on the head: NFL scouts
seemed to rely heavily on raw mea
surables in this draft and several
Stanford players did not post the
numbers they were expected to.
As evidence, consider the example
of Gardner, one of the positive
Stanford stories from the week
end. Although initially projected
to go undrafted after tearing his
pectoral muscle midseason, Gard
ner wowed NFL teams in his only
pre-draft workout at Stanford's
pro day posting a 39.5-inch ver
tical leap, the highest out of any
participant. Afterwards, Gard
ner's draft stock shot up consider
ably, ultimately leading to a sev
enth-round selection.
On the other hand, Skov was re
portedly hampered by a hamstring
injury all throughout the pre-draft
process and did not run at the NFL
Combine. Add in the lingering knee
concerns, and teams seemed will
ing to look past the fact that he's the
