# Q&A BRETT MICHAEL DORAN
## Senior talks baseball, his nickame and life after Stanford 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
In the third 2013-14 edition
of "Senior Sit Do wn," The
Daily's Michael Peterson chat
ted with baseball senior Brett
Michael Doran.
Michael Peterson (MP): First
off, does it feel real to you that
you're a senior with just about a
month left here on the Farm?
Brett Michael Doran (BMD):
It's weird. It went by fast and
thinking about it, we have eight
games left in the season and only
eight games left in my collegiate ca
reer. It's definitely a weird thing
and it's hard to get a grasp of that.
MP: What is it like being an
everyday starter on the team this
year?
BMD: It's been awesome. My
first three years, I got some playing
time but mostly pinch hit here, had
a spot start here and there so
getting to play every day has been
awesome. It's been a lot of fun. I en
joyed my time even when I wasn't
getting to play as much, still getting
to be around the guys. But being on
the field makes it that much better.
MP: On a different topic, obvi
ously Milford, Connecticut is a
pretty long way from Stanford. Has
it been difficult or been much of a
culture shock moving out here?
BMD: It's definitely different
out here in Northern California
than it is back home. But I've en
joyed it and I actually have some
family out here, so that's made the
transition a little easier. My dad has
made every series this season, trav
eling across the country, and my
mom has made it for a ton of series
as well. It's nice having my parents
around. And the weather here is re
ally nice. This winter was tough
back home, there was a lot of snow,
and I was out here enjoying the
sun, so that's definitely a nice
change.

MP: What does it mean to you
that your parents travel out here to
see all your games?

BMD: It's awesome. It's nice to

just have them there. I think they
really enjoy getting to see me play.
They're really close with a lot of
parents on the team, so they've
kind of enjoyed their four years
with the team as well.

MP: So are you a West Coast or
an East Coast guy now?
BMD: Still an East Coast guy.
I've definitely warmed up to the
West Coast in some ways and I like
it out here. I really do. But I'm still
an East Coast guy at heart.
MP: For the past four years
you've been able to play with a
number of other guys like Danny
Diekroeger, Brant Whiting, Sam
Lindquist and AJ Vanegas. What's
it been like to play with this senior
class for all four years?
BMD: It's been great; I think
this year's team is the team with
the most seniors since I've been
here. Usually, you have a lot of guys

who leave for the draft after their
junior years, but for whatever rea
sons, guys didn't leave last year. So
we've had this core group of seniors
now, and having that presence this
year has really been a positive
thing. Just having that senior lead
ership and the calmness, since
we've kind of been through it be
fore, has been helpful for the team
and has made my senior year better
too.
MP: What would you say are
some of your favorite memories
from your time here?
BMD: Favorite memories...
Definitely making it to Super Re
gionals. That was just a cool experi
ence, that whole thing. One win that
stands out was I think my freshman
year We had a come-from-behind
win against UCLA [Stanford

scored four runs with two
outs in the ninth to win]. I
don't remember the exact sit
uation, but it was a big come
back win in the ninth to get a
big series win. For whatever
reason, that win stands out as
being a pretty cool experi
ence. I had a couple of good
moments personally. I was
able to have a couple walk-off
hits. Those were cool. But
mainly the postseason
games, those were really fun
to be a part of.
MP: And what about off
the field and just on campus?
BMD: The thing I'm
going to miss most about
being here baseball-wise
the playing, obviously I'm
going to miss baseball but
it's just being with the guys
every day. We spend so much
time together. We've had
some long practices where
you just get close with one an
other. It's not necessarily one
story that stands out, but it's
the everyday interaction and
the relationships I've been
able to build that I'll have for
ever.
MP: So I know your nick
name is "B-Mike." How did
that come about?
BMD: My dad's name is
Brett and he did not want
Brett Jr. and Brett Sr., so I've
always gone by Brett
Michael. Michael's my middle
name. People were okay with
that, but Brett Michael's a lit
tle long. So eventually, I for
get, but someone who was not
happy with saying Brett
Michael was like, "How about

'B-Mike?'" And I was like,
"You know what, that works.
It's a lot shorter and a lot eas
ier." That happened some
time in high school and it's
stuck ever since.
MP: I know you said you
graduated last quarter. What
was your degree in again?
BMD: Management Sci
ence and Engineering.
MP: What are your plans
for when baseball season
ends in about a month?
BMD: I have a job set up
that I've accepted in Min
nesota, so that's big change as
far as location. My dream is to
still keep playing baseball,
but I'm not exactly sure if
that's going to work out as
planned. I'm excited for this
job I think it's a good op
portunity and I'm interested
to see how Minnesota is.

MP: If you did hear your
name called in the MLB
draft, would you immediately
go for that?
BMD: Absolutely.
MP: That would be awe
some. If you do go to Min
nesota you would go from the
East to the West to the North
all kinds of weather. How
did you figure out that you
were going to go to Minneso
ta?
BMD: There's a company
that I'm definitely interested
in working for and it owns a
number of companies
throughout the country. I
wanted to do a certain pro
gram for the bigger company,
and I was interviewing for
that. They said there was an
opening in Minnesota and at
first I said, "Ah, I don't
know." But I went (to visit)

and when I received the offer,
I realized that it was proba
bly my best opportunity. I
was like, "All right, I guess
Minnesota is where I'll work
after the season."
MP: What company is it?
BMD: The bigger compa
ny is called Danaher, and the
specific company they placed
me in is called Beckman
Coulter.
MP: Cool. Is there any
thing you want to do before
you leave for that?
BMD: I'm just trying to
enjoy every day out here.
Playing baseball without hav
ing classes is pretty much the
dream for me. I'm just enjoy
ing it, trying to take in every
day I have on campus.

Doran (left), a Management Science and Engineering major, is known by teammates as "B-Mike,"
a nickname he picked up in his youth as a shortening of his first and middle names.
In the third 2013-14 edition
of "Senior Sit Do wn," The
Daily's Michael Peterson chat
ted with baseball senior Brett
Michael Doran.
Michael Peterson (MP): First
off, does it feel real to you that
you're a senior with just about a
month left here on the Farm?
Brett Michael Doran (BMD):
It's weird. It went by fast and
thinking about it, we have eight
games left in the season and only
eight games left in my collegiate ca
reer. It's definitely a weird thing
and it's hard to get a grasp of that.
MP: What is it like being an
everyday starter on the team this
year?
BMD: It's been awesome. My
first three years, I got some playing
time but mostly pinch hit here, had
a spot start here and there so
getting to play every day has been
awesome. It's been a lot of fun. I en
joyed my time even when I wasn't
getting to play as much, still getting
to be around the guys. But being on
the field makes it that much better.
MP: On a different topic, obvi
ously Milford, Connecticut is a
pretty long way from Stanford. Has
it been difficult or been much of a
culture shock moving out here?
BMD: It's definitely different
out here in Northern California
than it is back home. But I've en
joyed it and I actually have some
family out here, so that's made the
transition a little easier. My dad has
made every series this season, trav
eling across the country, and my
mom has made it for a ton of series
as well. It's nice having my parents
around. And the weather here is re
ally nice. This winter was tough
back home, there was a lot of snow,
and I was out here enjoying the
sun, so that's definitely a nice
change.

MP: What does it mean to you
that your parents travel out here to
see all your games?

BMD: It's awesome. It's nice to

just have them there. I think they
really enjoy getting to see me play.
They're really close with a lot of
parents on the team, so they've
kind of enjoyed their four years
with the team as well.

MP: So are you a West Coast or
an East Coast guy now?
BMD: Still an East Coast guy.
I've definitely warmed up to the
West Coast in some ways and I like
it out here. I really do. But I'm still
an East Coast guy at heart.
MP: For the past four years
you've been able to play with a
number of other guys like Danny
Diekroeger, Brant Whiting, Sam
Lindquist and AJ Vanegas. What's
it been like to play with this senior
class for all four years?
BMD: It's been great; I think
this year's team is the team with
the most seniors since I've been
here. Usually, you have a lot of guys

who leave for the draft after their
junior years, but for whatever rea
sons, guys didn't leave last year. So
we've had this core group of seniors
now, and having that presence this
year has really been a positive
thing. Just having that senior lead
ership and the calmness, since
we've kind of been through it be
fore, has been helpful for the team
and has made my senior year better
too.
MP: What would you say are
some of your favorite memories
from your time here?
BMD: Favorite memories...
Definitely making it to Super Re
gionals. That was just a cool experi
ence, that whole thing. One win that
stands out was I think my freshman
year We had a come-from-behind
win against UCLA [Stanford


BOB DREBIN/stanfordphoto.com

scored four runs with two
outs in the ninth to win]. I
don't remember the exact sit
uation, but it was a big come
back win in the ninth to get a
big series win. For whatever
reason, that win stands out as
being a pretty cool experi
ence. I had a couple of good
moments personally. I was
able to have a couple walk-off
hits. Those were cool. But
mainly the postseason
games, those were really fun
to be a part of.
MP: And what about off
the field and just on campus?
BMD: The thing I'm
going to miss most about
being here baseball-wise
the playing, obviously I'm
going to miss baseball but
it's just being with the guys
every day. We spend so much
time together. We've had
some long practices where
you just get close with one an
other. It's not necessarily one
story that stands out, but it's
the everyday interaction and
the relationships I've been
able to build that I'll have for
ever.
MP: So I know your nick
name is "B-Mike." How did
that come about?
BMD: My dad's name is
Brett and he did not want
Brett Jr. and Brett Sr., so I've
always gone by Brett
Michael. Michael's my middle
name. People were okay with
that, but Brett Michael's a lit
tle long. So eventually, I for
get, but someone who was not
happy with saying Brett
Michael was like, "How about

'B-Mike?'" And I was like,
"You know what, that works.
It's a lot shorter and a lot eas
ier." That happened some
time in high school and it's
stuck ever since.
MP: I know you said you
graduated last quarter. What
was your degree in again?
BMD: Management Sci
ence and Engineering.
MP: What are your plans
for when baseball season
ends in about a month?
BMD: I have a job set up
that I've accepted in Min
nesota, so that's big change as
far as location. My dream is to
still keep playing baseball,
but I'm not exactly sure if
that's going to work out as
planned. I'm excited for this
job I think it's a good op
portunity and I'm interested
to see how Minnesota is.

MP: If you did hear your
name called in the MLB
draft, would you immediately
go for that?
BMD: Absolutely.
MP: That would be awe
some. If you do go to Min
nesota you would go from the
East to the West to the North
all kinds of weather. How
did you figure out that you
were going to go to Minneso
ta?
BMD: There's a company
that I'm definitely interested
in working for and it owns a
number of companies
throughout the country. I
wanted to do a certain pro
gram for the bigger company,
and I was interviewing for
that. They said there was an
opening in Minnesota and at

MP: I know you said you
graduated last quarter. What
was your degree in again?
BMD: Management Sci
ence and Engineering.
MP: What are your plans
for when baseball season
ends in about a month?
BMD: I have a job set up
that I've accepted in Min
nesota, so that's big change as
far as location. My dream is to
still keep playing baseball,
but I'm not exactly sure if
that's going to work out as
planned. I'm excited for this
job I think it's a good op
portunity and I'm interested
to see how Minnesota is.

MP: If you did hear your
name called in the MLB
draft, would you immediately
go for that?
BMD: Absolutely.
MP: That would be awe
some. If you do go to Min
nesota you would go from the
East to the West to the North
all kinds of weather. How
did you figure out that you
were going to go to Minneso
ta?
BMD: There's a company
that I'm definitely interested
in working for and it owns a
number of companies
throughout the country. I
wanted to do a certain pro
gram for the bigger company,
and I was interviewing for
that. They said there was an
opening in Minnesota and at
first I said, "Ah, I don't
know." But I went (to visit)

and when I received the offer,
I realized that it was proba
bly my best opportunity. I
was like, "All right, I guess
Minnesota is where I'll work
after the season."
MP: What company is it?
BMD: The bigger compa
ny is called Danaher, and the
specific company they placed
me in is called Beckman
Coulter.
MP: Cool. Is there any
thing you want to do before
you leave for that?
BMD: I'm just trying to
enjoy every day out here.
Playing baseball without hav
ing classes is pretty much the
dream for me. I'm just enjoy
ing it, trying to take in every
day I have on campus.
