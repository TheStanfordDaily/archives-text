# Q&A BRETT MICHAEL DORAN
## Senior talks baseball, his nickame and life after Stanford 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
In the third 2013-14 edition
of "Senior Sit Do wn," The
Daily's Michael Peterson chat
ted with baseball senior Brett
Michael Doran.
Michael Peterson (MP): First
off, does it feel real to you that
you're a senior with just about a
month left here on the Farm?
Brett Michael Doran (BMD):
It's weird. It went by fast and
thinking about it, we have eight
games left in the season and only
eight games left in my collegiate ca
reer. It's definitely a weird thing
and it's hard to get a grasp of that.
MP: What is it like being an
everyday starter on the team this
year?
BMD: It's been awesome. My
first three years, I got some playing
time but mostly pinch hit here, had
a spot start here and there so
getting to play every day has been
awesome. It's been a lot of fun. I en
joyed my time even when I wasn't
getting to play as much, still getting
to be around the guys. But being on
the field makes it that much better.
MP: On a different topic, obvi
ously Milford, Connecticut is a
pretty long way from Stanford. Has
it been difficult or been much of a
culture shock moving out here?
BMD: It's definitely different
out here in Northern California
than it is back home. But I've en
joyed it and I actually have some
family out here, so that's made the
transition a little easier. My dad has
made every series this season, trav
eling across the country, and my
mom has made it for a ton of series
as well. It's nice having my parents
around. And the weather here is re
ally nice. This winter was tough
back home, there was a lot of snow,
and I was out here enjoying the
sun, so that's definitely a nice
change.

MP: What does it mean to you
that your parents travel out here to
see all your games?

BMD: It's awesome. It's nice to

just have them there. I think they
really enjoy getting to see me play.
They're really close with a lot of
parents on the team, so they've
kind of enjoyed their four years
with the team as well.

MP: So are you a West Coast or
an East Coast guy now?
BMD: Still an East Coast guy.
I've definitely warmed up to the
West Coast in some ways and I like
it out here. I really do. But I'm still
an East Coast guy at heart.
MP: For the past four years
you've been able to play with a
number of other guys like Danny
Diekroeger, Brant Whiting, Sam
Lindquist and AJ Vanegas. What's
it been like to play with this senior
class for all four years?
BMD: It's been great; I think
this year's team is the team with
the most seniors since I've been
here. Usually, you have a lot of guys

who leave for the draft after their
junior years, but for whatever rea
sons, guys didn't leave last year. So
we've had this core group of seniors
now, and having that presence this
year has really been a positive
thing. Just having that senior lead
ership and the calmness, since
we've kind of been through it be
fore, has been helpful for the team
and has made my senior year better
too.
MP: What would you say are
some of your favorite memories
from your time here?
BMD: Favorite memories...
Definitely making it to Super Re
gionals. That was just a cool experi
ence, that whole thing. One win that
stands out was I think my freshman
year We had a come-from-behind
win against UCLA [Stanford
