## US Men's National Soccer Team arrives at Stanford 
### – Cameron Miller 
The United States Men's Na
tional Soccer Team began its train
ing camp at Stanford Stadium on
Wednesday in preparation for this
summer's World Cup. The team will
also use Laird Q. Cagan Stadium
for its practices, which are set to
continue on campus through May
25th.

USMNT coach Jurgen Klins
mann has invited 30 players to the

Farm 21 were in attendance
today but only 23 will make the
final squad that will head to Brazil.
Consensus among soccer experts is
that perhaps a half-dozen players
are locks to make the squad; thus,
the Stanford training camp figures
to be a critical period for Klinsmann
and his coaches as they whittle
down the roster.

Shortly after the unit wraps up
its stay at Stanford, it will play
Azerbaijan at Candlestick Park in
the first of three international
friendly matches it has scheduled

before the World Cup. Turkey is
next on June 1; after the match,
Klinsmann will cut seven players
and finalize the group that will trav
el to Brazil. After taking on Nigeria
in its final tune-up on June 7, the
USMNT will head south to confront
the so-called "Group of Death".
Ghana the country that has
ousted the US from the last two
World Cups—will be up first for
the Americans. Klinsmann's crew
will then face juggernauts and top-
three FIFA-ranked teams
Portugal and Germany. The
tilt with the Germans figures
to be particularly emotional
for a few reasons: The US
squad could be fighting to
stay in the tournament, while
Klinsmann will be facing the
squad he used to play for and
coach.
