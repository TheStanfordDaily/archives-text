## Erasing the errors of 2013 Eugene brings a shot for revenge 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
Looking to break through the
huge disappointment it suffered
at last year's regional and move
one step closer to their ultimate
goal of a national championship,
the Stanford men's golf team will
hit the Eugene Country Club
course today at the NCAA West
Regional. The Cardinal enter the
event as the regional's top seed,
with the hopes of keeping their
momentum rolling after winning
the Pac-12 Championship in dom
inating fashion a few weeks ago.
"We're excited about the
event," said Stanford head coach
Conrad Ray. "It's a traditional old
course that requires a lot of shot
making. It's not super long, but
there's a high premium for balls
in the fairway and controlling
your golf ball on the greens and
keeping the ball below the hole."
Not only will the layout in Eu
gene require some technical nav
igating, but the Card are also fac
ing a solid but manageable field.
The 13-team regional includes
No. 10 Houston, No. 15 Oklaho
ma and No. 22 South Carolina,
plus the Big South Conference
champion in Liberty. In order to
advance to the NCAA Champi
onships in Hutchinson, Kansas,
Stanford will need to finish in the
top five at the regional a for
gone conclusion to some when
considering the Cardinal's lofty
No. 3 ranking. But the squad re
alizes that despite its recent suc
cesses, nothing can be taken for
granted.
Still, Ray's group has per
formed well against the teams
they will face at the regional in its
tournament play this season.
Stanford is 4-0 versus Oklahoma
and Baylor in tournaments over
the fall and spring seasons, and
has only one loss to all teams in
the field over the entire year
to regional host Oregon at Febru
ary's Amer Ari Invitational. The
Ducks finished just two strokes in
front of the Card at the event.
Since the squad's trip to Hawaii,
it has won four of their five starts
and has seen every part of their
lineup blossom.
Veterans Patrick Rodgers and
Cameron Wilson continue to lead
Stanford at the front; Rodgers
still sits atop the World Amateur
