## Erasing the errors of 2013 Eugene brings a shot for revenge 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
Looking to break through the
huge disappointment it suffered
at last year's regional and move
one step closer to their ultimate
goal of a national championship,
the Stanford men's golf team will
hit the Eugene Country Club
course today at the NCAA West
Regional. The Cardinal enter the
event as the regional's top seed,
with the hopes of keeping their
momentum rolling after winning
the Pac-12 Championship in dom
inating fashion a few weeks ago.
"We're excited about the
event," said Stanford head coach
Conrad Ray. "It's a traditional old
course that requires a lot of shot
making. It's not super long, but
there's a high premium for balls
in the fairway and controlling
your golf ball on the greens and
keeping the ball below the hole."
Not only will the layout in Eu
gene require some technical nav
igating, but the Card are also fac
ing a solid but manageable field.
The 13-team regional includes
No. 10 Houston, No. 15 Oklaho
ma and No. 22 South Carolina,
plus the Big South Conference
champion in Liberty. In order to
advance to the NCAA Champi
onships in Hutchinson, Kansas,
Stanford will need to finish in the
top five at the regional a for
gone conclusion to some when
considering the Cardinal's lofty
No. 3 ranking. But the squad re
alizes that despite its recent suc
cesses, nothing can be taken for
granted.
Still, Ray's group has per
formed well against the teams
they will face at the regional in its
tournament play this season.
Stanford is 4-0 versus Oklahoma
and Baylor in tournaments over
the fall and spring seasons, and
has only one loss to all teams in
the field over the entire year
to regional host Oregon at Febru
ary's Amer Ari Invitational. The
Ducks finished just two strokes in
front of the Card at the event.
Since the squad's trip to Hawaii,
it has won four of their five starts
and has seen every part of their
lineup blossom.
Veterans Patrick Rodgers and
Cameron Wilson continue to lead
Stanford at the front; Rodgers
still sits atop the World Amateur
Golf Rankings, with Wilson climbing
to sixth as he continues to enjoy a
rise in his stock over the recent
weeks. Freshman Maverick Mc-
Nealy has emerged during the
spring season as an excellent third
scorer for the Cardinal, with sopho
more David Boote nipping at his
heels.
After playing in just two of the
team's fall events, McNealy has
overcome the initial inconsistency
down the stretch, evidenced by his
69.6 scoring average over his past
three starts. Fellow freshman Yiraat
Badwhar will likely round out Stan
ford's quintet in Eugene the New
Delhi, India native will attempt to
replicate his solid T-16th perform
ance from the Pae-12 Champi
onships and give the Card the depth
they need to compete with the na
tion's best Wilson topped the
group by shooting even-par on the
16 par-3s he played over the four
round event.

In addition to getting production
from their two frontrunners and
turning solid third and fourth num

bers, the Card have also been focus
ing on improving their par-3 scoring
heading into regionals. It's certainly
an area that the unit should address,
given that none of the six players at
Pac-12s had a cumulative under-par
score on the par-3s at The Gallery
course.
"We've been having some great
practices and good competition in the
local area just amongst ourselves,"
Ray remarked of the group's focus
since the conference tournament.
"The guys are definitely feeling good
about their games and hopeful the
outcome will be what we're looking
for."
"We've been working hard on our
par-3 scoring, so we're trying to step
up some simulation on the par-3s
that we'll face at Eugene Country
Club, which are key holes on the golf
course: over water and difficult
holes," Ray added. "There's also
some premium on driving the golf
ball in the fairway, with some thick
rough and tighter fairways lined by
Oregon pines."
But perhaps more important
than the on-course challenge Stan
ford will face is the mental battle it
will have to wage in order to avoid
the letdown it suffered one year
ago. Though the team might not
admit it, the erash-and-burn of last

season's Columbus Regional is still
stuck in the craw of some and has
been a latent motivator this entire
campaign. There is no doubt that
this team is out to correct those
wrongs and strike back with a
vengeance.
"Last year was a tough one, no
questions asked," Ray said of 2013.
"But we were within a shot of the
lead going into the final round, and
we just played a tough round, a bad
round when we couldn't. I think our
guys also realize that we need to go
up to Eugene with the mindset of
winning the golf tournament, and
not playing to qualify or make the
cut."
"We want to go win and keep our
roll going and ride that momentum
as we go into NCAAs, hopefully," he
added. "I think the season we've had
this year will lend itself to that, and
I think our guys are using last year's
disappointment as good motivation
for when we turn up at regionals
being ready to go."
Play at the Eugene Country
Club begins today, with the 54-hole
regional wrapping up on Saturday.

Since the squad's trip to Hawaii,
it has won four of their five starts
and has seen every part of their
lineup blossom.
Veterans Patrick Rodgers and
Cameron Wilson continue to lead
Stanford at the front; Rodgers
still sits atop the World Amateur
Golf Rankings, with Wilson climbing
to sixth as he continues to enjoy a
rise in his stock over the recent
weeks. Freshman Maverick Mc-
Nealy has emerged during the
spring season as an excellent third
scorer for the Cardinal, with sopho
more David Boote nipping at his
heels.
After playing in just two of the
team's fall events, McNealy has
overcome the initial inconsistency
down the stretch, evidenced by his
69.6 scoring average over his past
three starts. Fellow freshman Yiraat
Badwhar will likely round out Stan
ford's quintet in Eugene the New
Delhi, India native will attempt to
replicate his solid T-16th perform
ance from the Pae-12 Champi
onships and give the Card the depth
they need to compete with the na
tion's best Wilson topped the
group by shooting even-par on the
16 par-3s he played over the four
round event.

In addition to getting production
from their two frontrunners and
turning solid third and fourth num

bers, the Card have also been focus
ing on improving their par-3 scoring
heading into regionals. It's certainly
an area that the unit should address,
given that none of the six players at
Pac-12s had a cumulative under-par
score on the par-3s at The Gallery
course.
"We've been having some great
practices and good competition in the
local area just amongst ourselves,"
Ray remarked of the group's focus
since the conference tournament.
"The guys are definitely feeling good
about their games and hopeful the
outcome will be what we're looking
for."
"We've been working hard on our
par-3 scoring, so we're trying to step
up some simulation on the par-3s
that we'll face at Eugene Country
Club, which are key holes on the golf
course: over water and difficult
holes," Ray added. "There's also
some premium on driving the golf
ball in the fairway, with some thick
rough and tighter fairways lined by
Oregon pines."
But perhaps more important
than the on-course challenge Stan
ford will face is the mental battle it
will have to wage in order to avoid
the letdown it suffered one year
ago. Though the team might not
admit it, the erash-and-burn of last

season's Columbus Regional is still
stuck in the craw of some and has
been a latent motivator this entire
campaign. There is no doubt that
this team is out to correct those
wrongs and strike back with a
vengeance.
"Last year was a tough one, no
questions asked," Ray said of 2013.
"But we were within a shot of the
lead going into the final round, and
we just played a tough round, a bad
round when we couldn't. I think our
guys also realize that we need to go
up to Eugene with the mindset of
winning the golf tournament, and
not playing to qualify or make the
cut."
"We want to go win and keep our
roll going and ride that momentum
as we go into NCAAs, hopefully," he
added. "I think the season we've had
this year will lend itself to that, and
I think our guys are using last year's
disappointment as good motivation
for when we turn up at regionals
being ready to go."
Play at the Eugene Country
Club begins today, with the 54-hole
regional wrapping up on Saturday.

Tired of being a part of underperforming teams during his time on the
Farm, senior Cameron Wilson (above) looks to lead his squad back to
the NCAA Championships after missing out on the Big Dance last year.
Looking to break through the
huge disappointment it suffered
at last year's regional and move
one step closer to their ultimate
goal of a national championship,
the Stanford men's golf team will
hit the Eugene Country Club
course today at the NCAA West
Regional. The Cardinal enter the
event as the regional's top seed,
with the hopes of keeping their
momentum rolling after winning
the Pac-12 Championship in dom
inating fashion a few weeks ago.
"We're excited about the
event," said Stanford head coach
Conrad Ray. "It's a traditional old
course that requires a lot of shot
making. It's not super long, but
there's a high premium for balls
in the fairway and controlling
your golf ball on the greens and
keeping the ball below the hole."
Not only will the layout in Eu
gene require some technical nav
igating, but the Card are also fac
ing a solid but manageable field.
The 13-team regional includes
No. 10 Houston, No. 15 Oklaho
ma and No. 22 South Carolina,
plus the Big South Conference
champion in Liberty. In order to
advance to the NCAA Champi
onships in Hutchinson, Kansas,
Stanford will need to finish in the
top five at the regional a for
gone conclusion to some when
considering the Cardinal's lofty
No. 3 ranking. But the squad re
alizes that despite its recent suc
cesses, nothing can be taken for
granted.
Still, Ray's group has per
formed well against the teams
they will face at the regional in its
tournament play this season.
Stanford is 4-0 versus Oklahoma
and Baylor in tournaments over
the fall and spring seasons, and
has only one loss to all teams in
the field over the entire year
to regional host Oregon at Febru
ary's Amer Ari Invitational. The
Ducks finished just two strokes in
front of the Card at the event.
