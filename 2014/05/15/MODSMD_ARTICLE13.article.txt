## RE-BOARDER AT LARGE CS+ X-traordinary 
### Liam Kinney 
T Tello potential employer,
Iâ€”l my name is Liam Kinney
.L J. and I am a Classics/Sym
bolic Systems double major at Stan
ford University" is how I've started
about 30 emails to various tech com
panies in Silicon Valley over the past
four months. The few who respond
often inquire about Symbolic Sys
tems a mix of CS, philosophy, lin
guistics and psychology and how
tech-heavy it actually is. I'm cor
nered into giving this feeble excuse
about how the Computer Science
major is too many units to double
with, and how I would never dream
of leaving the classics major, and
how Symbolic Systems is the next
best thing to Computer Science. I
haven't yet landed a job with this
system, but my system is about to
change.
Starting in the fall, the Universi
ty is offering brand new "CS + X"
majors, a new initiative headed by
English professor Nick Jenkins. In
this new and exciting program, you
can double major in CS and a con
centration in the humanities for a
reduced number of units. I learned
about it today while talking to clas
sics undergraduate major advisor
Giovanna Ceserani about how to
balance my already overwhelming
double major. A recent article in the
Daily (linked above) claims that the
program will allow a double major in
CS and either Music or English, but
Ceserani showed me a recent re
lease by the Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education that has an
nounced the joint majors passed by
the faculty senate: Classics, Eng
lish, French, German, History, Ital
ian, Linguistics, Music, Philosophy
and Slavic.
These programs are legitimate
academic pursuits. Along with re
ducing the number of electives re
quired in either major, the depart
ments require a capstone project
which demonstrates a synthesis of
CS and the humanities. Quoting
from the Daily article linked above,
"CS is becoming an integral part of
many humanities majors, and the
humanities are becoming important
in CS."
In a surprise twist, this effort
arose partly in response to requests
from "the Valley." These days, em
ployers in the South Bay are looking
for more than experience with sili
con alone. Perhaps you've heard
about New York Times columnist
Thomas L. Friedman and his two
part article "How to Get a Job at
Google." My parents certainly have
... In the article, Friedman inter
views Laszlo Bock, who is in charge
of hiring at Google and who over
sees about 100 new hires a day. In
part two of the article, published
just last month, Friedman asked
Bock "Are the liberal arts still im
portant?"
Not surprisingly, he responded
that "they are 'phenomenally im
portant' ... especially when you
combine them with other disci
plines." Bock went on to claim that
in his view, the most interesting
things he sees happening today are
at the intersection of two fields.
This is what I've been trying to con
vince my parents for years; not only
do the liberal arts set you apart
from your religiously tech-y peer,
but they also give you the necessary
context to which you can apply your
tech-y powers.
Even though this influential vote
for a CS-humanities combo major
has already been cast, I learned
from Ceserani that the Faculty Sen
ate was most tentative about admit
ting classics into the CS + X pro
gram. After all, how could a depart
ment that deals in literature written
almost exclusively before the Com-

mon Era connect to a department
that didn't exist until the twentieth
century?
Any student of classics should be
able to answer this question imme
diately. Latin and Greek are incred
ibly esoteric languages, in which
words come in all shapes and sizes
and have pages of definitions. And
even after you've memorized your
first year Latin textbook (yeah
right), authors tend to introduce
words of their own. Fun fact: The
poet Catullus is the only Latin au
thor ever to use the word
Mnemosynus, meaning "keep
sake". To stay sane, and to avoid
memorizing textbooks, Classics stu
dents use services like Tufts Uni
versity's Perseus Digital Library
and University of Notre Dame's
"William Whitaker's Words." Free
services like these compile gargan
tuan amounts of data from scads of
texts and provide the most likely
definitions of words and all the
forms they can possibly be. Crucial
Internet-driven services like these
helped me learn and love the clas
sics, and they will be at the heart of
classics research for years to come.
Do you think their inventors had ex
pertise in just one field?
If CS has practical applications
in ancient Greek, imagine the stake
it could have in some of the other hu
manities majors. Like the classics,
most of the humanities disciplines
are data-driven sciences. What if
people could learn to speak modern
languages not by finding someone
else who speaks the language, but
by having a conversation with a
computer? What if there was away
to mine Plato's Republic for philo
sophical tropes, and to locate reoc
currences of those tropes in contem
porary literature? The applications
are obvious in fields like music and
art; what's exciting is finding the
ways that computer science can en
hance the humanities, and vice
versa. CS + X is challenging stu
dents to do just that, and we know
all what happens when Stanford
students face a challenge.
