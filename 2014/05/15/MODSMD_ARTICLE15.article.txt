# THE 						COURT AND THE CONSTITUTION
## The 						Supreme Court, and the importance of keeping the lower courts in line 
### David Friedman Thomas Fu 
It is a truism that the Supreme
Court is not a court of error cor
rection. It decides the important
cases with wide-ranging implications
for the entire country and leaves the
everyday stuff for the lower courts.
There's good reason for this: Out of
the nearly eight thousand cases filed
in the Supreme Court every year, the
Court can only hear around eighty.
This means it needs to be choosy,
even if the result is letting lower court
decisions stand that a majority of the
Court thinks are just plain wrong.
Yet sometimes it just can't resist.
And as a result, the Court has devel
oped a tool the summary disposi
tion to help deal with the judicial
dilemma of wrongly decided cases
with particularly egregious facts but
little import for the larger develop
ment of the law.

What makes summary disposi
tions special is that these cases are
decided without the benefit of oral ar
gument or even a full briefing. Unlike
in a normal case, where the litigants
spar over the merits for several
months, when the Court acts via sum
mary disposition it simply decides
based on the certiorari-stage briefs
briefs whose arguments are dedi
cated almost exclusively to the ques
tion of whether the case is important
enough to be worthy of the Court's
review. This system has obvious
drawbacks: The quality of advocacy
before the Supreme Court is very
high, and it typically behooves the

Court to fully consider all of the legal
arguments before issuing an opinion
that will bind the entire country. But
it has benefits too: The summary dis
position process is less time-consum
ing and allows the Court to decide a
number of "easy" cases without tak
ing away too much from its normal
docket.

The Court's summary disposition
of Tolan v. Cotton, issued just last
week, demonstrates this tradeoff. As
with many summary judgments, any
discussion of Tolan must begin
with the facts. The incident that
led to the dispute in Tolan began
during the early morning hours of
Dec. 31, 2008, when police sergeant
John Edwards saw a black SUV turn
quickly onto a residential street and
then park in front of a house. Suspi
cious, Sergeant Edwards entered the
license plate number of the vehicle
into his computer; unfortunately, he
made a mistake he entered
"6958GK" instead of "6968GK."
Even more unfortunately, the incor
rect license plate number matched
that of a stolen car.
Sergeant Edwards accordingly
stepped out of his car pistol drawn
and ordered the two men who had
just gotten out of the car, Robert
Tolan and Anthony Cooper, to get on
the ground. After protesting that the
car was not stolen and that they were
just trying to go home, Tolan and
Cooper complied with the instruc
tions of Sergeant Edwards. Hearing
this commotion outside their home,
Tolan's parents came outside and
tried to defuse the situation. They
were unsuccessful.
Soon after, a second officer, Ser
geant Jeffrey Cotton, arrived on the
scene. Tolan's parents again tried to
explain that Tolan was their son and
driving their car, but Sergeant Cot
ton simply told Tolan's mother to
stand by the garage. At this point,
Tolan's mother became upset and re
fused to move away. Sergeant Cotton
thus attempted to physically escort
her to the garage. Although it re
mains in dispute how rough Sergeant
Cotton was with Tolan's mother, both
parties agree that Tolan rose off the
ground and yelled at Sergeant Cot
ton to get his hands off his mother. In
response, Sergeant Cotton immedi
ately drew his pistol and, with no ver
bal warning, fired three shots at
Tolan still standing 15 to 20 feet
away. One of the bullets struck Tolan
in the chest, collapsing his lung and
piercing his liver. Though he sur
vived, his promising baseball career
was cut short, and his injuries contin
ue to cause him pain on a daily basis.
At issue in the case is whether the
doctrine of qualified immunity ap
plies. Without delving too far into the
nuances of the doctrine, qualified im

munity shields officials from liability
for constitutional violations that were
not "clearly established" at the time
of the act. The idea is that it's not fair,
or wise, to subject officials to dam
ages when they had no advance no
tice that them conduct was wrongful.
In this case, the Southern District of
Texas and the Fifth Circuit Court of
Appeals found that Cotton did not
have sufficient notice that his choice
to shoot Tolan was unconstitutional at
the time of the incident to hold him li
able for damages. The Supreme
Court disagreed, unanimously hold
ing that Tolan should at least be able
to put on evidence at trial regarding
the disputed facts sketched above.
Intuitively, most would probably
agree that this feels like the right re
sult. Nevertheless, Justices Alito and
Scalia still felt compelled to write a
concurrence. Though agreeing with
the legal reasoning of the opinion,
they questioned whether it was ap
propriate for the Court to step into
this type of fact-bound dispute
and the wider realm of "error correc
tion."

This objection may however miss
the larger purpose of the summary
disposition. By reversing cases with
particularly egregious facts, such as
Tolan, the Court sends a message to
the lower courts. In this case, the
message to the Fifth Circuit Court of
Appeals often thought to be par
ticularly conservative is loud and
clear- The Fifth Circuit's judges need
to be more charitable to plaintiffs in
applying the standard for qualified
immunity. And politically, these mes
sages go both ways; in November, the
Supreme Court summarily reversed
a decision denying a police officer
qualified immunity that had been is
sued by the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals viewed by many as liber
al based just down the road in San
Francisco.

Justices Alito and Scalia, however,
are right that there are only so many
of these messages to go around.
There are ultimately many cases like
Tolan, and the Supreme Court does
not have the time to correct them all.
This highlights a point that may be
lost in a column that focuses on the
Supreme Court: The vast majority of
cases even important cases â€”do
not reach the Court. This makes the
lower courts, especially the twelve re
gional courts of appeals, much more
important than they often seem. And
it demonstrates the value of an occa
sional summary disposition to keep
these lower courts in line.
