# Levi's Stadium to host 2014 Pac-12 Football Championship game
## 
### â€“ Cameron Miller 
The Pac-12 Conference
will announce today that its
2014 football conference
championship game will be
held at the nearly completed
Levi's Stadium in Santa
Clara, California. Construc
tion on the venue is expected
to conclude sometime this
summer, with an MLS match
between the San Jose Earth
quakes and Seattle Sounders
FC on August 2 expected to
be the first sporting event at

the new $1.3 billion stadium.
With a tentative maxi
mum capacity of 68,500,
Levi's replaces the decades
old Candlestick Park as the
permanent home of the
NFEs San Francisco 49ers.
In addition, the stadium will
be the new host of the Fight
Hunger Bowl which has
been played at AT&T Park
since 2002 and Super
Bowl L on February 7, 2016.
Although it is unclear how
long the Pac-12 Champi
onship Game will remain at
Levi's Stadium, it is likely to
remain in the South Bay for
the foreseeable future.
The decision by the Pac
-12 marks the first time in the
league's history that the con
ference championship game
will be held at a neutral site.
In the past three seasons, the
team with the better record
between the Pac-12 North
and South division champi
ons has hosted the confer
ence title tilt. During that
time, Oregon, Stanford and
Arizona State have each
served as host.
The 2014 Pac-12 Champi
onship is scheduled for Fri
day, December 5.
