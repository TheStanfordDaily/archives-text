# Workshop elicits two sculptures
## Construction unique in both material and design 
### NITISH KULKARNI DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
For over a week now, students have hiked
past new, oddly designed structures built near
the grass mounds on the Science and Engi
neering Quad lawns, right in front of the Jen-
Hsun Huang Engineering Center. The struc
tures, which are big enough for students to
walk through and under, are not just unique
and artistic in their construction they are
also innovative.
These two structures, according to Bever
ly Choe, lecturer in Stanford's Architectural
Design Program, were part of a two-weekend
workshop in the beginning of May, titled "Ex
periments on Geometries and Dynamics."
The workshop, which was run by the Ar
chitectural Design Program in the Depart
ment of Civil and Environmental Engineer
ing, was led by Jun Sato, an associate profes
sor in the Department of Architecture at the
University of Tokyo.

Sato, whose work focuses on the design of
innovative structures for installations rang
ing from housing to public buildings, was in
vited by Choe to host a design-build work
shop at Stanford. During the workshop, stu
dents were challenged to think in new ways.
"[The students] focused on tensegrity
structures and folded geometrical structures

inspired by pop-up books," Choe said. "The
workshop asked students to investigate and
test the structural properties of materials,
ranging from off-the-shelf hardware store
items like metal conduit and wood members
to washi [Japanese paper]."
The structures one representing
tensegrity and the other portraying pop-up
inspiration were as the concluding activity
for the workshop and were originally intend
ed to be built straight away earlier this

month, said John Barton, director of the Ar
chitectural Design Program. However, issues
with obtaining permission to use the lawn
pushed the actual building of the structures
to a later time.

According to Sebastian Mancera 'l5, one
of the 15 student participants of the work
shop, the first weekend of the workshop was
spent building prototypes while the second
was dedicated to building the structures.
Sato was heavily involved in both processes.

"It was fascinating to see [Sato] work,"
Mancera said.

The tensegrity structure was assembled
pipe by pipe, while the pop-up structure was
first assembled as a flat structure and then
raised up from its folded configuration.
"We had to pull on one side [of the structure],
and then the whole thing popped up," he said.
However, Mancera also acknowledged the

difficulties of building the struc
tures.
"It was a challenge to get beams
and cables to work together per
fectly," he said, adding that balance

was imperative to keep the structure
standing.
Despite the obstacles that were
brought about by the building of
the structures, the structures are
still standing, and continue to at
tract considerable interest from
passer-bys and students.
