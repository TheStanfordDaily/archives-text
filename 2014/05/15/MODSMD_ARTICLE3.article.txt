## Executives select 19 Cabinet members Woodson, Richard discuss future goals for Cabinet 
### ANDREW VOGELEY DESK EDITOR 
Every ASSU executive's first of
ficial action is filling out their cabi
net. Each executive has considerable
leeway in determining how to struc
ture their cabinet from the num
ber of positions to the titles given to
each member.
The Daily sat down to talk to the
new executives, Elizabeth Woodson
'l5 and Logan Richard 'l5, to briefly
discuss what kind of a team they
were forming and the goals and aspi
rations they have for their cabinet.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What
were you looking for in your cabinet
members?
Elizabeth Woodson (EW): We were
looking for experts: people that have
spent a lot of time working on some
thing they care about, and people
that want to tackle big challenges.

That was because we do have an am
bitious agenda, and that is directly
representative of what we heard
from the students. All the issues are
very connected. After four months of
conversations, we knew change was
possible with time, and people that
cared. And so we've been over
whelmed by the degree and outpour
ing of energy for things that people
care about.

Logan Richard (LR): We got 87 ap
plications, drawing from an incredi
ble breadth of knowledge and ener
gy and age. In structuring our cab
inet, we have 19 cabinet members
with a particular focus on things we
identified during our four months
of campaigning, such as mental
health and how it manifests itself
within different communities. So in
addition to having a mental health
cabinet head, we will be having
mental health for athletes. Also, we
will focus on a greater amalgama
tion of connections connecting
students to events, community cen
ters to community centers. We've
got some superstars across the
board. The cabinet heads will be

working with action squads. We
wanted to work with as many peo
ple as possible.

EW: I was on the cabinet last year,
and Dan and Billy did an awesome
job of giving autonomy. They chose
people for projects they knew they
wanted to work on and let them run
with it. What I learned from the end
of [this] year was that I built a team
from shared experience and interest
and was able to do more in the last
two weeks because of these people.
So we wanted to start off our cabinet
heads with these teams. The two of
us cannot do this. Not even 20 of us
can do this. So it's really important
that we continue to bring as many
people in as we can.
TSD: Are you going to set goals for
these cabinet members?

EW: We are going to spend a lot of
time sharing our vision and what we
see Stanford looking like in a year.
From the research we did over the
last four months, a lot of solutions to
problems came out of that. So we are
going to give the cabinet something
to run with and experiment with. We
will set bigger goals. We are going to
be strict about meeting them. We are
going to do this [through] testing
and constant conversation, because
that's how we feel we were able to do
the campaign. We need to continue
that.
There are three pieces of the cab
inet that we are really excited about:
the chief fun officer '(CFO), the em
pathy and testing team and the sto
rytelling team. The CFO is in charge
of making fun for the campus.
The second is this idea of the test
ing and empathizing team. We want
to get constant stories from stu
dents, and they will come in twice a
week, and the other groups will come
up with questions and t then go to
whatever demographic of campus
that needs to be understood better
just talk to people and get feedback.
The third piece that we are excited
about that's kind of different is focused
on storytelling. This was the core take
away from a couple months of re
search. We hear these crazy stories
and you're like wow, this is awesome,
but that's the final product. You don't
hear about the years and months and
