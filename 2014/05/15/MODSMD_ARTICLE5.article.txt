# STUDENT LIFE
## Water Group develops three sustainable projects 
### ANDREW VOGELEY DESK EDITOR 
With California's statewide
drought affecting Stanford, ef
forts to reduce water consump
tion and increase sustainability
have come to the forefront.
The Water Group, a branch of
Students for a Sustainable Stan
ford (SSS), has recently complet
ed two projects and finalized
plans for another that will at
tempt to make Stanford a more
sustainable campus.

Water bottle refill station
For the first project, the

Water Group partnered with the
Graduate Student Council (GSC)
to install a water bottle refill sta
tion on the second floor of Old
Union. There were already sev
eral refill stations on campus, but
none were in centrally located or
heavily trafficked areas.
Both the Water Group and the
GSC had come to the conclusion
that a refill station had to be es
tablished, and they joined efforts
to obtain funding from the Green
Fund, a funding pool from the Of
fice of Sustainability given to
groups on campus for projects
