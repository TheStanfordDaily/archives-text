## Water Group develops three sustainable projects 
### ANDREW VOGELEY DESK EDITOR 
With California's statewide
drought affecting Stanford, ef
forts to reduce water consump
tion and increase sustainability
have come to the forefront.
The Water Group, a branch of
Students for a Sustainable Stan
ford (SSS), has recently complet
ed two projects and finalized
plans for another that will at
tempt to make Stanford a more
sustainable campus.

Water bottle refill station
For the first project, the

Water Group partnered with the
Graduate Student Council (GSC)
to install a water bottle refill sta
tion on the second floor of Old
Union. There were already sev
eral refill stations on campus, but
none were in centrally located or
heavily trafficked areas.
Both the Water Group and the
GSC had come to the conclusion
that a refill station had to be es
tablished, and they joined efforts
to obtain funding from the Green
Fund, a funding pool from the Of
fice of Sustainability given to
groups on campus for projects

promoting sustainability.
"We were planning on applying
for a Green Fund last fall to fund the
project when we realized that SSS
also was intending to apply for a
Green Fund for the same idea," said
Susie Choi 'l2 J.D. 'l5, member of
theGSC.
"Teaming up with the GSC was a
good way to show the administra
tion that there was a broader group
of students that wanted this to hap
pen," said Laura Cussen 'l5, co
leader of the Water Group.
Cussen noted that the refill sta
tion includes a counter, allowing the
group to track the effect of the sta
tion. Installed just two weeks ago,
the station had been used 217 times
as of Wednesday.
"Old Union, prior to the installa
tion of the water-filling station
[which includes a water fountain in
the lower half of the unit], had zero
water fountains," Choi said.
If all goes well with the refill sta
tion in Old Union, the group hopes
to add more of them around cam
pus, particularly in bustling aca

demic buildings.
Ozone cleaning solution
At the beginning of spring quar
ter, the group began another pilot
program to test a more sustainable
cleaning solution, installing a small
machine in Columbae that converts
tap water into an aqueous ozone
cleaning solution.
"We wanted to do a different
type of project and we ended up
finding this product," said Andrew
Jacobs 'l6, co-leader of the Water
Group. "The aqueous ozone will kill
bacteria because it's so reactive, but
its final end products are water
vapor and oxygen gas, so it's com
pletely sustainable and you don't
have any chemical residue like you
have with other chemical cleaners."
In the long term, the group
hopes that they can introduce the
machine in other co-ops. Ideally, the
ozone cleaning solution would be
come the primary cleaning tool to
be adopted by Residential and Din
ing Enterprises (R&DE), however
the group has not had any conversa
tions with R&DE yet.

Rainwater recycling system
The final project the Water
Group has been developing is in
stalling a rainwater recycling sys

tem at Synergy, which will act as the
primary source of water for the gar
den on the side of the house.
According to Cussen, the rain
water system was in the making for
the past four years. The project was
delayed because of various adminis
trative and financial barriers.
"The obstacle was getting all the
people at Stanford Housing and all
the bureaucracy in line, in addition
to obtaining the funding," Cussen
said.
However, despite the postpone
ment of the Water Group's plans,
they hope to install the rainwater
system by the end of this academic
year.
Ultimately, the group hopes that
their three projects the water
bottle refill station, ozone cleaner
and rainwater system will have
an impact beyond the water and en
ergy they will conserve.
"We are actually getting things
done... and I think the idea that we
can set some sort of an example as a
student body by using sustainable
practices feels so much more grati
fying than simply raising aware
ness," Cussen said.

project when we realized that SSS
also was intending to apply for a
Green Fund for the same idea," said
Susie Choi 'l2 J.D. 'l5, member of
theGSC.
"Teaming up with the GSC was a
good way to show the administra
tion that there was a broader group
of students that wanted this to hap
pen," said Laura Cussen 'l5, co
leader of the Water Group.
Cussen noted that the refill sta
tion includes a counter, allowing the
group to track the effect of the sta
tion. Installed just two weeks ago,
the station had been used 217 times
as of Wednesday.
"Old Union, prior to the installa
tion of the water-filling station
[which includes a water fountain in
the lower half of the unit], had zero
water fountains," Choi said.
If all goes well with the refill sta
tion in Old Union, the group hopes
to add more of them around cam
pus, particularly in bustling aca

demic buildings.
Ozone cleaning solution
At the beginning of spring quar
ter, the group began another pilot
program to test a more sustainable
cleaning solution, installing a small
machine in Columbae that converts
tap water into an aqueous ozone
cleaning solution.
"We wanted to do a different
type of project and we ended up
finding this product," said Andrew
Jacobs 'l6, co-leader of the Water
Group. "The aqueous ozone will kill
bacteria because it's so reactive, but
its final end products are water
vapor and oxygen gas, so it's com
pletely sustainable and you don't
have any chemical residue like you
have with other chemical cleaners."
In the long term, the group
hopes that they can introduce the
machine in other co-ops. Ideally, the
ozone cleaning solution would be
come the primary cleaning tool to
be adopted by Residential and Din
ing Enterprises (R&DE), however
the group has not had any conversa
tions with R&DE yet.

Rainwater recycling system
The final project the Water
Group has been developing is in
stalling a rainwater recycling sys

tem at Synergy, which will act as the
primary source of water for the gar
den on the side of the house.
According to Cussen, the rain
water system was in the making for
the past four years. The project was
delayed because of various adminis
trative and financial barriers.
"The obstacle was getting all the
people at Stanford Housing and all
the bureaucracy in line, in addition
to obtaining the funding," Cussen
said.
However, despite the postpone
ment of the Water Group's plans,
they hope to install the rainwater
system by the end of this academic
year.
Ultimately, the group hopes that
their three projects the water
bottle refill station, ozone cleaner
and rainwater system will have
an impact beyond the water and en
ergy they will conserve.
"We are actually getting things
done... and I think the idea that we
can set some sort of an example as a
student body by using sustainable
practices feels so much more grati
fying than simply raising aware
ness," Cussen said.
