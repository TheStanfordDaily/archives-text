## A 						host of issues with the MLB All-Star Game 
### Do-Hyoung Park 
With just over a
month of the Major
League Baseball
regular season
gone, it's the time
of year again at which MLB.com re
minds you approximately 20 times
every time you visit its website to re
member to vote for the starters for
this year's All-Star Game.
But even though my Colorado
Rockies are sure to be well-represent
ed on the NL roster, and the host site
this year is back home in Minneapolis,
I think that it's indicative of the sad
state of the Midsummer Classic that I
don't feel particularly compelled or
compelled at all, for that matter—to
go see the spectacle for myself.
Why, you ask?
1. For god's sake, don't let this cha
rade of an exhibition game have any
tangible impact on the actual sea
son
I will never, ever understand the
reasoning behind Commissioner
Selig's decision to make the All-Star
Game determine home-field advan
tage for the World Series. It was an
attempt to make the game actually
mean something instead of falling
into the sad, sad niche occupied by
the Pro Bowl. Clearly, that hasn't
done much to help the reputation of
the game even hurting it in the
eyes of baseball fans around the na
tion, due to its perception as a des
peration ploy. While fans certainly
turn out for the festivities every
year, people don't go for the actual
game; they go for the novelty and
uniqueness of the experience.
So for an exhibition game played
in a manner that isn't anything like
a normal game of baseball (due to
the myriad of substitutions) and
that is treated accordingly by many
fans around the nation, I think it's
absurd that something that can be
as crucial and pivotal as home-field
advantage in the World Series
comes anywhere near the sphere of
the All-Star Game. As a Min
nesotan, I'll just turn to the Twins'
1987 and 1991 World Series victo
ries to show how important home
field advantage can be.
Do we really want a potential
late-game matchup between an ob
scure middle reliever from the A's
and the catcher from the Padres
that was only included on the roster
because San Diego needed a repre
sentative to have repercussions in
October? Absolutely not. And this
last point brings me to my next ele
ment ...

2. Make the rosters smaller so
that gameplay and strategy is at
least somewhat similar to that of
a regular baseball game

Thirty-four players per roster?
Are you kidding me?
Consider an "average" regular
season game like yesterday's game
between the White Sox and A's.
Each team used 14 players —lO
hitters and four pitchers during
the course of the game. That's pret
ty par for the course in any Ameri
can League baseball game.
Now, let's look at last year's All-
Star Game. The AL alone used 29
players. The NL used a whopping
26. In your standard nine-inning
game, that averages out to around
two players per position per team
and a new pitcher every inning.
In any baseball game, a signifi
cant strategic element comes from
the fact that the pitcher on the
mound wears down as the game
goes on, and hitters are better
equipped to take advantage of the
pitcher's offerings in his second and
third time through the order, due to
the increased familiarity. At the All-
Star Game, that's completely gone
thanks to the revolving door on the
mound, making the game almost
farcical from a baseball strategist's
perspective.
Because managers are almost
obligated to put in every player that
they have, the only solution seems
to be to cut the rosters down to size
to avoid having players make the
trip to Minneapolis to ride the bench
(sorry, A-Rod). This actually makes
it so that the matchups that we
want to see (and not the ones that
we're forced to see due to substitu
tion scrambles) are happening to
wards the end of the game.
C ome on. I don't want to see Troy
Tulowitzki (as the starter) have a
less meaningful at-bat in the first in-

ning. I want to see him stay in
the game until the ninth in
ning and hit with the game on
the line. I want to see Yu
Darvish battle into the sev
enth inning and watch NL
hitters try to make adjust
ments.
This can happen if...
3. MLB gets rid of the rule
requiring at least one play
er from each team to be in
cluded on the roster
I kind of get this one; it
makes the game a much
more national affair, and
gives fans from all of the
major media markets
around the United States a
stake in the game. But I
think that all this does is
bloat the rosters and, like I
mentioned before, make for
less meaningful matchups
later in the game when man
agers are inevitably forced
to rotate them in.
Take last season's AL
roster, for example. The
Rays needed a representa
tive, leading to the selection
of Ben Zobrist as the fourth
second baseman on the
team. I love Zobrist to death,
but that spot should serious
ly have gone to either Josh
Donaldson or Adrian Beltre.
The rule really distorts the
contributions that deserving
players have made through
the season and takes spots
away from them.
And really, would it mat
ter that much to those fan
bases to not have a player se
lected? Even as a Min
nesotan, I'd place a much
higher importance on seeing
a good, high-quality baseball
game between the super
stars of the game (that
America wants to see
they voted them in as
starters, after all!) than on
seeing Joe Mauer get three
innings behind the plate and
contribute to the farce of an
exhibition that is the current
All-Star Game.
Finally, while we're on

the topic of fanbases around
the nation...
4. Personalize the game
watching experience for
each city
Is there anybody that
likes Joe Buck and Tim Mc-
Carver on the call for any
baseball game broadcast on
Fox? Personally, I'd much
rather listen to Sam Fisher
and Michael Peterson
though I may be biased, of
course. But in all serious
ness, I think that a good way
to embody the different ex
periences that each city has
to offer and connect that to
not just the people at the
game itself, but also for the
people watching at home, is
to personalize the broadcast
for each city.
Namely: Let each team's
home TV and radiobroad
casting crews announce each
game instead of Buck and
McCarver!
The home crews know the
nuances and experiences of
each city, and would offer a
different, personalized per
spective year after year for
the people watching at home,
so that the viewers are actu
ally able to experience the
fact that the game travels be
tween cities.
It would also be a really
cool way for the broadcasters
to get national exposure and
would depending on the
broadcasters, I guess give
the people of the city some
thing to look forward to from
the voices that they follow
throughout the season.
One caveat: Let's all
agree to make an exception
for Hawk Harrelson. If I had
to listen to the guy for a
whole All-Star Game, I'd end
up throwing something at the
television.

Despite Do-Hyoung Park's
strange affinity for the Rock
ies, he knows deep dawn in
his heart-of-hearts that
Dodger Yasiel Puig deserves
a spot in Minneapolis. Tell
him. why the Cuban caballero
should be selected at
dparko27@stanford.edu and
Tweet him at @dohyoung
park.
