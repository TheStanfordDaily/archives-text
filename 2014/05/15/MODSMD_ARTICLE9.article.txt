# BIG SLAM GETS BIGGER

### FIONA NOONAN STAFF WRITER 
As the No. 11 Stanford women's
tennis team heads off to Athens,
Georgia for the NCAA round of 16
this Thursday, it'll be entering famil
ial* territory.
Bear territory, that is.
For the third time this year, the
Cardinal (18-2, 8-2 Pac-12) will face
off against No. 6 Cal (20-4,10-0 Pac

12), and this time the stakes are
higher than ever. In their last meet
ing, Cal downed Stanford 6-1 to cap
ture the Pac-12 title and hand the
Cardinal only them fifth home loss in
the last 15 years.

"I think it'll be a great match,"
said freshman Caroline Doyle. "Ob
viously they won 6-1 [last time], but
I think the scores were a lot closer.
There were a lot of three-set [match
es], I really think it'll be a great bat

tie and I definitely think we have a
great opportunity to make it to the
next round."
On Thursday, the name of the
game will be revenge for the Cardi
nal, which are on a mission to repli
cate last year's N CAA run and claim
an 18th national title for the
women's tennis program. Although
it won't be easy to take down the
Bears, who are entering the match
on a 14-match winning streak, there
will be plenty of reasons for Cal to
fear the Tree in Athens.
"We're really helping to go and
get some revenge against them,"
Doyle said. "We know their team re
ally well, so we know what we need
to work on to be where we need to be
by Thursday. I think we're just ap
proaching it one match at a time but
trying not to see it as our last
match."
The last blemish on the Bears'
record is a non-conference loss
against Stanford in March, and
when players from both teams faced
off in the Pac-12 Individual Champi
onships at the end of April, the Card
took multiple victories against Cal,
including against its number one
doubles team.
That said, it could be anyone's
game during the third installment of
the Big Slam. The Bears come in
with enormous singles talent behind
18th-ranked Anett Schutting, 23rd
ranked Zsofi Susanyi and 24th
ranked Lynn Chi. Chi ended Stan
ford freshman Carol Zhao's run in
the Pac-12 Tournament, and the two
could very well meet again on
Thursday.

is to exact revenge on rival Cal and keep the team's title defense hopes alive in the NCAA round of 16.
