# BIG SLAM GETS BIGGER

### FIONA NOONAN STAFF WRITER 
As the No. 11 Stanford women's
tennis team heads off to Athens,
Georgia for the NCAA round of 16
this Thursday, it'll be entering famil
ial* territory.
Bear territory, that is.
For the third time this year, the
Cardinal (18-2, 8-2 Pac-12) will face
off against No. 6 Cal (20-4,10-0 Pac

12), and this time the stakes are
higher than ever. In their last meet
ing, Cal downed Stanford 6-1 to cap
ture the Pac-12 title and hand the
Cardinal only them fifth home loss in
the last 15 years.

"I think it'll be a great match,"
said freshman Caroline Doyle. "Ob
viously they won 6-1 [last time], but
I think the scores were a lot closer.
There were a lot of three-set [match
es], I really think it'll be a great bat

tie and I definitely think we have a
great opportunity to make it to the
next round."
On Thursday, the name of the
game will be revenge for the Cardi
nal, which are on a mission to repli
cate last year's N CAA run and claim
an 18th national title for the
women's tennis program. Although
it won't be easy to take down the
Bears, who are entering the match
on a 14-match winning streak, there
will be plenty of reasons for Cal to
fear the Tree in Athens.
"We're really helping to go and
get some revenge against them,"
Doyle said. "We know their team re
ally well, so we know what we need
to work on to be where we need to be
by Thursday. I think we're just ap
proaching it one match at a time but
trying not to see it as our last
match."
The last blemish on the Bears'
record is a non-conference loss
against Stanford in March, and
when players from both teams faced
off in the Pac-12 Individual Champi
onships at the end of April, the Card
took multiple victories against Cal,
including against its number one
doubles team.
That said, it could be anyone's
game during the third installment of
the Big Slam. The Bears come in
with enormous singles talent behind
18th-ranked Anett Schutting, 23rd
ranked Zsofi Susanyi and 24th
ranked Lynn Chi. Chi ended Stan
ford freshman Carol Zhao's run in
the Pac-12 Tournament, and the two
could very well meet again on
Thursday.

Freshman Taylor Davidson (above) will have to play a solid doubles match with partner Ellen Tsay if Stanford
is to exact revenge on rival Cal and keep the team's title defense hopes alive in the NCAA round of 16.
The Cardinal will be
packing a punch of their own,
though, with third-ranked
senior Kristie Ahn, 21st
ranked Zhao and 51st
ranked sophomore Krista
Hardebeck leading the
charge in singles. Doyle, cur
rently ranked No. 57, will
also be a force, and is riding
good momentum after
clinching the Cardinal's sec
ond-round match against
Long Beach State last Satur
day.
Doubles will be another in
tense matchup. In the teams'
last meeting, Cal narrowly
took the doubles point, but
after Ahn and Zhao beat the
Bears' Chi and Schutting at
the Pac-12s, the tables could
turn this time around. Junior
Ellen Tsay and freshman Tay
lor Davidson will also have a
big role to play, as the only duo
to have come close to beating
Cal on Senior Day.
Despite the challenge
ahead for Stanford, the team
knows how to make waves as
the underdog. Last season,
the team went into the NCAA
Tournament as the 12 seed
and ended up winning the
whole event.
"It feels like a similar situa
tion to last year, where we've
got a conference foe that was
tough on us in the round of 16,"
head coach Lele Forood told

GoStanford.com. "It seems
like we've been here before."

Furthermore, each one of
the six players in the lineup
knows how to deal with high
pressure situations from their
experiences in international
tournaments or previous
N CAA postseasons.
Fortunately, the Cardinal
won't have the added pressure
of maintaining Stanford's
overall national championship
winning streak, which disap
peared over the weekend with
women's water polo's victory
over UCLA. This time last
year, women's tennis was one
of the few teams with a shot at
a title, and pulled through to
make it 37 years in a row.
Before the tournament,
50th-ranked Davidson had de
scribed the potential pressure
to maintain the streak as
"nerve-wracking." In the
match versus Cal, that's no
longer a factor.
Regardless of who wins,
the match also represents the
greater powerhouse that is
the Pac-12. The winner of the
round of 16 will get one step
closer to the finals, which has
featured a Pac-12 team in 29 of
the past 32 NCAA tourna
ments.

A victory for Stanford on
Thursday will send the team
to the quarterfinals on Satur
day, which will also be played
at the Dan Magill Tennis
Complex in Athens. There,
they would face the winner of
the No. 3 Virginia vs. No. 14
Baylor match.
Overall, the outlook is
good for Stanford on Thurs
day, and the team is ready to
once again take on its top con
ference foe as it aims for an
18th title.
