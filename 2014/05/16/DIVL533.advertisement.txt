DELICIOUS PEACE
COFFEE, MUSIC AND JEWISH, MUSLIM AND
CHRISTIAN HARMONY IN UGANDA
TUESDAY, MAY 20, 7:00 PM
BUILDING 370, ROOM 370
Rabbi Jeffrey Summit (Tufts University Jewish
Chaplain and Executive Director of Tufts
Hillel) and photojournalist Richard Sobol will
share a multimedia presentation about their
involvement with Delicious Peace. It is a story
of coffee, music and world peace.
The coffee is grown by more than 1000
Christians, Muslims and Jews who live in
a rural region of Uganda and are members
of a fair trade cooperative called Mirembe
Kawomera - which translates to Delicious
Peace in Luganda. Delicious Peace coffee and
dessert will be served after the presentation.
All are welcome.
