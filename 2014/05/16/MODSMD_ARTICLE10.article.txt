## CREW Crews seek gold at Natoma 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
It is conference championship weekend for Stan
ford rowing as the men's, women's and lightweight
teams are all set to compete in their respective confer
ence championships. All three teams will travel to Lake
Natoma in Gold River, California, for their champi
onships the Pac-12 Championships will take place
on Sunday for the men's and women's teams, while
the PCRC Championships will be held on Saturday for
the lightweight team.

After winning the Big Row in convincing fashion
for only the third time since 1997, No. 3 Stanford
women's rowing will look to cap off one of the most
successful seasons in recent memory with a confer
ence championship. The Cardinal enter as the top
ranked team in the competition with No. 4 Cal, No. 7
Washington, No. 8 USC, No. 12 UCLA, No. 15 Wash
ington State and No. 19 Oregon State as the other
ranked Pac-12 competitors.

Stanford is no stranger to tough competition,
however, having also faced off against No. 1 Brown,
No. 2 Ohio State, No. 5 Virginia and No. 9 Michigan
this season in addition to its tough Pac-12 matchups.
At the time, the Cardinal's varsity four handed Virginia
its first defeat of the season. With a victory at the con
ference championship, Stanford could end Cal's streak
of six consecutive Pac-12 championships; the Bears
have also won nine of the last 10 Pac-12 titles.

After four consecutive runner-up finishes from
2008-2011, women's rowing has finished fourth and
fifth in the past two years, respectively. By beating Cal
and securing the Lambert Cup for the first time since
2009, Stanford might be poised to make a run at its
first Pac-12 title in history.
No. 12 Stanford men's rowing
will be hoping to win its first confer
ence title in history and make its
first top-two finish since 1993, with
the Cardinal having finished either
third or fourth at every conference
championship since then. In all but
one of those years, Washington and
Cal have taken the top two spots in
the conference, and it will take the
Cardinal's best performance to take

them down Washington is
ranked first in the country while Cal
is ranked second.

The Cardinal varsity eight boat
has recorded three first-place finish
es this year at the Davis Invitational,
the San Diego Crew Classic and the
Stanford Invitational, including a
win against then-No. 12 Wisconsin.
In its last contest, men's rowing was
forced to surrender the Schwabach
er Cup in the Big Row when Cal's
varsity eight boat finished just
under 10 seconds ahead of the Car
dinal's. Led by last year's Pac-12
Athlete of the Year, senior Austin
Hack, the Cardinal will attempt to

take revenge against Washington,
Cal and other Pac-12 schools on
Sunday.
The lightweight rowing team,
currently ranked second in the na
tion, will enter two races in the
PCRC championships. Two boats
will compete in the Women's Open
8+ race and three boats will com
pete in the Women's Collegiate 4+
race. Stanford should be favored to
win, as the varsity eight boat has
won seven of its nine races this year,
including a win in the Big Row
against Cal in its last competition.
Following the PCRC Champi
onships, women's lightweight row

ing will row in the IRA Champi
onships, looking for its fifth straight
national title.

Stanford rowing will start off
the weekend Saturday morning
when the lightweight rowing team
begins its competition at 10:10 a.m.

and

women's rowing teams will begin

The Cardinal varsity eight boat
has recorded three first-place finish
es this year at the Davis Invitational,
the San Diego Crew Classic and the
Stanford Invitational, including a
win against then-No. 12 Wisconsin.
In its last contest, men's rowing was
forced to surrender the Schwabach
er Cup in the Big Row when Cal's
varsity eight boat finished just
under 10 seconds ahead of the Car
dinal's. Led by last year's Pac-12
Athlete of the Year, senior Austin
Hack, the Cardinal will attempt to

take revenge against Washington,
Cal and other Pac-12 schools on
Sunday.
The lightweight rowing team,
currently ranked second in the na
tion, will enter two races in the
PCRC championships. Two boats
will compete in the Women's Open
8+ race and three boats will com
pete in the Women's Collegiate 4+
race. Stanford should be favored to
win, as the varsity eight boat has
won seven of its nine races this year,
including a win in the Big Row
against Cal in its last competition.
Following the PCRC Champi
onships, women's lightweight row

ing will row in the IRA Champi
onships, looking for its fifth straight
national title.

Stanford rowing will start off
the weekend Saturday morning
when the lightweight rowing team
begins its competition at 10:10 a.m.
Subsequently on Sunday, the men's
and

women's rowing teams will begin
their days at 9 a.m. The men's and
women's Pac-12 Championships
can be seen on the Pac-12 Net
works.
