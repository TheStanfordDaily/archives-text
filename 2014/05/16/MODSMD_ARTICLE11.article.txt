Forget Duck Hunting Season. For
the No. 11 Stanford women's tennis
team (18-2, 8-2 Pac-12), Bear Hunting
Season was in full swing on Thursday, as
the Cardinal took down No. 6 Cal (20-5,
10-0 Pac-12) to claim a spot in the Elite
Eight of the NCAA Tournament. The Big
Slam rematch between the two Pac-12
powerhouses was touted as the best of
the Sweet 16 matchups prior to Thurs
day's action, and the match certainly lived
up to the hype.
The day got off to a rather inauspi
cious start, as rain in Athens, Georgia, ul-

timately delayed the match for two
hours, forcing the teams to make the hour
and a half trek to the indoor courts at

Georgia Tech in Atlanta. After getting in a
quick warm-up in mint green "Talk Nerdy
to Me" shirts, the Cardinal got down to
business as usual.

The doubles point was almost an
exact repeat of the doubles point from
Stanford's Senior Day, when Cal took the
point and went on to take the entire
match. Coming in, the odds looked good
for Stanford to strike first blood, though,
especially after the No. 10-ranked duo of
senior Kristie Ahn and freshman Carol
Zhao took down Cal's No. 41 Lynn Chi
and Anett Schutting at the Pac-12 Tourna
ment last month.

Unfortunately, the point slipped
away after an 8-4 loss by freshman Caro
line Doyle and senior Amelia Herring,
who has been playing in place of Doyle's
regular-season partner, sophomore Krista
