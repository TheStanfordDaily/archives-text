## DOYLE'S PUSH SHOCKS BEARS

Forget Duck Hunting Season. For
the No. 11 Stanford women's tennis
team (18-2, 8-2 Pac-12), Bear Hunting
Season was in full swing on Thursday, as
the Cardinal took down No. 6 Cal (20-5,
10-0 Pac-12) to claim a spot in the Elite
Eight of the NCAA Tournament. The Big
Slam rematch between the two Pac-12
powerhouses was touted as the best of
the Sweet 16 matchups prior to Thurs
day's action, and the match certainly lived
up to the hype.
The day got off to a rather inauspi
cious start, as rain in Athens, Georgia, ul-

timately delayed the match for two
hours, forcing the teams to make the hour
and a half trek to the indoor courts at

Georgia Tech in Atlanta. After getting in a
quick warm-up in mint green "Talk Nerdy
to Me" shirts, the Cardinal got down to
business as usual.

The doubles point was almost an
exact repeat of the doubles point from
Stanford's Senior Day, when Cal took the
point and went on to take the entire
match. Coming in, the odds looked good
for Stanford to strike first blood, though,
especially after the No. 10-ranked duo of
senior Kristie Ahn and freshman Carol
Zhao took down Cal's No. 41 Lynn Chi
and Anett Schutting at the Pac-12 Tourna
ment last month.

Unfortunately, the point slipped
away after an 8-4 loss by freshman Caro
line Doyle and senior Amelia Herring,
who has been playing in place of Doyle's
regular-season partner, sophomore Krista

Freshman Caroline Doyle (above) spurred the Cardinal to an improbable comeback victory against rival Cal onThursday, as she defended
two match points while facing a 5-3 deficit in the decisive third set, before going on to eventually tie the set at 6-6 and win in a tiebreaker.

Hardebeck, and a rare setback for junior Ellen
Tsay and freshman Taylor Davidson.
For the Cardinal, going down 1-0 has not
been a good sign on previous occasions this sea
son, as both regular season losses came after
losing the doubles point to UCLA and Cal. On
Thursday, though, past history had no bearing
on the final outcome.

Despite a quick loss on court two by No.
51 Hardebeck, the Card kept its focus and
pulled to within 2-1 after a rock-solid perform
ance from No. 21 Zhao, who breezed past No.
18 Schutting on court three. It was a much
needed win for the freshman after a disap
pointing Pac-12 Tournament performance and
a rare singles loss during the previous match
against Cal. Subsequently, a victory on court
one by No. 3 Ahn evened the score, but when
No. 54 Tsay dropped her match to Klara Fabiko
va to put the Bears ahead 3-2, the pressure was
on for the Cardinal, setting the stage for the
drama.

On court four, No. 50 Davidson looked
strong through the first two sets. However, she
began cramping up in the third set, requiring a
trainer to attend to her on the court. After a
brief injury timeout, though, she only got
stronger, firing groundstrokes and serves for
which Cal's Chi had no response. Once David
son took the third set in her own match, she
put the Card's fate squarely in Doyle's hands.
On court six, Doyle became the real star of
the day for the Cardinal. Down 5-3 in the third
set as the two teams rested at a 3-3 tie, the
pressure was on for the No. 57-ranked fresh
man from San Francisco. With her teammates
cheering her on from the sidelines, Doyle
made a huge comeback against Cal's Maegan
Manasse to even the game at 6-6. From there,
Manasse did not have a chance, as Doyle

ripped through the tiebreaker without drop
ping a point, securing the match for Stanford.
"I'm just thrilled," Doyle said after the
match. "It was a very dramatic finish, but I'm
super pumped that we were able to get
through a very tough Cal team and moving
onto the quarters. Kind of a blur, but it's defi
nitely an amazing feeling."
The victory against Cal places Stanford
back at the top of the Pac-12, and the win will
certainly provide an invaluable confidence
boost if the Cardinal end up facing fifth-seeded
UCLA in the championship match.
"It just really shows how strong we are and
howready we are for NCAAs," Doyle said. "And
to be the higher seed especially, it shows that
we're here to play and we're not going any
where."

So far, at least, that assessment seems ac
curate, because history appears to be repeating
itself in Georgia. Almost exactly a year ago,
12th-seeded Stanford fought in a marathon
Round of 16 match against conference foe
USC to win 4-3. During the regular season last
year, the Cardinal had lost 6-1 to the Trojans.
Sound familiar?

That is because this year, the 1 lth-seeded
Cardinal also found themselves in the under
dog position coming into the Sweet 16, espe
cially after losing 6-1 to the Bears in the last
meeting between the two teams.
"Before the match, we talked a lot about
the symmetry of last year," Doyle acknowl
edged. "We talked a lot about that and how to
never give up. It's crazy, another dramatic fin
ish, but we definitely were prepared. We knew
that it wasn't a downfall, per se, that we lost to

them before. It definitely gave us extra motiva
tion to beat them."

The symmetry is especially apparent with
regards to Doyle's own clutch performance.
Doyle, who is the team's winningest player at
31-5, appears to be stepping into the role held
by current sophomore Krista Hardebeck last
season. In 2013, Hardebeck ultimately
clinched an NCAA title game berth for the Car
dinal after mounting a dramatic comeback in
the face of tremendous odds against Florida in
the semifinals. Thursday's thrilling showing
from Doyle, coupled with her solid Pac-12 Tour
nament play and her match-clinching win in
the round of 32, only strengthens the parallel
between the two players.
The Card will hope that Doyle continues
her dominance going forward, as Stanford
faces a strong opponent in third-seeded Vir
ginia in the quarterfinals. Virgina (24-5, 12-2
ACC) is coming off a 4-1 victory over No. 14
Baylor, and the perennial tennis powerhouse
will certainly present a challenge for the bur
geoning Cardinal.
"[We'll] just keep taking it one match at a
time," Doyle said. "We'll probably celebrate a
little, but we've got to keep moving on quickly,
not think about this match too much and keep
focusing on the brand new team we have ahead
of us and what we have to do to get to the next
round."

Stanford faces No. 3 Virginia at 9:00 a.m.
on Saturday with a spot in the Final Four on the
line.
