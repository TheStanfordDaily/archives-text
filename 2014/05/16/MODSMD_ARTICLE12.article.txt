# NCAA hopes in need of spark
## 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN DESK EDITOR 
Seven games remain, representing just
seven more chances for Stanford baseball to
leave its mark and make a last-ditch effort at
qualifying for the postseason.
The Cardinal (24-22, 11-13 Pac-12) sit
firmly on the NCAA Tournament bubble,
with some projecting the Card as one of the
first four teams left out of the tournament.
While Stanford's loss to San Jose State on
Tuesday dealt a severe blow to the team's
postseason aspirations, the Card are not nec
essarily out of the picture just yet.
By winning its final seven games
two three-game series against Washington
State and Utah, respectively, with a non
conference showdown against Pacific in
between Stanford could make a strong
case to the NCAA selection committee.
The Card's chances would also increase if
a team like Arizona State (27-21, 14-10)

faltered down the stretch.
However, at this point, the perform
ance of the Card's fellow bubble teams is a
secondary concern, as Stanford must get
hot in these final seven games to have any
real shot at playing for a trip to Omaha.
The potential for an abrupt ending to
a long campaign has not gone unnoticed in
the Cardinal dugout. As senior Brett
Michael Doran stated in an interview with
The Daily, "it's definitely a weird thing,
and it's hard to get a grasp of that." Stan
ford enters this crucial stretch on the out
side looking in, but it nevertheless has an
opportunity to make a run.
First things first, however Stan
ford must take care of business against a
streaky Washington State squad at Sunken
Diamond this weekend. The Cougars (22-
25, 12-12) currently sit one game ahead of
the Cardinal in the conference standings,
but have had a wildly inconsistent season,
most recently dropping a matchup with

Gonzaga on Tuesday.
Friday's probable starter for Washington
State is junior lefty Joe Pistorese (4-2), who
has started in 11 of the Cougars' contests
this season. Stanford will likely counter with
freshman righty Cal Quantrill (3-5). After
starting the season as the team's Friday night
pitcher, Quantrill moved down one spot in
the rotation before returning to the top spot
three weeks ago against Cal.
In the second leg of the series, Washing
ton State head coach Donnie Marbut will
likely hand the ball to senior left-hander
Jason Monda (2-5). Monda will almost cer
tainly have his work cut out for him on Satur
day, as he will go up against the freight train
that is junior leftyjohn Hochstatter (8-1).
One of the biggest storylines of Stan
ford's season, Hochstatter was used sparing
ly in the first half of the season, coming on in
relief on a handful of occasions. However, he

Junior third baseman Alex Blandino (above) has been the main source of power in the heart of Stanford's 2014 lineup. Blandino is hitting
.299 with a team-leading 9 home runs and a .517 slugging percentage. The 2014 preseason consensus All-American also has 29 RBIs.
has played a vital role in keeping Stanford's
postseason hopes alive after getting his first
start of the season on April 13 against Wash
ington. Since then, Hochstatter has not
looked back, winning that start in Seattle, as
well as all four of his subsequent appear
ances. Hochstatter's scorching 1.96 ERA is
fifth among pitchers in the Pac-12.
Stanford will likely keep the same rota
tion from last week by sending out sopho
more lefty Logan James (2-2) on Sunday. Al
though he has pitched predominantly out of
the bullpen this season, James looked very
strong in his third start of the season last
week against Arizona, giving up two runs
over seven innings of work. James will proba
bly go up against Washington State junior
righty Tanner Chleborad (3-6).
At the plate, Stanford will look to rely on
its most consistent hitters to keep the of
fense going during a crucial stretch of the
season. Junior third baseman Alex Blandino
has been the Card's main source of power,
leading the team with nine homers and a
.517 slugging percentage. Sophomore out
fielder Zach Hoffpauir has also delivered sev
eral big hits in the last couple weeks, and is
tied with Blandino for the second most hits
on the team behind junior center fielder
Austin Slater Slater's .345 batting aver
age ranks sixth in the Pac-12.
For Washington State, junior third base
man Nick Tanielu and junior outfielder Yale
Rosen, who typically hit back-to-back in the
WSU lineup, figure to present the largest
threat to Stanford's defense. Rosen was
named Pac-12 Conference Player of the Week
for March 31-April 6 after batting .700 in a
three-game series against Cal, while Tanielu
leads the Cougars with 27 RBIs and a .322
batting average.

The series between Stanford and Wash
ington State begins Friday evening at 7 p.m.,
with a fireworks show immediately following
the action. The two teams will return on Sat
urday and Sunday to face off at 1 p.m. and
noon, respectively. Following the series, Stan
ford will play for a fourth consecutive day and
take on Pacific at home on Monday at 5:30
p.m. The regular season will conclude the fol
lowing weekend with a three-game tilt in Salt
Lake City against Utah.

its most consistent hitters to keep the of
fense going during a crucial stretch of the
season. Junior third baseman Alex Blandino
has been the Card's main source of power,
leading the team with nine homers and a
.517 slugging percentage. Sophomore out
fielder Zach Hoffpauir has also delivered sev
eral big hits in the last couple weeks, and is
tied with Blandino for the second most hits
on the team behind junior center fielder
Austin Slater Slater's .345 batting aver
age ranks sixth in the Pac-12.
For Washington State, junior third base
man Nick Tanielu and junior outfielder Yale
Rosen, who typically hit back-to-back in the
WSU lineup, figure to present the largest
threat to Stanford's defense. Rosen was
named Pac-12 Conference Player of the Week
for March 31-April 6 after batting .700 in a
three-game series against Cal, while Tanielu
leads the Cougars with 27 RBIs and a .322
batting average.

The series between Stanford and Wash
ington State begins Friday evening at 7 p.m.,
with a fireworks show immediately following
the action. The two teams will return on Sat
urday and Sunday to face off at 1 p.m. and
noon, respectively. Following the series, Stan
ford will play for a fourth consecutive day and
take on Pacific at home on Monday at 5:30
p.m. The regular season will conclude the fol
lowing weekend with a three-game tilt in Salt
Lake City against Utah.

Seven games remain, representing just
seven more chances for Stanford baseball to
leave its mark and make a last-ditch effort at
qualifying for the postseason.
The Cardinal (24-22, 11-13 Pac-12) sit
firmly on the NCAA Tournament bubble,
with some projecting the Card as one of the
first four teams left out of the tournament.
While Stanford's loss to San Jose State on
Tuesday dealt a severe blow to the team's
postseason aspirations, the Card are not nec
essarily out of the picture just yet.
By winning its final seven games
two three-game series against Washington
State and Utah, respectively, with a non
conference showdown against Pacific in
between Stanford could make a strong
case to the NCAA selection committee.
The Card's chances would also increase if
a team like Arizona State (27-21, 14-10)

faltered down the stretch.
However, at this point, the perform
ance of the Card's fellow bubble teams is a
secondary concern, as Stanford must get
hot in these final seven games to have any
real shot at playing for a trip to Omaha.
The potential for an abrupt ending to
a long campaign has not gone unnoticed in
the Cardinal dugout. As senior Brett
Michael Doran stated in an interview with
The Daily, "it's definitely a weird thing,
and it's hard to get a grasp of that." Stan
ford enters this crucial stretch on the out
side looking in, but it nevertheless has an
opportunity to make a run.
First things first, however Stan
ford must take care of business against a
streaky Washington State squad at Sunken
Diamond this weekend. The Cougars (22-
25, 12-12) currently sit one game ahead of
the Cardinal in the conference standings,
but have had a wildly inconsistent season,
most recently dropping a matchup with

Gonzaga on Tuesday.
Friday's probable starter for Washington
State is junior lefty Joe Pistorese (4-2), who
has started in 11 of the Cougars' contests
this season. Stanford will likely counter with
freshman righty Cal Quantrill (3-5). After
starting the season as the team's Friday night
pitcher, Quantrill moved down one spot in
the rotation before returning to the top spot
three weeks ago against Cal.
In the second leg of the series, Washing
ton State head coach Donnie Marbut will
likely hand the ball to senior left-hander
Jason Monda (2-5). Monda will almost cer
tainly have his work cut out for him on Satur
day, as he will go up against the freight train
that is junior leftyjohn Hochstatter (8-1).
One of the biggest storylines of Stan
ford's season, Hochstatter was used sparing
ly in the first half of the season, coming on in
relief on a handful of occasions. However, he

has played a vital role in keeping Stanford's
postseason hopes alive after getting his first
start of the season on April 13 against Wash
ington. Since then, Hochstatter has not
looked back, winning that start in Seattle, as
well as all four of his subsequent appear
ances. Hochstatter's scorching 1.96 ERA is
fifth among pitchers in the Pac-12.
Stanford will likely keep the same rota
tion from last week by sending out sopho
more lefty Logan James (2-2) on Sunday. Al
though he has pitched predominantly out of
the bullpen this season, James looked very
strong in his third start of the season last
week against Arizona, giving up two runs
over seven innings of work. James will proba
bly go up against Washington State junior
righty Tanner Chleborad (3-6).
