# NCAA hopes in need of spark

### VIHAN LAKSHMAN DESK EDITOR 
Seven games remain, representing just
seven more chances for Stanford baseball to
leave its mark and make a last-ditch effort at
qualifying for the postseason.
The Cardinal (24-22, 11-13 Pac-12) sit
firmly on the NCAA Tournament bubble,
with some projecting the Card as one of the
first four teams left out of the tournament.
While Stanford's loss to San Jose State on
Tuesday dealt a severe blow to the team's
postseason aspirations, the Card are not nec
essarily out of the picture just yet.
By winning its final seven games
two three-game series against Washington
State and Utah, respectively, with a non
conference showdown against Pacific in
between Stanford could make a strong
case to the NCAA selection committee.
The Card's chances would also increase if
a team like Arizona State (27-21, 14-10)

faltered down the stretch.
However, at this point, the perform
ance of the Card's fellow bubble teams is a
secondary concern, as Stanford must get
hot in these final seven games to have any
real shot at playing for a trip to Omaha.
The potential for an abrupt ending to
a long campaign has not gone unnoticed in
the Cardinal dugout. As senior Brett
Michael Doran stated in an interview with
The Daily, "it's definitely a weird thing,
and it's hard to get a grasp of that." Stan
ford enters this crucial stretch on the out
side looking in, but it nevertheless has an
opportunity to make a run.
First things first, however Stan
ford must take care of business against a
streaky Washington State squad at Sunken
Diamond this weekend. The Cougars (22-
25, 12-12) currently sit one game ahead of
the Cardinal in the conference standings,
but have had a wildly inconsistent season,
most recently dropping a matchup with

Gonzaga on Tuesday.
Friday's probable starter for Washington
State is junior lefty Joe Pistorese (4-2), who
has started in 11 of the Cougars' contests
this season. Stanford will likely counter with
freshman righty Cal Quantrill (3-5). After
starting the season as the team's Friday night
pitcher, Quantrill moved down one spot in
the rotation before returning to the top spot
three weeks ago against Cal.
In the second leg of the series, Washing
ton State head coach Donnie Marbut will
likely hand the ball to senior left-hander
Jason Monda (2-5). Monda will almost cer
tainly have his work cut out for him on Satur
day, as he will go up against the freight train
that is junior leftyjohn Hochstatter (8-1).
One of the biggest storylines of Stan
ford's season, Hochstatter was used sparing
ly in the first half of the season, coming on in
relief on a handful of occasions. However, he

Junior third baseman Alex Blandino (above) has been the main source of power in the heart of Stanford's 2014 lineup. Blandino is hitting
.299 with a team-leading 9 home runs and a .517 slugging percentage. The 2014 preseason consensus All-American also has 29 RBIs.
