# TRACK AND FIELD
## Track moves to Pac-12s 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
After another long year of competing and
training during the cross country, indoor and
outdoor seasons, the end is in sight for Stan
ford track and field team as it enters the final
championship meet stretch of the 2013-2014
season. The Cardinal will travel to Pullman,
Washington, this weekend for the outdoor
Pac-12 Championships, and although team
conference championships for the men and
women are unlikely, Stanford will be in a good
position to qualify its athletes for the upcom
ing NCAA Prelims. Several athletes will also
be in contention for individual conference
championships.

Stanford's women have notched individ
ual conference championships each of the last
17 seasons marking a conference high

and will be looking to extend that streak with
the talented entrants that they bring to the
table this weekend.

Leading the charge will be junior Aisling
Cuffe, who will likely be an overwhelming fa
vorite to take home the conference title in the
5,000 meters, as she has only gotten better in
the event as the year has progressed. A series
of standout showings from Cuffe culminated
in an eye-popping performance at the Payton
Jordan Invitational two weekends ago, when
she ran a 15:11.13 to become the third
fastest collegian in history. Thus, she will al
most certainly improve on her sixth-place per
formance and 16:3 7.12 in the event last year,
and Cuffe is a lock to qualify for nationals. Fi
nally, Cuffe figures to have a big impact in the
1,500 as well.

Senior Jessica Tonn will also be counted
on to contribute a stellar performance in the
5,000, which is expected to be one of the Car
dinal's strongest events this weekend. Tonn
finished fifth individually at the conference
championships in the event last season with
