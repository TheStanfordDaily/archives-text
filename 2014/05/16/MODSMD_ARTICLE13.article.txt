# TRACK AND FIELD
## Track moves to Pac-12s 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
After another long year of competing and
training during the cross country, indoor and
outdoor seasons, the end is in sight for Stan
ford track and field team as it enters the final
championship meet stretch of the 2013-2014
season. The Cardinal will travel to Pullman,
Washington, this weekend for the outdoor
Pac-12 Championships, and although team
conference championships for the men and
women are unlikely, Stanford will be in a good
position to qualify its athletes for the upcom
ing NCAA Prelims. Several athletes will also
be in contention for individual conference
championships.

Stanford's women have notched individ
ual conference championships each of the last
17 seasons marking a conference high

and will be looking to extend that streak with
the talented entrants that they bring to the
table this weekend.

Leading the charge will be junior Aisling
Cuffe, who will likely be an overwhelming fa
vorite to take home the conference title in the
5,000 meters, as she has only gotten better in
the event as the year has progressed. A series
of standout showings from Cuffe culminated
in an eye-popping performance at the Payton
Jordan Invitational two weekends ago, when
she ran a 15:11.13 to become the third
fastest collegian in history. Thus, she will al
most certainly improve on her sixth-place per
formance and 16:3 7.12 in the event last year,
and Cuffe is a lock to qualify for nationals. Fi
nally, Cuffe figures to have a big impact in the
1,500 as well.

Senior Jessica Tonn will also be counted
on to contribute a stellar performance in the
5,000, which is expected to be one of the Car
dinal's strongest events this weekend. Tonn
finished fifth individually at the conference
championships in the event last season with
her 15:54.90, and the talented dis
tance runner will also make an im
pact in the 10,000 if she runs in
that event as well.
Another event in which Stan
ford looks to be in good shape is the
women's 800, which features the
dynamic duo of sophomores Amy
Weissenbach and Claudia Saun
ders. Weissenbach finished sixth in
the 800 at NCAAs as a freshman
last season and is second on Stan
ford's all-time list in the 800, be
hind just Justine Fedronic. She is al
ways a threat to improve on that
time and will look to do so this
weekend. Saunders is also not far
behind Weissenbach and will look
to qualify for the Pac-12 finals
and beyond after barely missing
out on the Pac-12 finals cut last sea
son.
Stanford's chances in the
sprints took a significant hit when
sophomores Kaitlyn Williams and
Kristyn Williams both had to drop
out of the field due to injuries.
Kristyn Williams has rapidly
emerged as one of the premier
sprinting threats in the country,
while setting multiple school and
personal records in the 400 since
her arrival on the Farm last year.
The loss of the sisters will also mean
that Stanford's chances of having an
impact in the 4x400 relay will take
a hit as well.
In the field events, junior Bri
anna Bain will be one of the fa
vorites to win in the javelin, while
freshman Valerie Allman will look to
continue to build on an outstanding
freshman campaign.
For the men, there is nowhere
to go but up after their last-place fin
ish as a team in last year's confer
ence championships. While a team
title is almost certainly out of the
question, however, many of the in
dividuals on the team are primed to
have fantastic races to qualify for
the upcoming NCAAs.
Sophomore Steven Solomon
will be one of the favorites in the
400, but will likely qualify for the

Sophomore Steven Solomon (above), a 2012 Olympic finalist and the defending Australian national champion in
the 400 meters, will be one of the favorites in that event at the Pac-12 Championships in Pullman this weekend.
