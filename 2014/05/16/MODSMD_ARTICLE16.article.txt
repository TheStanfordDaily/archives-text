# 2014 softball season recap
## 
### David Cohn 
How do you define success in life? Is
it measured by getting A's in every
class, or by winning conference and
national championships in athlet
ics? Our society as a whole largely
holds this viewpoint, as winners and champi
ons are consistently elevated to a rarefied sta
tus; their achievements are often the only fac
tor we use in order to judge their contributions
to our culture.

On the other hand, could success be de
fined as making the best of the hand one has
been dealt in life? More specifically, can we
look as favorably upon someone or a particular
team that, due to life's circumstances, was un
able to reach that championship or winning
plateau?

While I believe that there are certainly no
right or wrong answers to any of these ques
tions, your idea of success will certainly dictate
your opinion of the 2014 Stanford Softball sea
son. By the first metric, Stanford Softball's (30-
25, 5-19 Pac-12) 2014 campaign was a shock
ing letdown, as the Cardinal failed to win a Pac
-12 series in conference play for the first time
since 1995. The Card also missed the postsea
son for the first time since 1997, ending a 16-
year run of consistency in reaching the NCAA
Tournament.

However, I believe that this characteriza
tion of Stanford's season is unfair and incom
plete, as the Cardinal's campaign was also
marked by extreme adversity, namely with the
loss of three-quarters of the Card's pitching ro
tation by the second week of the season. While
there is nothing that I can say to ease the pain
and disappointment that every member of the
softball team must be feeling at this present
moment, the players of the 2014 softball team
embodied the qualities of resiliency and deter
mination with their play and attitude this year.

After the loss of No. 1 high school re
cruit and future star pitcher Carley Hoover
to an upper-body injury that would ultimate
ly end her season after only eight games, as

well as the loss of junior Nyree White to a
medical leave, the Cardinal could have easily
given up on the season. Instead, the Card
roared out of the gate, jumping out to the
second-best start to a season in school histo
ry at 13-0.

As a result, Stanford's rotation, led by a
freshman pitcher in Madi Schreyer who con
sistently displayed a maturity well beyond
her years, would ultimately have to be held

together for the rest of season by posi-

tion players, as designated player Tylyn

Wells and shortstop Kylie Sorenson be-

came the second and third options in

the circle for the Cardinal. Nevertheless,
while Schreyer, Wells and Sorenson worked
to keep the rotation afloat, the Cardinal of
fense would often have to out-slug its com
petition in order to win. When the Card fell
behind by five runs to Cal in the seventh in
ning of the Cardinal's Pac-12 opener, Stan
ford mounted a furious comeback with six
runs in the bottom of the seventh to stun the
Bears 14-13. In turn, after nine consecutive
Pac-12 losses, including tough 16-15, 7-5,
and 18-12 setbacks to Arizona State and Ari
zona, respectively, the Cardinal kept fighting
and swinging away, culminating in a 13-5
rout of then-No. 10 Washington.
This response to adversity became a re
curring theme for the Card during Pac-12

conference play, as Stanford would maintain
its postseason candidacy until the final week
of the regular season with a series of clutch
performances. After a sweep at the hands of
No. 1 Oregon at home, the Cardinal traveled
to Los Angeles and stunned No. 2 UCLA by a
score of 12-9 for the Card's first road win
against a top-five squad since 2011.
Furthermore, Stanford pulled another
huge comeback against Utah to avoid a
sweep that likely would have ended the
Card's postseason hopes in mid-April; the

Cardinal came back from a 10-3 deficit at the
start of the sixth inning to shock the Utes 12-
11 in the final game of the three game set.
In the end, despite all of the trials and
tribulations of this 2014 season, the Card
still entered the last weekend of the season
as one of ESPNW's "Last 5 Teams In the
NCAA Tournament" with an RPI of 41 and
an opportunity to lock up an at-large berth
in the postseason with a sweep of Pac-12

Winners are elevated to
a rarefied status in our
society, as their titles are
often the sole factor in
judging their impact.

in several offensive categories this season, including batting average, walks and slugging
percentage, earning second team All-Pac-12 honors for her numerous contributions.
bottom dweller Oregon State.
However, the injuries in the circle
proved to be too much to over
come, as the Cardinal suffered a
home series loss to the Beavers
before being left out of the NCAA
Tournament field on Sunday.

As the play-by-play announcer
for Stanford softball on KZSU-Stan
ford, I had the opportunity to travel
with the team to Tucson, Arizona
for its series against the Arizona
Wildcats. Although the Cardinal
were swept by the Wildcats that
weekend, every single player on
the team never let the previous
day's setbacks, or any frustrations
over losing, affect their demeanors
or play in the following game.
That weekend, I sawNFCAand
Pac-12 Freshman of the Year candi
date Kylie Sorenson, who I un
doubtedly believe will go down as
one of the great players in program
history when her Cardinal career is
over, pick herself up after giving up
12 runs in the circle to the potent
Wildcat offense by hitting .444 in
the series with 6 RBIs. I saw fresh
man Madi Schreyer bounce back
from a tough start in an 18-12 Friday
loss to the Cats by largely stifling the
Zona offense in the series finale.
I saw freshman Bessie Noll re
cover from three strikeouts earlier
in the three-game set, including
once with the bases loaded, to hit
as clutch of a home run as you will
see, breaking a 2-2 tie in Sunday's
game in the top of the seventh in
ning with a blast to straightaway
center field. Finally, I saw junior
Erin Ashby persevere after getting
hit very hard on the hand by an er
rant pitch to reach base safely in
her final two at-bats of the day.
Quite simply, the tenacity and
heart of the softball team that
weekend was inspiring, making me
proud to have had the opportunity
to cover the team this season.

At the end of the day, the lega
cy of the 2014 softball team in the

minds of Stanford softball fans will
depend on their definitions of suc
cess. Although I may not convince
other Cardinal supporters of my
point of view, I will neverview this
2014 squad as "The Team That
Missed the NCAA Tournament."

Instead, I will always remember
this team for handling an incredible
amount of adversity to the absolute
best of its ability. Furthermore, the
players' sheer refusal to quit or
throw in the towel is indicative of

this team's immense character and
heart, something that I will always
value more than winning. Ultimate
ly, I believe that the memories of
wins and losses from this season will
eventually fade, but the memories
of the 2014 softball team's heart
and effort will always remain as ex
amples to future Stanford student
athletes and softball players.

Junior Leah White (above) had another standout season, hitting .356 with
14 extra-base hits and 38 RBIs and earning second team All-Pac-12 honors
for the second time in three seasons. White also posted 16 stolen bases in
2014 as part of a prolific offense that set numerous school records.

Junior Leah White (above) had another standout season, hitting .356 with
14 extra-base hits and 38 RBIs and earning second team All-Pac-12 honors
for the second time in three seasons. White also posted 16 stolen bases in
2014 as part of a prolific offense that set numerous school records.
How do you define success in life? Is
it measured by getting A's in every
class, or by winning conference and
national championships in athlet
ics? Our society as a whole largely
holds this viewpoint, as winners and champi
ons are consistently elevated to a rarefied sta
tus; their achievements are often the only fac
tor we use in order to judge their contributions
to our culture.

On the other hand, could success be de
fined as making the best of the hand one has
been dealt in life? More specifically, can we
look as favorably upon someone or a particular
team that, due to life's circumstances, was un
able to reach that championship or winning
plateau?

While I believe that there are certainly no
right or wrong answers to any of these ques
tions, your idea of success will certainly dictate
your opinion of the 2014 Stanford Softball sea
son. By the first metric, Stanford Softball's (30-
25, 5-19 Pac-12) 2014 campaign was a shock
ing letdown, as the Cardinal failed to win a Pac
-12 series in conference play for the first time
since 1995. The Card also missed the postsea
son for the first time since 1997, ending a 16-
year run of consistency in reaching the NCAA
Tournament.

However, I believe that this characteriza
tion of Stanford's season is unfair and incom
plete, as the Cardinal's campaign was also
marked by extreme adversity, namely with the
loss of three-quarters of the Card's pitching ro
tation by the second week of the season. While
there is nothing that I can say to ease the pain
and disappointment that every member of the
softball team must be feeling at this present
moment, the players of the 2014 softball team
embodied the qualities of resiliency and deter
mination with their play and attitude this year.

After the loss of No. 1 high school re
cruit and future star pitcher Carley Hoover
to an upper-body injury that would ultimate
ly end her season after only eight games, as

well as the loss of junior Nyree White to a
medical leave, the Cardinal could have easily
given up on the season. Instead, the Card
roared out of the gate, jumping out to the
second-best start to a season in school histo
ry at 13-0.

As a result, Stanford's rotation, led by a
freshman pitcher in Madi Schreyer who con
sistently displayed a maturity well beyond
her years, would ultimately have to be held

together for the rest of season by posi-

tion players, as designated player Tylyn

Wells and shortstop Kylie Sorenson be-

came the second and third options in

the circle for the Cardinal. Nevertheless,
while Schreyer, Wells and Sorenson worked
to keep the rotation afloat, the Cardinal of
fense would often have to out-slug its com
petition in order to win. When the Card fell
behind by five runs to Cal in the seventh in
ning of the Cardinal's Pac-12 opener, Stan
ford mounted a furious comeback with six
runs in the bottom of the seventh to stun the
Bears 14-13. In turn, after nine consecutive
Pac-12 losses, including tough 16-15, 7-5,
and 18-12 setbacks to Arizona State and Ari
zona, respectively, the Cardinal kept fighting
and swinging away, culminating in a 13-5
rout of then-No. 10 Washington.
This response to adversity became a re
curring theme for the Card during Pac-12

conference play, as Stanford would maintain
its postseason candidacy until the final week
of the regular season with a series of clutch
performances. After a sweep at the hands of
No. 1 Oregon at home, the Cardinal traveled
to Los Angeles and stunned No. 2 UCLA by a
score of 12-9 for the Card's first road win
against a top-five squad since 2011.
Furthermore, Stanford pulled another
huge comeback against Utah to avoid a
sweep that likely would have ended the
Card's postseason hopes in mid-April; the

Cardinal came back from a 10-3 deficit at the
start of the sixth inning to shock the Utes 12-
11 in the final game of the three game set.
In the end, despite all of the trials and
tribulations of this 2014 season, the Card
still entered the last weekend of the season
as one of ESPNW's "Last 5 Teams In the
NCAA Tournament" with an RPI of 41 and
an opportunity to lock up an at-large berth
in the postseason with a sweep of Pac-12

However, the injuries in the circle
proved to be too much to over
come, as the Cardinal suffered a
home series loss to the Beavers
before being left out of the NCAA
Tournament field on Sunday.

As the play-by-play announcer
for Stanford softball on KZSU-Stan
ford, I had the opportunity to travel
with the team to Tucson, Arizona
for its series against the Arizona
Wildcats. Although the Cardinal
were swept by the Wildcats that
weekend, every single player on
the team never let the previous
day's setbacks, or any frustrations
over losing, affect their demeanors
or play in the following game.
That weekend, I sawNFCAand
Pac-12 Freshman of the Year candi
date Kylie Sorenson, who I un
doubtedly believe will go down as
one of the great players in program
history when her Cardinal career is
over, pick herself up after giving up
12 runs in the circle to the potent
Wildcat offense by hitting .444 in
the series with 6 RBIs. I saw fresh
man Madi Schreyer bounce back
from a tough start in an 18-12 Friday
loss to the Cats by largely stifling the
Zona offense in the series finale.
I saw freshman Bessie Noll re
cover from three strikeouts earlier
in the three-game set, including
once with the bases loaded, to hit
as clutch of a home run as you will
see, breaking a 2-2 tie in Sunday's
game in the top of the seventh in
ning with a blast to straightaway
center field. Finally, I saw junior
Erin Ashby persevere after getting
hit very hard on the hand by an er
rant pitch to reach base safely in
her final two at-bats of the day.
Quite simply, the tenacity and
heart of the softball team that
weekend was inspiring, making me
proud to have had the opportunity
to cover the team this season.

as clutch of a home run as you will
see, breaking a 2-2 tie in Sunday's
game in the top of the seventh in
ning with a blast to straightaway
center field. Finally, I saw junior
Erin Ashby persevere after getting
hit very hard on the hand by an er
rant pitch to reach base safely in
her final two at-bats of the day.
Quite simply, the tenacity and
heart of the softball team that
weekend was inspiring, making me
proud to have had the opportunity
to cover the team this season.

At the end of the day, the lega
cy of the 2014 softball team in the

minds of Stanford softball fans will
depend on their definitions of suc
cess. Although I may not convince
other Cardinal supporters of my
point of view, I will neverview this
2014 squad as "The Team That
Missed the NCAA Tournament."

Instead, I will always remember
this team for handling an incredible
amount of adversity to the absolute
best of its ability. Furthermore, the
players' sheer refusal to quit or
throw in the towel is indicative of

this team's immense character and
heart, something that I will always
value more than winning. Ultimate
ly, I believe that the memories of
wins and losses from this season will
eventually fade, but the memories
of the 2014 softball team's heart
and effort will always remain as ex
amples to future Stanford student
athletes and softball players.
