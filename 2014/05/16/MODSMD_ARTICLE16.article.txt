# 2014 softball season recap

### David Cohn 
How do you define success in life? Is
it measured by getting A's in every
class, or by winning conference and
national championships in athlet
ics? Our society as a whole largely
holds this viewpoint, as winners and champi
ons are consistently elevated to a rarefied sta
tus; their achievements are often the only fac
tor we use in order to judge their contributions
to our culture.

On the other hand, could success be de
fined as making the best of the hand one has
been dealt in life? More specifically, can we
look as favorably upon someone or a particular
team that, due to life's circumstances, was un
able to reach that championship or winning
plateau?

While I believe that there are certainly no
right or wrong answers to any of these ques
tions, your idea of success will certainly dictate
your opinion of the 2014 Stanford Softball sea
son. By the first metric, Stanford Softball's (30-
25, 5-19 Pac-12) 2014 campaign was a shock
ing letdown, as the Cardinal failed to win a Pac
-12 series in conference play for the first time
since 1995. The Card also missed the postsea
son for the first time since 1997, ending a 16-
year run of consistency in reaching the NCAA
Tournament.

However, I believe that this characteriza
tion of Stanford's season is unfair and incom
plete, as the Cardinal's campaign was also
marked by extreme adversity, namely with the
loss of three-quarters of the Card's pitching ro
tation by the second week of the season. While
there is nothing that I can say to ease the pain
and disappointment that every member of the
softball team must be feeling at this present
moment, the players of the 2014 softball team
embodied the qualities of resiliency and deter
mination with their play and attitude this year.

After the loss of No. 1 high school re
cruit and future star pitcher Carley Hoover
to an upper-body injury that would ultimate
ly end her season after only eight games, as

well as the loss of junior Nyree White to a
medical leave, the Cardinal could have easily
given up on the season. Instead, the Card
roared out of the gate, jumping out to the
second-best start to a season in school histo
ry at 13-0.

As a result, Stanford's rotation, led by a
freshman pitcher in Madi Schreyer who con
sistently displayed a maturity well beyond
her years, would ultimately have to be held

together for the rest of season by posi-

tion players, as designated player Tylyn

Wells and shortstop Kylie Sorenson be-

came the second and third options in

the circle for the Cardinal. Nevertheless,
while Schreyer, Wells and Sorenson worked
to keep the rotation afloat, the Cardinal of
fense would often have to out-slug its com
petition in order to win. When the Card fell
behind by five runs to Cal in the seventh in
ning of the Cardinal's Pac-12 opener, Stan
ford mounted a furious comeback with six
runs in the bottom of the seventh to stun the
Bears 14-13. In turn, after nine consecutive
Pac-12 losses, including tough 16-15, 7-5,
and 18-12 setbacks to Arizona State and Ari
zona, respectively, the Cardinal kept fighting
and swinging away, culminating in a 13-5
rout of then-No. 10 Washington.
This response to adversity became a re
curring theme for the Card during Pac-12

conference play, as Stanford would maintain
its postseason candidacy until the final week
of the regular season with a series of clutch
performances. After a sweep at the hands of
No. 1 Oregon at home, the Cardinal traveled
to Los Angeles and stunned No. 2 UCLA by a
score of 12-9 for the Card's first road win
against a top-five squad since 2011.
Furthermore, Stanford pulled another
huge comeback against Utah to avoid a
sweep that likely would have ended the
Card's postseason hopes in mid-April; the

Cardinal came back from a 10-3 deficit at the
start of the sixth inning to shock the Utes 12-
11 in the final game of the three game set.
In the end, despite all of the trials and
tribulations of this 2014 season, the Card
still entered the last weekend of the season
as one of ESPNW's "Last 5 Teams In the
NCAA Tournament" with an RPI of 41 and
an opportunity to lock up an at-large berth
in the postseason with a sweep of Pac-12

Winners are elevated to
a rarefied status in our
society, as their titles are
often the sole factor in
judging their impact.

Freshman Kylie Sorenson (above) shined in her first campaign on the Farm. She led Stanford
in several offensive categories this season, including batting average, walks and slugging
percentage, earning second team All-Pac-12 honors for her numerous contributions.
