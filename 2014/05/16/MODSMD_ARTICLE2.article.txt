## Evolution of Frost A 						look back at the festival's birth, death and revival

Joan Baez. The Grateful Dead. Cree
dence Clearwater Revival. Eric Clapton.
These are just a few names that have per
formed at Stanford's Frost Amphitheater.
But Frost has not consistently hosted
greats like these throughout its existence
indeed, the venue has had quite the
roller coaster of a history.
Before the era of rock 'n' roll, Frost

was simply an event venue for speakers
and commencement was often held in its
grassy arena. Occasional jazz and classical
musicians would play there.
However, beginning in the late 19605,
Frost Amphitheater, situated between the
Main Quad and Stanford Stadium, became
the grassy stomping grounds for some of
the biggest acts of the rock 'n' roll era.
In the fall of 1972, reports of robbery,
violence and extreme drug and alcohol
abuse during these events led the Univer

sity to ban on all concerts on campus. Not
one amplifier was heard until an ASSU af
filiate organization (now-defunct) called
Special Events re-emerged in the mid
1970s and revived the concert scene.

Special Events was an entirely stu
dent-run organization, and while it shared
many similarities to Stanford Concert Net
work (SCN), the University's current stu
dent-run concert promotion organization,

Special Events had some particular
ly special qualities.
The group was responsible for
booking all concerts on campus and
organizing with different venues to
bring the most popular bands to the
student body. Although the group
was run by undergraduate students,
it operated on an entirely profes
sional level.

"People from all over the Bay
Area came," said Lenny Lieberman
'BO, one of the student organizers of
Special Events. "You would not dis
tinguish between a Stanford concert
and a concert anywhere else."
According to Lieberman, the
group would call ICM and William
Morris, two prominent talent agen
cies, on a daily basis. One of the core
directors of Special Events, Marc
Curtis '7B, recalled the concert pro
motion group was a full-time job.
"In the 16 months I ran special
events, I was there 9-to-5, Monday
through Friday," he said.
Local artists like Baez often pre
ferred to play at Stanford, according to
Lieberman, as the student culture of
tentimes made for a better audience.

The group spent around
$lO,OOO per headlining act, occa
sionally more for really big names.
During Curtis' tenure, the group
paid Frank Zappa $25,000. The stu
dents who ran Special Events, were,
according to lieberman, a very en
trepreneurial and driven group of

people. Many of them went on to
work in the concert promotion busi
ness Daniel Scher '73 MBA '75,
one of the core organizers, worked
for Bay Area rock concert promoter
Bill Graham after graduation; and
Brian Becker '79, another leading
force in Special Events, is now the
chair and chief executive officer of
Clear Channel Entertainment.
"You have to have students who
are really committed," Curtis said.
"If you look at students who were in
volved in Special Events, many of
them went on to be very successful
in the entertainment business."
Lieberman described the con
certs as "high risk, high reward."
Some years the group turned a prof
it, other years it lost.

"We did a kind of cost-benefit
analysis," Curtis said. "If you lost
$5,000, that was okay."
That all ended in 1980, when
the ASSU finally decided the finan
cial risk was too great for the school
"We probably overspent to get
acts from Bill Graham," Lieberman
admitted and they pulled the
plug on Special Events.
Since the deterioration of Spe
cial Events, there have been a num
ber of attempts some successful,
some not to revive a rich concert
scene on campus. On Sept. 1 just
one year later, Public Services
merged with the Office of Public
Events to become University Events

and Services, which hired full-time
professionals to collaborate with
ASSU organizations to bring con
certs to the Farm. Fearful of finan

cial mismanagement, the University
also created The Committee on
Contemporary Entertainment to re
view all concert proposals. When
the University instated a moratori
um banning all concerts on campus
shortly thereafter, University Events
and Services came to an end as well.

Finally, the creation of the cur
rent SCN in 1984 ended the two
year ban and injected life back into
the campus music scene. Since
then, SCN has put on a large num
ber of shows every year and has
even brought the Grateful Dead
back to campus.
In 2012, SCN decided to pay
homage to the Special Events era,
when the Stanford concerts were at
their zenith, by planning a Frost Re
vival Concert. Two-day music festival
in the Spring brought in headliner
Modest Mouse.
"We decided that Frost would

be a representation of Stanford rock
ing in the 705," said Alberto Aroeste
'l3, one of the organizers of Frost Re
vival in 2012 and former SCN direc
tor. Even the poster artworkwas out
fitted to look like a psychedelic bub
ble-lettered poster of the rock era.

This weekend will commence
the third Frost Arts and Music Festi
val, showcasing visual art alongside
the concert. Flowever, with more
oversight from the ASSU than Spe
cial Events ever had, SCN struggles
with its relatively small budget.
"Bands cost so much money,"
said Frances Ball' 15, the president of
SCN.

Despite this, in future years, SCN
hopes to be able to bring larger names
to campus to regain the eminence that
Stanford festivals once had.

The Grateful Dead were one of many big name bands that performed at Frost Music Festival during the 1970s and
1980s, along with Eric Clapton, Phish and more. The Special Events student group operated under looser guidelines
in obtaining artists than the current budgetary restrictions placed on the Stanford Concert Network (SCN).
