greats like these throughout its existence
indeed, the venue has had quite the
roller coaster of a history.
Before the era of rock 'n' roll, Frost

was simply an event venue for speakers
and commencement was often held in its
grassy arena. Occasional jazz and classical
musicians would play there.

Frost Amphitheater, situated between the
Main Quad and Stanford Stadium, became
the grassy stomping grounds for some of
the biggest acts of the rock 'n' roll era.
In the fall of 1972, reports of robbery,
violence and extreme drug and alcohol
abuse during these events led the Univer

sity to ban on all concerts on campus. Not
one amplifier was heard until an ASSU af

Special Events re-emerged in the mid
1970s and revived the concert scene.

Special Events was an entirely stu
dent-run organization, and while it shared

work (SCN), the University's current stu
dent-run concert promotion organization,
