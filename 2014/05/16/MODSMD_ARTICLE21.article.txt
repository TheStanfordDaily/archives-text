## FILM Coppola discusses her film "Palo Alto" 
### MADELEINE HAN DESK EDITOR 
Palo Alto is a suburban commu
nity that neighbors Stanford Univer
sity, the title of James Franco's short
story series about his hometown
and the fictional site of Gia Coppo
la's "Palo Alto," a film based on Fran
co's stories released on May 9.
Coppola's film, "Palo Alto," fol
lows the lives of Teddy (Jack Kilmer),
Fred (Nat Wolff) and April (Emma
Roberts), three teenagers riding the
ups and downs of suburban adoles
cence. Their trials and tribulations
range from illicit affairs with soccer
coaches (James Franco), to looking
for love in the wrong places, to driv
ing down neighborhood streets
searching for nothing but something
to do. The result is a dreamy yet
shrewd depiction of the emotional
depth that brews beneath the mun
dane day-to-day of suburban
teenage life.
The Stanford Daily talked with
Coppola about working with differ
ent artistic media, her teenage years
and the making of her first feature
length film.

The Stanford Daily (TSD):
What about the stories resonated
with you?

Gia Coppola (GC): I felt they
were really realistic about what it's
like to be a teenager, and I hadn't
seen that in a long time, and I was re

ally excited for the opportunity.

TSD: Many of the actors were
around the age of the characters in
the stories and then there was Fran
co, who wrote the stories. What was
it like working with young actors
and the author who wrote the con
tent you tried to portray?
GC: It was fun working with
the young actors. They were of the
age of their characters so they were
naturally doing the things that need
ed to be shown in the film. It was
just kind of right. With James, it was
nice for me to have him around be
cause I was a first-time director, and
I was excited to work with him. He's
a great actor. He knows the inspira
tion [for] those characters, and I
could really trust him to do what was
right. That's a really hard character
to play, because it could easily be
over the top, but he was natural, and
by him being natural [it] was creepy
enough just because what he's
doing is creepy.

TSD: Do you think the film
adds anything different to the con
tent that wasn't in the book?

GC: Because they're short sto
ries, [the film] was more about cap
turing the essence. I had to combine
certain characters and only use
maybe four or five stories and get
that tone and mood from them.
