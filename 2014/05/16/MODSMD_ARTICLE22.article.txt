# GRACE OF
## MONACO OLIVIER DAHAN'S FILM STARTS CANNES ON A MEDIOCRE NOTE 
### ALEXANDRA HEENEY MANAGING EDITOR 
What better way to inaugurate
the very exclusive 67th Cannes
Film Festival than with "Grace of
Monaco," a film that fails so spectac
ularly you wonder what it's even
doing on the program? Then again,
this is the festival that rewarded the
unwatchable "Uncle Boonmee Who
Can Recall His Past Lives" with its
top prize, the Palme d'Or, not too
long ago.

At about the 30-minute mark
in the second press screening of the
film, there was a sudden eruption of
laughter from the audience, no
longer able to contain its mockery:
Director Olivier Dahan was aimless
ly aiming his shaky camera at a long

close-up of Grace's (Nicole Kidman)
eyes, as she bemoans what a sad lot
it is to be the Princess of a silly na
tion.

Everything about this melodra
ma screams 'B' movie, but it makes
the mistake of taking itself seriously,
as if this could possibly be high art,
rather than relishing in its own pre
posterousness. From the mustache
twirling Royal familyâ€”the Prince
(Tim Roth) is always smoking a ciga
rette to the uptight royal assis
tant (Parker Posey) to the fact that it
asks us to take seriously both Mon
egasque politics and whether
Princess Grace had the right to cut
her hair short. Perhaps Dahan was
too focused on finding away to
make the very tall Kidman not look
like she's completely towering over

the very small Roth.
When the film begins, Princess
Grace is moping about how her
royal status prevents her from being
herself. Mr Hitchock pays a visit to
the palace to tempt her back into
the movies, and she seriously con
siders it. But when she realizes it's
her duty to stay in Monaco, in a
Andy-Sachs-Devil-Wears-Prada
esque epiphany, she decides to pre
pare to play the greatest role of her
life: to really give being her all to
being a Princess. And she's got
Derek Jacobi, who you would think
would have better things to do with
his time, to coach her through it all.
Once she learns to play the part of
the doting, pretty wife, she even

takes on politics, becoming the un
likely savior of a hopelessly antiquat
ed monarchy: she wins the world
over with a vapid speech at a party,
preventing France from annexing its
protectorate.

There could have been a good
film here, if the script expanded on
its shallow parallels between what it
means to be American Hollywood
royalty and European royalty and
how Grace straddled both worlds. It
could have taken a page out of the
"Gossip Girl" playbook, which had its
own ill-advised Blair Waldorf Princess

of Monaco storyline, which at least
dealt with the "Mad Men"-esque is
sues of how we all play parts in our
lives, and we can get into trouble
when we prioritize our image of our
selves over authenticity. Or it could
have gone in the complete opposite
direction, reveling in the camp that
the film is so unconsciously full of,
from the milky white light pouring
into all the windows to the lingering
melancholic close-ups, to strike a
tone more like "Moulin Rouge." In
stead, there's an inchoate script with
horrifically bad dialogue and over

the-top performances by talented ac
tors doing bad accents.
Although the Opening Night
Film at the Cannes Film Festival has
always been a star-studded affair,
gone are the days when excellent
films that didn't need the exposure,
like "Midnight in Paris" or "Moon
rise Kingdom," got the spotlight.
Lately, the only criterion seems to
be that the film must be all about
glitz and glamour, not unlike this
festival: at least at the Toronto Inter
national Film Festival, the stars get
dressed up to head to the premieres

with lay audiences. Last year's ef
fort, Baz Luhrmann's mediocre
"The Great Gatsby" at least had
some redeeming qualities, but the
all-star cast and Grace's very chic
outfits hardly make it even worth
while to spend two hours of your life
on "Grace of Monaco."

Meanwhile, other major film
festivals have been putting in more
effort to make the Opening Night
film count. "Whiplash" opened
Sundance in January and it has re
ceived a coveted spot at the Direc
tor's Fortnight at this year's Cannes.

"The Fifth Estate," at minimum a
showcase for the up-and-coming
Benedict Cumberbatch, and JimJar
musch's fantastic "Only Lovers Left
Alive" opened the Toronto Interna
tional Film Festival last fall. The lack
luster choices at Cannes suggest
that this is still a festival caught in
the past, hardly a surprise consider
ing almost all the spots in the Offi
cial Competition go to festival fre
quenters and favorites.
