# GRACE OF
## MONACO OLIVIER DAHAN'S FILM STARTS CANNES ON A MEDIOCRE NOTE 
### ALEXANDRA HEENEY MANAGING EDITOR 
What better way to inaugurate
the very exclusive 67th Cannes
Film Festival than with "Grace of
Monaco," a film that fails so spectac
ularly you wonder what it's even
doing on the program? Then again,
this is the festival that rewarded the
unwatchable "Uncle Boonmee Who
Can Recall His Past Lives" with its
top prize, the Palme d'Or, not too
long ago.

At about the 30-minute mark
in the second press screening of the
film, there was a sudden eruption of
laughter from the audience, no
longer able to contain its mockery:
Director Olivier Dahan was aimless
ly aiming his shaky camera at a long

close-up of Grace's (Nicole Kidman)
eyes, as she bemoans what a sad lot
it is to be the Princess of a silly na
tion.

Everything about this melodra
ma screams 'B' movie, but it makes
the mistake of taking itself seriously,
as if this could possibly be high art,
rather than relishing in its own pre
posterousness. From the mustache
twirling Royal familyâ€”the Prince
(Tim Roth) is always smoking a ciga
rette to the uptight royal assis
tant (Parker Posey) to the fact that it
asks us to take seriously both Mon
egasque politics and whether
Princess Grace had the right to cut
her hair short. Perhaps Dahan was
too focused on finding away to
make the very tall Kidman not look
like she's completely towering over

the very small Roth.
When the film begins, Princess
Grace is moping about how her
royal status prevents her from being
herself. Mr Hitchock pays a visit to
the palace to tempt her back into
the movies, and she seriously con
siders it. But when she realizes it's
her duty to stay in Monaco, in a
Andy-Sachs-Devil-Wears-Prada
esque epiphany, she decides to pre
pare to play the greatest role of her
life: to really give being her all to
being a Princess. And she's got
Derek Jacobi, who you would think
would have better things to do with
his time, to coach her through it all.
Once she learns to play the part of
the doting, pretty wife, she even
