# Lineup Lacks Luster
## Dispatch, Yeasayer pale in comparison to the spring concert headliners at peer universities 
### LUCY SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
This year Frost's lineup of Dis
patch and Yeasayer has prompted
student disappointment and has
also resulted in decreased ticket
sales for the annual music and arts
festival. As comparable universities
on the East Coast score stars such as
David Guetta, Lauryn Hill and
Chance the Rapper for spring con
certs, many Stanford students have
questioned why Stanford is not
bringing in the same level of talent.
Frances Ball' 15, director of the
Stanford Concert Network (SCN),
acknowledged that Dispatch is less
popular than the type of band that
the group had been hoping for.
"This year, one reason why
we're not selling as many tickets is
because we compromised," Ball
said. "Instead of having a really big
act, we had two medium acts, and I
think people just don't really know
the names as well."

Despite the lesser name recog
nition of Dispatch, Ball explained
that the band still ranked high on a
student-generated list of acts. SCN
begins the selection process for
Frost around November, when the
group develops a list of roughly 50
bands that people like, work with an

agent to narrow that list to 20 bands
and send that out to student body.
Based on the student data, SCN
then starts going after the No. 1
band on the list.

However, SCN has struggled to
get the top artists because many
have turned down the offer due to a
variety of reasons, including disin
terest, unavailability and budget
constraints.

"Generally the first few don't
work, and that kind of thing hap
pened this year," Ball said. "Dis
patch was high on our list, but not
one of the very top ones."
Yale and the University of Penn
sylvania have similar processes, but
both schools begin by soliciting stu
dent input from the student body
and then start whittling down the
list based on artist availability and
budget.

Budgets appear to be one of the
largest determining factors of the
spring concert lineups. SCN, a spe
cial fees group, is the primary finan
cial backer of Frost; around two
thirds of the event's budget is cov
ered by SCN special fees. Ticket
sales also fund a significant portion
of the event, with additional sup
port from sponsors such as the Of
fice of Alcohol Policy and Education,
the Arts Institute and the Graduate

Student Council.

Penn's spring concert is similar
ly funded through student activity
fees. However, the event also
charges significantly higher ticket
prices to provide a larger budget. Ac
cording to Ben Yang, the senior
managing director of concerts at
Penn, its 2014 Spring Fling sold out
at 8,500 students, with undergrad
uate floor seats priced at $45 and
stand seating priced at $35. Tickets
for graduate students and guests
were all priced at $7O. For Stan
ford's Frost, on the other hand, tick
ets cost $25 for students and $4O

for non-Stanford students with an
expected turnout of less than
5,000.

"We are utilizing ticket pricing
to basically allocate ourselves a big
ger budget," Yang said. "That really
makes a huge difference."
Yale's Spring Fling is also fund
ed through the school's student ac
tivities fee, but Yale does not charge
students for tickets to the concert.
In fact, unlike the concerts at Stan
ford and Penn, which draw substan
tial money from their ticket sales,
Yale's event operates solely with the
money allocated from the school.
Further, the Yale student activi
ty fee is $75, compared to Stan
ford's $429 annual student activity

fee giving the spring concert a
budget for talent that, according to
Erica Leh, head of Yale's Spring
Fling Committee, is one third that
of comparable universities.
Despite Spring Fling's more
limited funding, the organizers at
Yale work to secure artists early, this
year locking down headliner
Chance the Rapper by the end of
October.

"We try to work really quickly
so we can essentially low ball artists
who we think are going to become
popular," Leh said. "We had our en
tire lineup picked out in September
... and then we release at the begin
ning of the second semester."

Past headliners for Yale's Spring
Fling have included Macklemore,
Matt and Kim, Passion Pit and T-
Pain. This year, however, Yale faced
unexpected difficulties when
Chance canceled four days before
the event due to a hospitalization
for laryngitis, forcing the committee
to scramble to get another artist, Ja
Rule, within eight hours.
The funding for Harvard's Yard
fest, which featured Janelle Monae
this April, comes from an endow
ment gift allocated to the school's
College Events Board. The mission
