## SUDPS prepares for a safe Frost 
### CALEB SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Frost Music and Arts Fes
tival, set to occur this weekend,
will be staffed by a variety of safety
personnel. Deputies from the Stan
ford University Department of Pub
lic Safety (SUDPS), private security
from Landmark and emergency
medical technicians from the Stan
ford Emergency Medical Services
team (STEMS) will all work togeth
er to help keep the festival safe.
Safety personnel will be post
ed in a variety of locations during
the event. There will be a deputy
from SUDPS posted at each of the
gates, as well as inside Frost Am
phitheater. Although there will be
deputies posted at every gate, ac
cess to the festival will only be per
mitted through two gates: one of
them for general admission, and
the other an express gate for those
who don't have bags or other items
that need to be screened.
Alcohol is not allowed at the
event, and visibly intoxicated indi
viduals may be denied entry. Ac
cording to Bill Larson, SUDPS
spokesman, festivalgoers will be
observed prior to entry in order to
pick out individuals who have had
too much to drink.

Furthermore, individuals are
not allowed to bring alcohol into
the venue, and if alcohol is found,
ticketholders will be asked to re
turn it to their vehicle or residence
or to consume it where alcohol
consumption is allowed.
Ralph Castro, associate dean
of Student Affairs and head of the
Office of Alcohol Policy and Edu

cation (OAPE), supported Frost as
an alcohol-free event.

"We think it's a great event,"
Castro said. "We're grateful that
we get thousands of students that
come and... [that] avast majority
behave appropriately."
Smoking of any kind is also
prohibited. Portable chairs and
umbrellas are not allowed, nor
are any wheeled vehicles, record
ing equipment, pets, glass or
metal containers, Frisbees or gen
erally any dangerous item that
cannot be brought on an airplane.
SUDPS Deputy Pete Posada
noted that the warm weather
could lead to dehydration and
urged concertgoers to adequately
hydrate.
"Make sure that you're tak
ing care of yourself," Posada said,
adding that there will be water
stations at the event and advising
concertgoers to be familiar with
where they are located.

Stanford residents and visi
tors should prepare for traffic dis
ruptions in relation to the event.
Portions of Museum Way, Lasuen
Street and Memorial Way will be
closed or will experience restrict
ed access.

The preparations for secur
ing this year's Frost Music and
Arts Festival follow a few inci
dents in past years' festivals. Last
year, a non-Stanford student was
given an alcohol transport and a
graduate student sought atten
tion from paramedics last year
due to drug use.
