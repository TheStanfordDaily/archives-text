# Meet the Band
## The 						members of Stanford's own Paper Void, the opening act of Frost, discuss their musical histories and personal tastes 
### 
MC, VOCALS
Guzman 'l3 has been rapping
since he was 1 3 years old. He
has never had any formal
training in music theory but
loves producing and rapping:
"It's more about having an ear
than being musically trained,"
he said.

BASS GUITAR
Gitterman 'l4 was exposed to
jazz early in his life, having
played jazz saxophone since
fifth grade. In the beginning of
eighth grade he began to play
the bass with some friends. He
hasn't been in many formal
bands, opting to play more
casual jazz or funk gigs.

KEYBOARD
A piano player since he was
seven, Schreier 'l4 became
interested in jazz and formed
his own jazz combo group in
eighth grade, which would play
at cocktail parties: "I don't see
myself being a musician full
time," he said, although he
loves the unique experience of
being in Paper Void.

DRUMS
Favaro 'l2 is a multi
instrumentalist, playing the cello,
saxophone and piano from a
young age. However, he knew
very early on that he wanted to
play the drums "You get to hit
things," he said and had a
good sense of rhythm that he
attributes to his father, who was
also a drummer.

TRUMPET
While Ghansah '1 3 M.S. 'l4
was eight to 1 0 years old, he
played trumpet but never really
liked practicing reading
music was hard for him. In his
freshman year at Stanford he
became enamored with jazz
music, joining a jazz combo
and has since then dabbled in
composition.

GUITAR
In his sophomore year at Stanford,
Leeper '1 3 M.S. 'l4 took up music
production, and in his senior year he
learned the guitar and started perform
ing jazz before forming Paper Void in
the summer of 201 3. He was a
member of the Stanford Taiko group:
"The way I run this version is a toned
down version of the way Stanford
Taiko is run it's intense," he said.

TENOR SAXOPHONE
Ramsey 'l7 picked up the
saxophone in high school,
during which he was in the
marching band. For Paper Void,
he writes out the chords for other
members and improvises as well:
"I try and just not think about it,
just play what I can hear," he
said.
