## Class provides artwork for Frost ME289 offers students the exclusive opportunity to design and build Frost art

ter, with students splitting their time
between CCRMA and the Product
Realization Lab (PRL), depending on
the needs of their individual projects.
According to Sturtz, the most
rewarding aspect of the course was
forging a stronger connection be
tween the Institute of Design
(d.school) and the PRL, on-campus
resources that don't traditionally
overlap.

Musical guests Dispatch,
Yeasayer and Paper Void will draw
large crowds to this year's Frost
Music and Arts Festival, but a more
understated —while still integral
part of Saturday's experience will
be the student-created art installa
tions and performance pieces that
will be featured.

The driving force behind Frost's
arts showcase is the class
ME2B9A/B: Interactive Art and Per
formance Design, a class offered
through the Hasso Plattner Institute
of Design's ReDesigning Theater proj
ect. Led by instructors Michael
Sturtz, director of ReDesigning The
ater and mechanical engineering de
sign lecturer, and Sasha Leitman 'O5
M.A. 'O6, the projects manager at the
Center for Computer Research in
Music and Acoustics (CCRMA), the
two-quarter class took students
through the process of designing, pro
posing and building interactive art to
be showcased at Frost this Saturday.
During the first quarter of the
class, attended by both undergradu
ate and graduate students, students
learned to plan, budget and craft pro
posals for their project ideas. Sturtz
described the pitching process as a
"sort of version of the American
Idol," as students presented their
ideas and received feedback from a
guest panel of experts ranging from
artists to a co-founder of Burning
Man to mechanical and structural
engineers.

"We were able to go from de
sign thinking lessons at the d.school
to MAG and TIG welding lessons in
the PRL," he said.
For first-year graduate student
Cooper Newby, the course allowed
him to explore the mixing of engi
neering with creativity. Newby's art
installation, "Box of Stars," is an in
tricately-crafted cube composed of
lights and infinity mirrors that gives
the effect of an "infinite universe."

'"Box of Stars' is a curiosity-in
spiring project which kind of defies
physics a little bit," Newby said.
"There are five infinity mirrors on
the faces of the cube that warp with
how you look at it. Festival atten
dees can experience three-dimen
sional space within two-dimension
al frames."

Extensive engineering and
artistic experience was not a hard
requirement for enrolling in the
course, so Sturtz and Leitman spent
the second quarter teaching the
hands-on building skills and tech
niques necessary for building the
designed art.

Sam Gussman 'l6 cited
ME2B9 as the first time he created
an arts installation and said he did
not have much of a technical back-

The class transitioned from de
signing to building this spring quar-

ground before the course.
Gussman's "HOMER" (Hang
ing Objects Making Elliptical Rota
tions) is a kinetic sculpture that
aims to recreate feelings of child
hood innocence and fun. He de
scribed the installation as "a teeter
totter that also spins around 360 de
grees and is shaped like the scales of
justice." There are giant hammocks
on either end of the structure, and
festival-goers can sit on the revolv
ing seesaw and share the experi
ence with their friends.

The art projects aren't all instal
lations, however. Frost's sole per
formance piece, "Dizneylond Uni

versity," was conceived by Jake
Friedler 'l5 and Laura Petree 'l5,
both core members of the theater
group the Freeks. Over the course
of the quarter, six actors developed
their own characters based on fa
mous Disney characters for
"Dizneylond University," meant to
be a study into immersive theater.

"We wanted to strip away all
the traditional theatrical apparatus
es until all you have left are these
characters who are really good at
playing and exhibiting these traits,"
Friedler said.

The day of Frost, Friedler and
Petree will host a meet and greet

during the first two hours so that
people can come interact with the
characters. Afterwards, the actors
will disband within the festival, at
which point they are free to interact
with the public.
"Disney created Disney charac
ters, and we've created Disney hu
mans," Petree said. "They're like
real, fully-fledged people with moti
vations and personalities. There's
no plot, character arc, nothing.
They're just going to go live their
lives and we'll see what happens."
Ultimately, Sturtz hopes that
his students will take away from the
class a better understanding of how
to design for interaction.
"Designing for interaction
sounds easy," he said. "But to really
make something that's going to en
gage other people and draw their at
tention when they're in the middle
of a music festival and there's all
these other things going on, you
have to really capture their imagina
tion."

characters who are really good at
playing and exhibiting these traits,"
Friedler said.

The day of Frost, Friedler and
Petree will host a meet and greet

during the first two hours so that
people can come interact with the
characters. Afterwards, the actors
will disband within the festival, at
which point they are free to interact
with the public.
"Disney created Disney charac
ters, and we've created Disney hu
mans," Petree said. "They're like
real, fully-fledged people with moti
vations and personalities. There's
no plot, character arc, nothing.
They're just going to go live their
lives and we'll see what happens."
Ultimately, Sturtz hopes that
his students will take away from the
class a better understanding of how
to design for interaction.
"Designing for interaction
sounds easy," he said. "But to really
make something that's going to en
gage other people and draw their at
tention when they're in the middle
of a music festival and there's all
these other things going on, you
have to really capture their imagina
tion."

ter, with students splitting their time
between CCRMA and the Product
Realization Lab (PRL), depending on
the needs of their individual projects.
According to Sturtz, the most
rewarding aspect of the course was
forging a stronger connection be
tween the Institute of Design
(d.school) and the PRL, on-campus
resources that don't traditionally
overlap.

Musical guests Dispatch,
Yeasayer and Paper Void will draw
large crowds to this year's Frost
Music and Arts Festival, but a more
understated —while still integral
part of Saturday's experience will
be the student-created art installa
tions and performance pieces that
will be featured.

The driving force behind Frost's
arts showcase is the class
ME2B9A/B: Interactive Art and Per
formance Design, a class offered
through the Hasso Plattner Institute
of Design's ReDesigning Theater proj
ect. Led by instructors Michael
Sturtz, director of ReDesigning The
ater and mechanical engineering de
sign lecturer, and Sasha Leitman 'O5
M.A. 'O6, the projects manager at the
Center for Computer Research in
Music and Acoustics (CCRMA), the
two-quarter class took students
through the process of designing, pro
posing and building interactive art to
be showcased at Frost this Saturday.
During the first quarter of the
class, attended by both undergradu
ate and graduate students, students
learned to plan, budget and craft pro
posals for their project ideas. Sturtz
described the pitching process as a
"sort of version of the American
Idol," as students presented their
ideas and received feedback from a
guest panel of experts ranging from
artists to a co-founder of Burning
Man to mechanical and structural
engineers.

"We were able to go from de
sign thinking lessons at the d.school
to MAG and TIG welding lessons in
the PRL," he said.
For first-year graduate student
Cooper Newby, the course allowed
him to explore the mixing of engi
neering with creativity. Newby's art
installation, "Box of Stars," is an in
tricately-crafted cube composed of
lights and infinity mirrors that gives
the effect of an "infinite universe."

'"Box of Stars' is a curiosity-in
spiring project which kind of defies
physics a little bit," Newby said.
"There are five infinity mirrors on
the faces of the cube that warp with
how you look at it. Festival atten
dees can experience three-dimen
sional space within two-dimension
al frames."

Extensive engineering and
artistic experience was not a hard
requirement for enrolling in the
course, so Sturtz and Leitman spent
the second quarter teaching the
hands-on building skills and tech
niques necessary for building the
designed art.

Sam Gussman 'l6 cited
ME2B9 as the first time he created
an arts installation and said he did
not have much of a technical back-

The class transitioned from de
signing to building this spring quar-

ground before the course.
Gussman's "HOMER" (Hang
ing Objects Making Elliptical Rota
tions) is a kinetic sculpture that
aims to recreate feelings of child
hood innocence and fun. He de
scribed the installation as "a teeter
totter that also spins around 360 de
grees and is shaped like the scales of
justice." There are giant hammocks
on either end of the structure, and
festival-goers can sit on the revolv
ing seesaw and share the experi
ence with their friends.

The art projects aren't all instal
lations, however. Frost's sole per
formance piece, "Dizneylond Uni

versity," was conceived by Jake
Friedler 'l5 and Laura Petree 'l5,
both core members of the theater
group the Freeks. Over the course
of the quarter, six actors developed
their own characters based on fa
mous Disney characters for
"Dizneylond University," meant to
be a study into immersive theater.

"We wanted to strip away all
the traditional theatrical apparatus
es until all you have left are these
characters who are really good at
playing and exhibiting these traits,"
Friedler said.
