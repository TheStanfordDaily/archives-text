## Op-Ed Frost Festival ices women out: An open letter to the Stanford Concert Network 
### 
Dear Stanford Concert Network,

We love music; we love sun
shine; we love Stanford
tradition. The Frost Festi
val is a unique opportunity to bring
these three things together, and we
commend the Concert Network for
the work it does in orchestrating the
large-scale, celebrity-drenched af
fair. We can't help but notice,
though, that there's a striking trend
among the 31 performers you have
brought to Stanford for the Frost
Festival over the past three years. All
of the 31 performers are male.

The Frost Festival is hailed as a
revival of a countercultural music tra
dition; the performers it featured (in
cluding Joan Baez) have often fa
mously and effectively advocated for
equal rights, political activism and so
cial justice. But the revival of the fes
tival has failed the Frost tradition
and, more importantly, the students
that support it in its problematic
underrepresentation of historically
oppressed populations.

The Stanford Concert Network
is sponsored by Stanford and is re
sponsible to its constituents. In other
words, our money (and lots of it)
heavily subsidizes Frost. We ask that
the Concert Network and its super
visors consider the dramatic evi
dence of bias in its choice of lineup
and work to correct it for future
years. The slighting of women vio
lates the spirit of Title IX (to which
Stanford is bound as a federally fund
ed university) and undermines the

fair and inclusive culture Stanford
strives to maintain.

Let's take a look, for a moment,
at how the Frost Festival is advertised
in contrast to the performances it of
fers. The organizers chose to publi
cize the pioneering Frost Revival with
a poster featuring a thin blond white
woman in a skirt so short it falls
above where her groin should be; the
second Frost Festival with yet anoth
erwhite, straight-haired woman with
suggestively parted lips; and this
year's Festival with a woman's nail
polished, many-ringed, and bracelet
laden hands. Obviously, women
adorned, sexualized women are
being used as poster-girls for the festi
val. Why is it, then, that not one of the
performers on stage is a woman? The
Frost Festival's regrettable advertising
coupled with its irresponsible lineup
sends students a distressing message:
women are observers, draws, adver
tisements, the "beautiful people" that
the Concert Network prominently ad
vertises will be in attendance. Women
are valued for their bodies, not for tal
ents of their own. Women are the
image; men are the voice.
Is it really so difficult to find a fe
male performer worthy of Stanford
who's available to perform? And why
has nobody even seemed to notice
the imbalance? Our faculty is still
heavily male (a mere 27 percent are
women), and female students are in
the minority of undergraduates and
constitute only 38 percent of the
