## Op-Ed Frost Festival ices women out: An open letter to the Stanford Concert Network 
### 
Dear Stanford Concert Network,

We love music; we love sun
shine; we love Stanford
tradition. The Frost Festi
val is a unique opportunity to bring
these three things together, and we
commend the Concert Network for
the work it does in orchestrating the
large-scale, celebrity-drenched af
fair. We can't help but notice,
though, that there's a striking trend
among the 31 performers you have
brought to Stanford for the Frost
Festival over the past three years. All
of the 31 performers are male.

The Frost Festival is hailed as a
revival of a countercultural music tra
dition; the performers it featured (in
cluding Joan Baez) have often fa
mously and effectively advocated for
equal rights, political activism and so
cial justice. But the revival of the fes
tival has failed the Frost tradition
and, more importantly, the students
that support it in its problematic
underrepresentation of historically
oppressed populations.

The Stanford Concert Network
is sponsored by Stanford and is re
sponsible to its constituents. In other
words, our money (and lots of it)
heavily subsidizes Frost. We ask that
the Concert Network and its super
visors consider the dramatic evi
dence of bias in its choice of lineup
and work to correct it for future
years. The slighting of women vio
lates the spirit of Title IX (to which
Stanford is bound as a federally fund
ed university) and undermines the

fair and inclusive culture Stanford
strives to maintain.

Let's take a look, for a moment,
at how the Frost Festival is advertised
in contrast to the performances it of
fers. The organizers chose to publi
cize the pioneering Frost Revival with
a poster featuring a thin blond white
woman in a skirt so short it falls
above where her groin should be; the
second Frost Festival with yet anoth
erwhite, straight-haired woman with
suggestively parted lips; and this
year's Festival with a woman's nail
polished, many-ringed, and bracelet
laden hands. Obviously, women
adorned, sexualized women are
being used as poster-girls for the festi
val. Why is it, then, that not one of the
performers on stage is a woman? The
Frost Festival's regrettable advertising
coupled with its irresponsible lineup
sends students a distressing message:
women are observers, draws, adver
tisements, the "beautiful people" that
the Concert Network prominently ad
vertises will be in attendance. Women
are valued for their bodies, not for tal
ents of their own. Women are the
image; men are the voice.
Is it really so difficult to find a fe
male performer worthy of Stanford
who's available to perform? And why
has nobody even seemed to notice
the imbalance? Our faculty is still
heavily male (a mere 27 percent are
women), and female students are in
the minority of undergraduates and
constitute only 38 percent of the
graduate population; must Stanford project
males as its cultural icons, too?
Women aren't the only casualties of the
Concert Network's selection. The musical
taste these male groups represent is generally
identified with white middle- to upper-class
men. As individuals, many of us may happen to
enjoy Dispatch and Yeasayer (this year's head
liners), and no doubt many white male musi
cians are talented, worthy, and popular. But
when musical styles identified with and rooted
in Black, Chicano, Latino, Asian, Native Amer
ican and other communities are comparatively
underrepresented, something is amiss. The
Concert Network suffers from some blind
spots in their selection process that call for im
mediate redress.

What message is the Concert Network's
choice of performers sending to the world
about Stanford's values and its community
members? What message is it sending to Stan
ford students themselves about who does and
doesn't belong here? What are the long-term
consequences of subsidizing and glorifying the
music performed and valued by a privileged
subset of our population?
As members of the Stanford community,
the issues we've outlined here should also raise
all of our awareness, about the organizations

we vote to support with our Special Fees. It is
our responsibility to monitor the inclusiveness,
efficacy and fairness of the groups we support
in order to ensure that our money is spent eth
ically and productively. Stanford students are
privileged with the ability to vote on how Stan
ford spends its Special Fees money; we are
therefore responsible for exercising due dili
gence in following and striving to better the
practices of the organizations we support.
Not too long ago, the ASSU election ap
proved the Stanford Concert Network for
$256,175 in Special Fees, the largest amount
approved for a single group this year. The Stan
ford African Students Association (SASA) was
rejected for less than a tenth of that amount
($25,200). SASA has already written an op-ed
addressing the results of the election; our ob
jective is merely to bring to student attention
to what our votes demonstrate about our prior
ities and (often unconscious) exclusions.
We hope that this letter will open conver
sation between the Concert Network and
many of the underrepresented communities at
Stanford, and we would love to be a part of
ameliorating misrepresentation at the Frost
Festival and the many analogous events for
which it sets a precedent. Together with the
Stanford students who fund and support it, we
ask that the Concert Network take a long, hard
look at the performers the Frost Festival choos
es to promote and the consequences that
those choices have for the Stanford communi
ty not to mention for the artists denied op
portunity and funding.
Women deserve to be on stage at Frost.
Correcting this problem at home is the first
step to ensuring stanford's women performers
the recognition they're due around the world
when it comes time for them to leave the Farm.
Besides, it stands to reason that expanding the
pool of contenders will improve the music, too
and it will certainly expand its audience.

Dear Stanford Concert Network,

We love music; we love sun
shine; we love Stanford
tradition. The Frost Festi
val is a unique opportunity to bring
these three things together, and we
commend the Concert Network for
the work it does in orchestrating the
large-scale, celebrity-drenched af
fair. We can't help but notice,
though, that there's a striking trend
among the 31 performers you have
brought to Stanford for the Frost
Festival over the past three years. All
of the 31 performers are male.

The Frost Festival is hailed as a
revival of a countercultural music tra
dition; the performers it featured (in
cluding Joan Baez) have often fa
mously and effectively advocated for
equal rights, political activism and so
cial justice. But the revival of the fes
tival has failed the Frost tradition
and, more importantly, the students
that support it in its problematic
underrepresentation of historically
oppressed populations.

The Stanford Concert Network
is sponsored by Stanford and is re
sponsible to its constituents. In other
words, our money (and lots of it)
heavily subsidizes Frost. We ask that
the Concert Network and its super
visors consider the dramatic evi
dence of bias in its choice of lineup
and work to correct it for future
years. The slighting of women vio
lates the spirit of Title IX (to which
Stanford is bound as a federally fund
ed university) and undermines the

fair and inclusive culture Stanford
strives to maintain.

Let's take a look, for a moment,
at how the Frost Festival is advertised
in contrast to the performances it of
fers. The organizers chose to publi
cize the pioneering Frost Revival with
a poster featuring a thin blond white
woman in a skirt so short it falls
above where her groin should be; the
second Frost Festival with yet anoth
erwhite, straight-haired woman with
suggestively parted lips; and this
year's Festival with a woman's nail
polished, many-ringed, and bracelet
laden hands. Obviously, women
adorned, sexualized women are
being used as poster-girls for the festi
val. Why is it, then, that not one of the
performers on stage is a woman? The
Frost Festival's regrettable advertising
coupled with its irresponsible lineup
sends students a distressing message:
women are observers, draws, adver
tisements, the "beautiful people" that
the Concert Network prominently ad
vertises will be in attendance. Women
are valued for their bodies, not for tal
ents of their own. Women are the
image; men are the voice.
Is it really so difficult to find a fe
male performer worthy of Stanford
who's available to perform? And why
has nobody even seemed to notice
the imbalance? Our faculty is still
heavily male (a mere 27 percent are
women), and female students are in
the minority of undergraduates and
constitute only 38 percent of the
graduate population; must Stanford project
males as its cultural icons, too?
Women aren't the only casualties of the
Concert Network's selection. The musical
taste these male groups represent is generally
identified with white middle- to upper-class
men. As individuals, many of us may happen to
enjoy Dispatch and Yeasayer (this year's head
liners), and no doubt many white male musi
cians are talented, worthy, and popular. But
when musical styles identified with and rooted
in Black, Chicano, Latino, Asian, Native Amer
ican and other communities are comparatively
underrepresented, something is amiss. The
Concert Network suffers from some blind
spots in their selection process that call for im
mediate redress.

What message is the Concert Network's
choice of performers sending to the world
about Stanford's values and its community
members? What message is it sending to Stan
ford students themselves about who does and
doesn't belong here? What are the long-term
consequences of subsidizing and glorifying the
music performed and valued by a privileged
subset of our population?
As members of the Stanford community,
the issues we've outlined here should also raise
all of our awareness, about the organizations

we vote to support with our Special Fees. It is
our responsibility to monitor the inclusiveness,
efficacy and fairness of the groups we support
in order to ensure that our money is spent eth
ically and productively. Stanford students are
privileged with the ability to vote on how Stan
ford spends its Special Fees money; we are
therefore responsible for exercising due dili
gence in following and striving to better the
practices of the organizations we support.
Not too long ago, the ASSU election ap
proved the Stanford Concert Network for
$256,175 in Special Fees, the largest amount
approved for a single group this year. The Stan
ford African Students Association (SASA) was
rejected for less than a tenth of that amount
($25,200). SASA has already written an op-ed
addressing the results of the election; our ob
jective is merely to bring to student attention
to what our votes demonstrate about our prior
ities and (often unconscious) exclusions.
We hope that this letter will open conver
sation between the Concert Network and
many of the underrepresented communities at
Stanford, and we would love to be a part of
ameliorating misrepresentation at the Frost
Festival and the many analogous events for
which it sets a precedent. Together with the
Stanford students who fund and support it, we
ask that the Concert Network take a long, hard
look at the performers the Frost Festival choos
es to promote and the consequences that
those choices have for the Stanford communi
ty not to mention for the artists denied op
portunity and funding.
Women deserve to be on stage at Frost.
Correcting this problem at home is the first
step to ensuring stanford's women performers
the recognition they're due around the world
when it comes time for them to leave the Farm.
Besides, it stands to reason that expanding the
pool of contenders will improve the music, too
and it will certainly expand its audience.
