## Transgender inclusion in sports 
### Stanford Athletes end Allies Together 
(Trigger warning: For the purpose
of education, this article mentions
terms that have been used as slurs and
in hateful speech against members of
theLCBT community.!

When Michael Sam was
drafted by the St. Louis
Rams this past weekend,
he became the first openly gay player
in the NFL In February, former Stan
ford basketball star Jason Collins 'Ol
made news as an openly gay sports
icon competing in a major American
sport. And Russia's Winter Olympic
Games in Sochi, Brazil's 2014 World
Cup and NBAs ban of Donald Ster
ling show that sports can be a flash
point for controversies surrounding
race, class and LGBT rights.
Last week's Transgender
Awareness Week at Stanford cast a
spotlight on an underserved and
less visible segment of the LGBT

community, culminating in a well-at
tended talk by Laverne Cox. And
while you may binge on Netflix's
"Orange Is the New Black," in
which Cox stars, you may not know
as much about the topic of transgen
der athletes in sports.
In this op-ed we raise issues rel
evant to trans athletes at Stanford
and beyond. Formed last year, the
student group Stanford Athletes
and Allies Together (StAAT) works
to ensure that athletics are a safe
and supportive space for all athletes,
regardless of sexual orientation,
gender identity or gender expres
sion. This aligns with the NCAA's
commitment to diversity, inclusion
and gender equity among its stu
dent-athletes, coaches and adminis
trators. As part of an effort to raise
awareness and educate student-ath
letes and allies, here is how you can
help.

As a player on the field or a fan
in the stands, consider that words
matter. Terms such as "fag," "tran
ny" and so on have no place in
sports. Stemming from the gender
stereotypes of each sport, these
derogatory phrases serve to police
whether each athlete prescribes to
society's image of the "ideal" man or
woman. Athletes must be respected
based on their athletic ability, not
judged on whether they are consid
ered "masculine" or "feminine"
enough while competing.
If you serve as a leader in athlet
ics, whether as a captain, coach or
staff member, be explicitly inclusive
on paper and in person, especially at
the beginning of a season. In that
first team meeting, a statement by
you as a leader welcoming all
of your team members that includes

the words lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgen
der would let us know we are accepted by
you, and the team will follow your lead. Ac
tively educate yourself about issues of diversi
ty, and reach out to StAAT or the LGBT Com
munity Resource Center for additional re
sources. When silence or intolerance is the
norm, showing subtle forms of support can
help, such as wearing a StAAT or "Ally" but
ton, or displaying a "This is a safe space" stick
er (provided at the LGBT-CRC) outside your
door. It does not need to be difficult to foster
respect for all teammates.
On a larger scale, the International
Olympic Committee and New York State's
Education Department have official guide
lines for transgender athletes. California's
A81266 protects K-12 youth from discrimina
tion on the basis of gender, gender expression
and gender identity, extending to sex-segre
gated school activities such as athletic teams
and competitions. U.S. Soccer is one national
governing body (NGB) which has adopted
trans inclusive policies, but more work needs
to be done in reaching out to other NGBs.
In 2011, the NCAA published a guide
book of recommended policies for the inclu
sion of collegiate transgender student-ath
letes. Since then, various universities have

adopted transgender policies (see transath
lete.com for a list). These actions affirm that
organizations such as the NCAA want to make
athletics a welcoming space for transgender
athletes. The NCAA Office of Inclusion
states, "As a core value, the NCAA believes in
and is committed to diversity, inclusion and
gender equity among its student-athletes,
coaches and administrators."

We respectfully ask that Stanford Univer
sity adopt the NCAA Inclusion of Transgender
Student-Athletes policy as part of the larger
process of making our teams a welcoming at
mosphere for transgender athletes. The De
partment of Athletics at UC-Berkeley adopted
these policies in 2011, signaling the attention
of the Cal athletics administration to LGBT is
sues and representing an administrative ef
fort to educate coaches and athletes about
these issues. While ensuring that transgender
athletes can compete, these policies are in no
way perfect, neglecting to address concerns
outside of the gender binary. Nevertheless,
they are an important starting point. StAAT
hopes to work alongside the athletic depart
ment to discuss the process for Stanford to
adopt such a policy.

staff member, be explicitly inclusive
on paper and in person, especially at
the beginning of a season. In that
first team meeting, a statement by
you as a leader welcoming all
of your team members that includes

the words lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgen
der would let us know we are accepted by
you, and the team will follow your lead. Ac
tively educate yourself about issues of diversi
ty, and reach out to StAAT or the LGBT Com
munity Resource Center for additional re
sources. When silence or intolerance is the
norm, showing subtle forms of support can
help, such as wearing a StAAT or "Ally" but
ton, or displaying a "This is a safe space" stick
er (provided at the LGBT-CRC) outside your
door. It does not need to be difficult to foster
respect for all teammates.
On a larger scale, the International
Olympic Committee and New York State's
Education Department have official guide
lines for transgender athletes. California's
A81266 protects K-12 youth from discrimina
tion on the basis of gender, gender expression
and gender identity, extending to sex-segre
gated school activities such as athletic teams
and competitions. U.S. Soccer is one national
governing body (NGB) which has adopted
trans inclusive policies, but more work needs
to be done in reaching out to other NGBs.
In 2011, the NCAA published a guide
book of recommended policies for the inclu
sion of collegiate transgender student-ath
letes. Since then, various universities have

adopted transgender policies (see transath
lete.com for a list). These actions affirm that
organizations such as the NCAA want to make
athletics a welcoming space for transgender
athletes. The NCAA Office of Inclusion
states, "As a core value, the NCAA believes in
and is committed to diversity, inclusion and
gender equity among its student-athletes,
coaches and administrators."

We respectfully ask that Stanford Univer
sity adopt the NCAA Inclusion of Transgender
Student-Athletes policy as part of the larger
process of making our teams a welcoming at
mosphere for transgender athletes. The De
partment of Athletics at UC-Berkeley adopted
these policies in 2011, signaling the attention
of the Cal athletics administration to LGBT is
sues and representing an administrative ef
fort to educate coaches and athletes about
these issues. While ensuring that transgender
athletes can compete, these policies are in no
way perfect, neglecting to address concerns
outside of the gender binary. Nevertheless,
they are an important starting point. StAAT
hopes to work alongside the athletic depart
ment to discuss the process for Stanford to
adopt such a policy.

(Trigger warning: For the purpose
of education, this article mentions
terms that have been used as slurs and
in hateful speech against members of
theLCBT community.!

When Michael Sam was
drafted by the St. Louis
Rams this past weekend,
he became the first openly gay player
in the NFL In February, former Stan
ford basketball star Jason Collins 'Ol
made news as an openly gay sports
icon competing in a major American
sport. And Russia's Winter Olympic
Games in Sochi, Brazil's 2014 World
Cup and NBAs ban of Donald Ster
ling show that sports can be a flash
point for controversies surrounding
race, class and LGBT rights.
Last week's Transgender
Awareness Week at Stanford cast a
spotlight on an underserved and
less visible segment of the LGBT

community, culminating in a well-at
tended talk by Laverne Cox. And
while you may binge on Netflix's
"Orange Is the New Black," in
which Cox stars, you may not know
as much about the topic of transgen
der athletes in sports.
In this op-ed we raise issues rel
evant to trans athletes at Stanford
and beyond. Formed last year, the
student group Stanford Athletes
and Allies Together (StAAT) works
to ensure that athletics are a safe
and supportive space for all athletes,
regardless of sexual orientation,
gender identity or gender expres
sion. This aligns with the NCAA's
commitment to diversity, inclusion
and gender equity among its stu
dent-athletes, coaches and adminis
trators. As part of an effort to raise
awareness and educate student-ath
letes and allies, here is how you can
help.

As a player on the field or a fan
in the stands, consider that words
matter. Terms such as "fag," "tran
ny" and so on have no place in
sports. Stemming from the gender
stereotypes of each sport, these
derogatory phrases serve to police
whether each athlete prescribes to
society's image of the "ideal" man or
woman. Athletes must be respected
based on their athletic ability, not
judged on whether they are consid
ered "masculine" or "feminine"
enough while competing.
