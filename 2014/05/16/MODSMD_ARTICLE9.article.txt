## Transgender inclusion in sports

When Michael Sam was
drafted by the St. Louis
Rams this past weekend,
he became the first openly gay player
in the NFL In February, former Stan
ford basketball star Jason Collins 'Ol
made news as an openly gay sports
icon competing in a major American
sport. And Russia's Winter Olympic
Games in Sochi, Brazil's 2014 World
Cup and NBAs ban of Donald Ster

race, class and LGBT rights.

staff member, be explicitly inclusive
on paper and in person, especially at
the beginning of a season. In that
first team meeting, a statement by
you as a leader welcoming all
