# TRACK & FIELD
## Quartet of titles for Card Brooks breaks triple jump record 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
On the first day of competi
tion at the Pac-12 Champi
onships in Pullman, Washing
ton, Stanford track and field
won three individual titles
the most of any school. After the
first day of competition of the
two-day event, the Cardinal
men sat in seventh place, while
the women sat in fourth. At the
end of the second day, both
squads had improved from their
first-day placements, with the
women tying for third and the
men finishing in sixth.
In the final day of competi
tion, Stanford took home one
more title in the men's triple
jump, with junior Darian
Brooks breaking the school
record that was set back in 1970.
However, Brooks, who broke
three personal records over the
span of competition, still trailed
by three-quarters of an inch
with one jump left.
"When you get into competi
tion, the adrenaline is pump
ing," said Brooks to GoStan
ford.com. "Even if I had broken
my foot, it wouldn't have mat
tered. I would have kept jump
ing. I was feeling strong, I've
been working for something
special and I felt today had to be
that day."
His final jump soared him
past Arizona State's narrow
lead and gave Brooks a decisive
17-inch victory with what was
the lOth-longest jump of any Di
vision I athlete this year.
"Darian was probably the
most undertrained and least
competed athlete in the field,"
said jump coach Michael Eskind
to GoStanford.com. "But we've
known he was capable of big
things since the testing we did in
the fall. The ability level was
there. He just needed to step up
to competitions like this to bring it
out... He's a whole new jumper
now. He's put himself on the nation
al level."
On Saturday, junior Brianna
Bain won her third consecutive con
ference women's javelin title, with
freshman Megan Glasmann, the
reigning U.S. junior national cham
pion, coming in second. Bain is one
among only three other women in
conference history to have won at
least three titles in the event. In
men's javelin, sophomore Andrew
Rondema finished just seventh de

spite recording a personal record
(205-6,62.65 m) that placed him sixth
in Stanford's all-time record list.
"Finishing 1-2 was one of our
goals," said Bain to
GoStanford.com. "Having Megan
on the podium was really exciting."
Junior Joe Rosa and senior Jes
sica Tonn swept the 10,000 meter
races to complete the three-title
day for the Card on Saturday. Tonn
won her race with a personal best
of 34:09.13. It was the first Pac-12
title for both distance runners;
Tonn had been runner-up in the
event at last year's race.
"The game plan was to go out
there conservatively and hang in
the back for a little bit," Tonn told
GoStanford. "But of course I did
the complete opposite, and took

the lead, which is totally fine. I felt
really comfortable out there and
it's almost better for me to be out
in front and kind of be in control."
Stanford also had the top quali
fying times for three other run
ning events. Senior Michael
Atchoo and sophomore Rebecca
Mehra both led the 1,500 meter
race with times of 3:47.21 and
4:23.95, respectively. Three other
Cardinal men and two women
qualified for the event, as well.
Atchoo ended up finishing third in
the finals of the event. Junior Ais
ling Cuffe finished second in both
the finals of the women's 1,500 and
5,000.
In addition, sophomore Steven
Solomon was one of the favorites in
the men's 400 heading into Sun

day's final after recording a time of
46.39. Solomon, however, would be
going up against the World Cham
pionship 4x400 gold medalist
Michael Berry of Oregon. Unfortu
nately for Solomon, Berry bested
the defending Australian national
champion by just 0.75 seconds to
take first in the event.
On Sunday, sophomore Nick
Budincich recorded a personal best
in the men's discus with a mark of
54.27 meters, while freshman
Valarie Allman finished second in
the women's discus.
The preliminary round of the
NCAA Finals will begin Thursday,
May 29, in Fayetteville, Arkansas.

ing. I was feeling strong, I've
been working for something
special and I felt today had to be
that day."
His final jump soared him
past Arizona State's narrow
lead and gave Brooks a decisive
17-inch victory with what was
the lOth-longest jump of any Di
vision I athlete this year.
"Darian was probably the
most undertrained and least
competed athlete in the field,"
said jump coach Michael Eskind
to GoStanford.com. "But we've
known he was capable of big
things since the testing we did in
the fall. The ability level was
there. He just needed to step up
to competitions like this to bring it
out... He's a whole new jumper
now. He's put himself on the nation
al level."
On Saturday, junior Brianna
Bain won her third consecutive con
ference women's javelin title, with
freshman Megan Glasmann, the
reigning U.S. junior national cham
pion, coming in second. Bain is one
among only three other women in
conference history to have won at
least three titles in the event. In
men's javelin, sophomore Andrew
Rondema finished just seventh de

spite recording a personal record
(205-6,62.65 m) that placed him sixth
in Stanford's all-time record list.
"Finishing 1-2 was one of our
goals," said Bain to
GoStanford.com. "Having Megan
on the podium was really exciting."
Junior Joe Rosa and senior Jes
sica Tonn swept the 10,000 meter
races to complete the three-title
day for the Card on Saturday. Tonn
won her race with a personal best
of 34:09.13. It was the first Pac-12
title for both distance runners;
Tonn had been runner-up in the
event at last year's race.
"The game plan was to go out
there conservatively and hang in
the back for a little bit," Tonn told
GoStanford. "But of course I did
the complete opposite, and took

the lead, which is totally fine. I felt
really comfortable out there and
it's almost better for me to be out
in front and kind of be in control."
Stanford also had the top quali
fying times for three other run
ning events. Senior Michael
Atchoo and sophomore Rebecca
Mehra both led the 1,500 meter
race with times of 3:47.21 and
4:23.95, respectively. Three other
Cardinal men and two women
qualified for the event, as well.
Atchoo ended up finishing third in
the finals of the event. Junior Ais
ling Cuffe finished second in both
the finals of the women's 1,500 and
5,000.
In addition, sophomore Steven
Solomon was one of the favorites in
the men's 400 heading into Sun

day's final after recording a time of
46.39. Solomon, however, would be
going up against the World Cham
pionship 4x400 gold medalist
Michael Berry of Oregon. Unfortu
nately for Solomon, Berry bested
the defending Australian national
champion by just 0.75 seconds to
take first in the event.
On Sunday, sophomore Nick
Budincich recorded a personal best
in the men's discus with a mark of
54.27 meters, while freshman
Valarie Allman finished second in
the women's discus.
The preliminary round of the
NCAA Finals will begin Thursday,
May 29, in Fayetteville, Arkansas.

Junior Brianna Bain (above) won the Pac-12 women's javelin title on Saturday for the third straight year over the weekend in Pullman. Freshman
Megan Glasmann finished in second to complete the 1-2 sweep. Stanford also won the men's triple jump and swept the 10,000-meter event.
On the first day of competi
tion at the Pac-12 Champi
onships in Pullman, Washing
ton, Stanford track and field
won three individual titles
the most of any school. After the
first day of competition of the
two-day event, the Cardinal
men sat in seventh place, while
the women sat in fourth. At the
end of the second day, both
squads had improved from their
first-day placements, with the
women tying for third and the
men finishing in sixth.
In the final day of competi
tion, Stanford took home one
more title in the men's triple
jump, with junior Darian
Brooks breaking the school
record that was set back in 1970.
However, Brooks, who broke
three personal records over the
span of competition, still trailed
by three-quarters of an inch
with one jump left.
"When you get into competi
tion, the adrenaline is pump
ing," said Brooks to GoStan
ford.com. "Even if I had broken
my foot, it wouldn't have mat
tered. I would have kept jump
ing. I was feeling strong, I've
been working for something
special and I felt today had to be
that day."
His final jump soared him
past Arizona State's narrow
lead and gave Brooks a decisive
