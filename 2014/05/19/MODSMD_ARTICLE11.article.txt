# OPINIONS
## LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
### NICHOLAS JENKINS Associate Professor, Department of English 
While I am grateful for Liam
Kinney's interest in the
"CS+X" initiative ("CS+X
-traordinary," The Stanford
Daily, May 15), a number of things
troubled me about his op-ed. To go
through all the problems his piece
raises would take too much space.
Instead, I will mention just a couple
of points, one large and one small.
First, Kinney characterizes the
Symbolic Systems program as "the
next best thing to Computer Sci
ence." This is a statement which is
plainly wrong-headed these two
great and very popular Stanford
majors have quite distinct aims and
different intellectual foci. To speak
of one as if it were the inferior fall
back of the other is, to put it mildly,
a disservice to both.
Second, Kinney blankly de

scribes me as "directing" the CS+X
initiative. That's misleading.
CS+X, building on an idea first sug
gested by CS professor Eric
Roberts, is a collective project on
which very many faculty and staff
have collaborated intensively over
the last year or so. While I direct the
initiative within VPUE, each of the
ten CS+X Joint Majors approved
by the Faculty Senate is housed in
side two partnering departments
and is shaped, steered and adminis
tered by the faculty in these depart
ments, not by me.
