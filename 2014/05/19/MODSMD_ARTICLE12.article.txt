The Stanford Class of 2014
Commencement speakers,
Bill and Melinda Gates, are
currently facing global scrutiny for
their foundation's $172 million in
vestment in G4S, the world's largest
private military and security com
pany. As graduating seniors, we
would like to enumerate these con
cerns and discuss a new campaign,
composed of a broad coalition of stu
dents that has formed to call upon
the Gates Foundation to divest from
G4S and other compromising indus
tries and practices, such as priva
tized prisons, military contracting
and labor exploitation.

Because the Gates Foundation
has been such a strong force in al
most every area of philanthropy, it
is very disturbing that it invests in a
company like G4S, which is respon
sible for a litany of human rights
abuses affecting many of the same
communities that the Foundation
targets for assistance. G4S oper
ates private juvenile detention fa
cilities in the United States as well
as over 100 vehicles that bring cap
tured undocumented immigrants
to detention centers on the
U.S./Mexico border. The company

fails to properly house asylum
seekers in UK detention centers,
which resulted in the death of
Jimmy Mubenga, who was killed
while being deported to Angola, as
well as the death of 15-year-old
Gareth Myatt, who was killed while
being restrained at a youth deten
tion center.

Additionally, G4S operates pris
ons, detention and interrogation
centers in Israel and the Occupied
Palestinian Territories, which hold
more than 5,000 political prisoners,
173 children and 180 people in in
definite detainment. In one case,
Arafat Jaradat died from torture in
a G4S-secured detention center in
2013. G4S also operates the world's
second-largest private prison in
South Africa, which is currently
under investigation for using forced
injections and shock therapy to
subdue inmates. The company vio
lates international labor codes by
paying substandard wages and
using racist language and policies
against employees in Malawi,
Mozambique and South Africa,
where University of Cape Town
students are campaigning to
remove the company as the
university's security con
tractor due to its mistreat
ment of workers.
In response to the Gates
Foundation's investments in
G4S and because the Gates'
are this year's commence
ment speakers, Stanford stu
dents have mobilized to call
on the Gates Foundation to
divest from G4S and to
reevaluate its investments in
companies under investiga
tion for human rights abuses,
as well as companies that
maintain compromising
practices such as privatized
prisons, military contracting
and labor exploitation.
We also are asking the
Foundation to publicize its
policy of socially responsible
investment for the BMGF
Asset Trust detailing its poli
cy for ethical investment,
how it will guard against sup
porting unethical practices
and how it will respond to un
ethical companies already
within its endowment. Short
of divestment, we request
that the Gates' and the Gates
Foundation justify why alle
viating poverty requires in

vestment in companies that
oppress the same communi
ties the foundation's philan
thropy targets.
We appreciate the Gates'
willingness to share their
time with the Class of 2014
and the Stanford community.
While here, we ask that they
engage in dialogue about
principles for making the
world a better place. Invest
ments in G4S are a crucial
contradiction to our individ
ual and collective values as
upcoming leaders in the
global community The com
pany's practices undermine
the Gates Foundation's phil
anthropic legacy and Stan
ford's Founding Grant,
which tasks students with
"[promoting] the public wel
fare by exercising an influ
ence in behalf of humanity
and civilization." We should
seek to utilize our influence
towards this end as Stanford
students and as the audience
of the Gates commencement
address.
