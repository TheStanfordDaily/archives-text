The Stanford Class of 2014
Commencement speakers,
Bill and Melinda Gates, are
currently facing global scrutiny for
their foundation's $172 million in
vestment in G4S, the world's largest
private military and security com
pany. As graduating seniors, we
would like to enumerate these con
cerns and discuss a new campaign,
composed of a broad coalition of stu
dents that has formed to call upon
the Gates Foundation to divest from
G4S and other compromising indus
tries and practices, such as priva
tized prisons, military contracting
and labor exploitation.

Because the Gates Foundation
has been such a strong force in al
most every area of philanthropy, it
is very disturbing that it invests in a
company like G4S, which is respon
sible for a litany of human rights
abuses affecting many of the same
communities that the Foundation
targets for assistance. G4S oper
ates private juvenile detention fa
cilities in the United States as well
as over 100 vehicles that bring cap
tured undocumented immigrants
to detention centers on the
U.S./Mexico border. The company

fails to properly house asylum
seekers in UK detention centers,
which resulted in the death of
Jimmy Mubenga, who was killed
while being deported to Angola, as
well as the death of 15-year-old
Gareth Myatt, who was killed while
being restrained at a youth deten
tion center.

Additionally, G4S operates pris
ons, detention and interrogation
centers in Israel and the Occupied
Palestinian Territories, which hold
more than 5,000 political prisoners,
173 children and 180 people in in
definite detainment. In one case,
Arafat Jaradat died from torture in
a G4S-secured detention center in
2013. G4S also operates the world's
second-largest private prison in
South Africa, which is currently
under investigation for using forced
injections and shock therapy to
subdue inmates. The company vio
lates international labor codes by
paying substandard wages and
using racist language and policies
against employees in Malawi,
Mozambique and South Africa,
