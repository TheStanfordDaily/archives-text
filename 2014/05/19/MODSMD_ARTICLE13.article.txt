# OP-ED
## Dominatrices: MIA 
### Lily Zheng 
At first I definitely didn't look
for kink or BDSM on the Inter
netâ€” I wasn't good enough
with the Internet to know what pop
up blockers were, and I'm pretty sure
Google Chrome wasn't even around
at the time.
But whatever the reason, when a
black-clad woman with a sneer on her
face and a whip in her hand popped
up onto my screen, I didn't even no
tice the person she was whipping. My
first thought was: ivlioa.
The image of the "dominatrix" in
our minds gets more and more de
tailed as we grow up, whether or not
we find ourselves involved with kink.
Dark red or black lipstick, form-fit
ting black leather or latex gloves, a vi
cious-looking riding crop or flogger,
high heels especially the high
heels you're probably imagining
something right now, aren't you?
Porn and other sensationalist
media does a very good job of paint
ing the character of a seductive,
sadistic woman, dominant in her ac
tions and desires. At her feet is a rich,
white man some politician or
other man in a position of power

trussed up like a pig, a ball gag in his
mouth. Usually it looks like he's en
joying himself, almost comically so,
begging for the punishment or disci
pline that the dominatrix can give
him.
When I joined the Bay Area kink
community around October, I honest
ly thought I would see more of that. It
seemed an empowering stereotype
for women; in the Bay Area, arguably
one of the more progressive environ
ments in America, shouldn't there be
truckloads of dominant women? Too
many to go around? So many domina
trices (and that is the plural, for
those wondering) that they resort to
whipping the floor out of boredom?
But go to the Citadel play floor on
any given night and you'll see maybe
one dominant woman, maybe two.
They won't be wearing high heels,
aren't done up in heavy makeup and,
if you asked, would make a face at you
if you mention the word "domina
trix." Them partners in the scene are
typically them Mends, play partners
or romantic interests not a politi-

cian to be seen.
There are so few of them..
Eight months later, and I can
still count the dominant
women I know on the fingers
of one hand, and none of
them identify as a dominatrix.
Why?
Outside the scene, it is in
credibly hard for a woman to
assert power of any kind. In
the workplace, in politics, in
the household women
rarely have spaces where they
make the decisions, where
they call the shots and where
they get the moment they ask
for it. It's hard being dominant
when there are so few role
models, and that's exactly
where the dominatrix stereo
type comes in. Many domi

nant women take a look at the
common perception of a "dom
inatrix," look back at them
selves and feel at a loss. It's
like a thousand people all sit
down to take a midterm, and
no one has any instructions on
what to do.

To be honest, that's what
happened to me. I didn't know
how to be dominant, but I
could be a hardcore submis
sive like no one's business and
felt happy enough there to
stop exploring. "I'm a woman
good at submission," I
thought, and was satisfied at
first. But purely by chance, I
found myself negotiating my
way into a dominant role one
night (remind me to tell you
that story some day) and was
too excited to think about my
complete lack of experience.
We finished negotiating, I
looked my partner in the eye,
and swallowed nervously be
fore reaching for my flogger.

Long story short, I don't
identify as exclusively sub
missive any more.
I've found over time that
there are many, many types of
dominant women and
there are definitely trends,
definitely a few rules on how
to be a dominant woman.
1. Be dominant.
2. Be a woman.
Every community has
their idea of the "dominatrix;"
every woman has their own
dominatrix to deal with. For
the working women, it's
seemingly blazers and power
suits and cold, feminine-shun
ning machines who make it
big, are snappy with the chil
dren and smile only when
they get their paycheck. For
the queer women, it's sharp
mouthed balls of activist ener
gy decked out in combat
boots, leather vests and tat
toos.
But the reality is that none

of these "dominatrices" are as
common as we think they are.
There are few rules for being
a dominant woman, remem
ber?
No matter what communi
ties you may find yourselves
in ethnic, occupational,
gendered, religious you'll
find ideas of what it means to
"look" tough, stereotypes that
represent one model but not
the only model. If you're lost,
I suggest trying some differ
ent kind of clothing for size: If
it doesn't fit, toss it aside and
go on finding your strength.
This is for all you women out
there not just kinky folk!
Dominant or not, there are no
rules on how to be you.
(Though let me be honest:
It's pretty hard to whip some
one while wearing heels
messes with your balance.)
