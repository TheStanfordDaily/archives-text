# OP-ED
## Dominatrices: MIA 
### Lily Zheng 
At first I definitely didn't look
for kink or BDSM on the Inter
netâ€” I wasn't good enough
with the Internet to know what pop
up blockers were, and I'm pretty sure
Google Chrome wasn't even around
at the time.
But whatever the reason, when a
black-clad woman with a sneer on her
face and a whip in her hand popped
up onto my screen, I didn't even no
tice the person she was whipping. My
first thought was: ivlioa.
The image of the "dominatrix" in
our minds gets more and more de

we find ourselves involved with kink.
Dark red or black lipstick, form-fit

seemed an empowering stereotype
for women; in the Bay Area, arguably
one of the more progressive environ
ments in America, shouldn't there be
truckloads of dominant women? Too
many to go around? So many domina
trices (and that is the plural, for
those wondering) that they resort to
whipping the floor out of boredom?
But go to the Citadel play floor on
any given night and you'll see maybe
one dominant woman, maybe two.
They won't be wearing high heels,
aren't done up in heavy makeup and,
if you asked, would make a face at you
if you mention the word "domina
trix." Them partners in the scene are
typically them Mends, play partners
