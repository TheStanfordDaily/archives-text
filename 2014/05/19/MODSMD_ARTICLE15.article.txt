## The
						Rutgers controversy in retrospect: Gates, Bloomberg and Petraeus 
### Winston Shi 
u 7"ou and your fellow stu-
Y dents ... are therefore to
.1. be congi'atulated for your
involvement in the excellent work of
bringing back the Middle Ages,"
Yale Law School professor Stephen
Carter '76 wrote last Thursday. In
his acidly penned "Dear Class of
2014: Thanks for Not Disinviting
Me," Carter responded to contro
versies at Rutgers University and
Smith College over the selections of
Condoleezza Rice and Christine La
garde as their commencement
speakers. (Ditto for Haverford Col
lege and Robert Birgenau.) A for
mer managing editor of The Stan
ford Daily, one imagines that Carter
would be amused to see that his
piece has relevance to Stanford as
well.
This isn't to say, mind you, that
Bill and Melinda Gates are in any
danger of having their Stanford invi
tations rescinded, or that Stanford is
a university whose students and fac
ulty are actively opposing, in
Carter's view, "tolerance and open
mindedness." It is both instructive
and in a sense heartening to see that
the Stanford students involved in
the Gates Foundation, Divest from
G4S organization are not disputing
the Gates' right to speak on June 15,
but merely the Foundation's invest
ments.
That attitude is reflected in the

student body's reaction to other
speakers on campus. While it was
uncomfortable to sit in Cemex Audi
torium while a protestor screamed
at General David Petraeus for al
legedly committing war crimes, the
anti-Petraeus movement remained
an isolated event. The line to see the
General speak let alone the silent
majority that supported his visit
was considerably longer than the
line of protestors that had gathered
to bury him. And while Daily colum
nist Taylor Brady was every bit as
critical as Carter in his condemna
tion of last year's commencement
speaker Michael Bloomberg, he did
not go so far as to call in The Daily
for Bloomberg to be axed.
But even though Stanford stu
dents may not be reacting viciously
to Mr. and Mrs. Gates, Carter's
point is one worth dwelling on.
What is the point of a commence
ment speech? And what does that
mean about the people who should
be invited to deliver them?
"Commencement should be a
time of joyous celebration for the
graduates and their families," Rice
kindly wrote as she withdrew from
the Rutgers commencement. La
garde responded with similar grace.
And commencement does mean a
lot for the students; the completion
of an undergraduate education has
a certain importance in our culture
that is replicated nowhere else.
In a country where 32 percent of
the over-25 population has a bache
lor's degree and completing college
is considered the gateway to the
middle class, high school is not con
sidered enough education, while ad
vanced degrees though increas
ingly critical do not embody the
same kind of social leap. Going to
college is part of the modern Amer
ican Dream. For that reason, many
students contend, commencement
speeches are about the people who
are commencing the rest of their
lives that is to say, themselves.
That argument has been extend
ed to the recent spate of commence
ment revolts. A speaker, Rice's op
ponents at Rutgers contended,
should represent and articulate not
just the values but also the actions

that the students choose. I would
argue that Professor Rice has rep
resented and articulated these val
ues and actions. Yet it's clear that
enough students (although not nec
essarily a majority) at Rutgers dis
agree to the point that Rice felt that
she would be a distraction to the cer
emonies as a whole.
That is a shame. At the very
least, Rice would say something
worth hearing. Commencement is
for students, that is true. But Stan
ford invites people like Michael
Bloomberg and David Petraeus and
Bill and Melinda Gates to campus so
that they can spread wisdom, not
celebrate who we are. Professor
Rice's decision to withdraw was, as
The Daily Beast's Kristen Ander
son explained, the "regrettable
right thing."
♦ ♦♦
What should we make of Profes
sor Carter's righteous anger? Cer
tainly and Carter is wise to avoid
implying this students at Rut
gers, Smith or Haverford did not re
ject their commencement speakers
because such speakers would say
things at the ceremony that they did
not want to hear. Rather, students
are aware that giving a commence
ment speech confers a certain legiti
macy on its speaker that, as with the
completion of college itself, is diffi
cult to replicate. Professor Rice does
not need to speak at Rutgers or
Smith or Haverford or Stanford to
enhance her own reputation, but
speaking at these schools
whether intentional or not would
imply those schools' own support of
her. That's why these honors matter
so much. As Harvard's James
Bryant Conant pointed out:
"In terms of the immediacy of po
litical and military history, it is in
comprehensible, for example, why in
the days of the English civil wars the
victorious generals of the parliamen
tary armies, Fairfax and Cromwell,
should take the trouble to journey to
Oxford to receive the degrees of Doc
tors of Laws, honoris causa, par
ticularly incomprehensible when as
a contemporary wit remarked they
had already made themselves 'Mas
ters of Laws' by force of arms."
I understand that there are
many people who would want to
deny others that kind of legitimacy.
But how, then, do we determine who
gets through and who gets denied?
There was no majoritarian referen-
