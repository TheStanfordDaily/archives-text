### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
Needing a series sweep to contin
ue to establish its case for a postsea
son berth, Stanford baseball fell
short of that goal this weekend
against Washington State (23-27,13-
14 Pac-12), putting itself into a state
of limbo regarding its position in the
national ranks. In the team's final
regular season series at Sunken Dia
mond, in front a combined audience
of 7,561 the largest crowd for a
three-game series this year
the Cardinal (26-23, 13-14) took the
first two games of the series, 5-2 and
9-4, but dropped Sunday's matchup,
10-1.

"Anytime you have a chance to
sweep a team, especially in the Pac,
it's important to do that," said senior
third baseman Alex Blandino.
"Today, we came out and were hit
ting some balls hard right at people,
which didn't really fall our way. It
was a close game there for a little bit
but we let it get away. It's tough to
drop a Sunday game, but we'll be
back at it tomorrow."

While sophomore starting pitch
er Logan James had another strong
outing, allowing just two runs over
seven innings, the Cardinal offense
could not get anything going against
Cougars junior starting pitcher Tan
ner Chleborad. Over seven innings,
Chleborad allowed just three hits
and one run, inducing 11 ground
balls and striking out four along the
way. Stanford stranded six runners
on base in the game and went 0-for
-6 with runners in scoring position.

deficit in the top of the eighth after

GAME NOTES: Although Stanford's postsea
son hopes grew ever slimmer with its tough
loss to Washington State in Sunday's series
finale, the Cardinal will look to continue to
push their case and end the regular-season
home schedule with a flourish against Pa
cific in their final weekday non-conference
matchup of the season. Stanford will likely
need to win all four of its remaining games
to stay on the tournament bubble.

throwing 117 pitches, the Cardinal
bullpen imploded, perhaps along
with the team's playoff chances.
Washington State blew open the
game with a five-run eighth inning

and a three-run ninth inning, with
all of the runs coming off of fresh
men relievers who could not find the
plate. Chris Castellanos, Tyler
Thorne, Chris Viall and Griffin Weir
combined to throw just 44 percent
of their pitches for strikes and al
lowed six runs on six hits and three
walks, as the Cougars took a 10-1
advantage to salvage the final game
of the series.

However, Stanford dominated
the first two games of the series, both
at the plate and on the mound. Fresh
man Cal Quantrill allowed just one
run over eight innings on Fireworks
Night on Friday, and junior John
Hochstatter earned his sixth consec
utive win as he battled through 6.1
innings and allowed three runs on
Dean Stotz Day on Saturday. The
starting rotation of Quantrill,
Hochstatter and James has been
dominant over the last four weekend
series, as they've combined for an 8-
2 record and a 2.71 ERA over their
last 11 starts.

"We've really gotten good start
ing pitching, and that's why we've
been able to win two out of three
these past weekends," said head
coach Mark Marquess.
"It's been huge having two
guys like that have come out and
solidified their spots in the start
ing roles," Blandino said. "I was
really impressed with [Hochstat
ter] yesterday. I don't think he had
quite his best stuff compared to his
other starts of late he'll be the
first one to tell you that but he
battled and gave us a great start.
Same thing with Logan James. He
struggled at first to find the zone a
little bit but he put together a pretty

darn good start."
On Friday, Stanford got out to an
early 2-0 lead thanks to two RBIs
from Blandino on a first-inning sac
rifice fly and a third-inning double.
A few innings later, sophomore
Zach Hoffpauir continued his hot
streak with a two-run homer to left
field in the bottom of the sixth, giv
ing the Cardinal a 4-1 lead that
they would protect for the rest of
the game.
The offensive production on Sat
urday came in the form of three long
balls from junior Wayne Taylor,
freshman Tommy Edman and
Blandino. Overall in the series,
Blandino went 5-for-8 with five RBIs
and two runs scored, also extending
a career-long reaching-base streak
to 19 consecutive games. Junior
Austin Slater also extended a career

long hitting streak to 13 games, a
span in which he has hit .472 (25-for
-53) and has raised his season batting
average to a team-high .348.
Stanford now faces four must-win
games in its final week of the season,
which kicks off tonight at Sunken Di
amond against Pacific in a rematch
from April 29, a contest in which
Stanford squeaked out a 3-2 win.
First pitch for the team's final home
game is set for 5:30 p.m.
"We have a chance [at the post
season], It's just a matter of other
factors that really are out of our con
trol," Marquess said. "But what we
can control is that we have four
games left, so hopefully we can win a
few of them."

Junior outfielder Austin Slater (above) extended his career-long hitting
streak to 13 games on Sunday with a 2-for-4 performance at the plate,
raising his season batting average to a team-leading .348 mark.
Needing a series sweep to contin
ue to establish its case for a postsea
son berth, Stanford baseball fell
short of that goal this weekend
against Washington State (23-27,13-
14 Pac-12), putting itself into a state
of limbo regarding its position in the
national ranks. In the team's final
regular season series at Sunken Dia
mond, in front a combined audience
of 7,561 the largest crowd for a
three-game series this year
the Cardinal (26-23, 13-14) took the
first two games of the series, 5-2 and
9-4, but dropped Sunday's matchup,
10-1.

"Anytime you have a chance to
sweep a team, especially in the Pac,
it's important to do that," said senior
third baseman Alex Blandino.
"Today, we came out and were hit
ting some balls hard right at people,
which didn't really fall our way. It
was a close game there for a little bit
but we let it get away. It's tough to
drop a Sunday game, but we'll be
back at it tomorrow."

While sophomore starting pitch
er Logan James had another strong
outing, allowing just two runs over
seven innings, the Cardinal offense
could not get anything going against
Cougars junior starting pitcher Tan
ner Chleborad. Over seven innings,
Chleborad allowed just three hits
and one run, inducing 11 ground
balls and striking out four along the
way. Stanford stranded six runners
on base in the game and went 0-for
-6 with runners in scoring position.

deficit in the top of the eighth after

GAME NOTES: Although Stanford's postsea
son hopes grew ever slimmer with its tough
loss to Washington State in Sunday's series
finale, the Cardinal will look to continue to
push their case and end the regular-season
home schedule with a flourish against Pa
cific in their final weekday non-conference
matchup of the season. Stanford will likely
need to win all four of its remaining games
to stay on the tournament bubble.

throwing 117 pitches, the Cardinal
bullpen imploded, perhaps along
with the team's playoff chances.
Washington State blew open the
game with a five-run eighth inning

and a three-run ninth inning, with
all of the runs coming off of fresh
men relievers who could not find the
plate. Chris Castellanos, Tyler
Thorne, Chris Viall and Griffin Weir
combined to throw just 44 percent
of their pitches for strikes and al
lowed six runs on six hits and three
walks, as the Cougars took a 10-1
advantage to salvage the final game
of the series.

However, Stanford dominated
the first two games of the series, both
at the plate and on the mound. Fresh
man Cal Quantrill allowed just one
run over eight innings on Fireworks
Night on Friday, and junior John
Hochstatter earned his sixth consec
utive win as he battled through 6.1
innings and allowed three runs on
Dean Stotz Day on Saturday. The
starting rotation of Quantrill,
Hochstatter and James has been
dominant over the last four weekend
series, as they've combined for an 8-
2 record and a 2.71 ERA over their
last 11 starts.

"We've really gotten good start
ing pitching, and that's why we've
been able to win two out of three
these past weekends," said head
coach Mark Marquess.
"It's been huge having two
guys like that have come out and
solidified their spots in the start
ing roles," Blandino said. "I was
really impressed with [Hochstat
ter] yesterday. I don't think he had
quite his best stuff compared to his
other starts of late he'll be the
first one to tell you that but he
battled and gave us a great start.
Same thing with Logan James. He
struggled at first to find the zone a
little bit but he put together a pretty

darn good start."
On Friday, Stanford got out to an
early 2-0 lead thanks to two RBIs
from Blandino on a first-inning sac
rifice fly and a third-inning double.
A few innings later, sophomore
Zach Hoffpauir continued his hot
streak with a two-run homer to left
field in the bottom of the sixth, giv
ing the Cardinal a 4-1 lead that
they would protect for the rest of
the game.
The offensive production on Sat
urday came in the form of three long
balls from junior Wayne Taylor,
freshman Tommy Edman and
Blandino. Overall in the series,
Blandino went 5-for-8 with five RBIs
and two runs scored, also extending
a career-long reaching-base streak
to 19 consecutive games. Junior
Austin Slater also extended a career

long hitting streak to 13 games, a
span in which he has hit .472 (25-for
-53) and has raised his season batting
average to a team-high .348.
Stanford now faces four must-win
games in its final week of the season,
which kicks off tonight at Sunken Di
amond against Pacific in a rematch
from April 29, a contest in which
Stanford squeaked out a 3-2 win.
First pitch for the team's final home
game is set for 5:30 p.m.
"We have a chance [at the post
season], It's just a matter of other
factors that really are out of our con
trol," Marquess said. "But what we
can control is that we have four
games left, so hopefully we can win a
few of them."
