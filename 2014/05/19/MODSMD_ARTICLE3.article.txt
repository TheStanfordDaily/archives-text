# SPEAKERS & EVENTS
## Defectors share their escape stories 
### SHUBHA RAGHVENDRA 
Two North Korean defec
tors, Sungju Lee and Seongmin
Lee, spoke about their child
hood experiences as citizens of
the Democratic People's Re
public of Korea (DPRK) as part
of a panel sponsored by the Ko
rean Students' Association last
Friday.
The panel was organized by
Joon Kee Park 'l7, who crossed
paths with both panelists while
working with a human rights or

ganization in Seoul.
At first blush, the two defec
tors have much in common:
Both were born in North Korea,
both crossed the Korean-Chi
nese border to freedom as
young adults and both are
presently pursuing undergrad
uate degrees in Seoul. Yet they
followed very different trajecto
ries to their present lives in
South Korea.
Sungju and his family's stan
dard of living departed notice-
ably from the narrative most tell
about North Korea his father
was an official in Kim 11-Sung's per
sonal military guard, and Sungju
lived with his family in relative af
fluence in Pyongyang, the North
Korean capital, owning a luxurious
house and an imported car.
"While in Pyongyang, I thought
North Korea was wonderful,"
Sungju said. "It was the best coun
try in the world."
However, the events that fol
lowed Sungju's early childhood
would radically alter both his
lifestyle and his perspective on his
home country.
When Sungju was 10, in 1994,
Kim Jung II dismissed his prede
cessor's military guard and
Sungju's family, impoverished as a
result, moved to the countryside in
the north. There, they foraged for
food in the foothills of nearby
mountains, surviving on pine tree
bark and snakes. ("Good for pro
tein!" Sungju said, laughing.)
When food grew so scarce that
survival seemed unlikely, his par
ents, driven to desperation, left
home to search for food in China.
Left alone and without any source
of food, Sungju took to the streets.
He joined a group of seven
teenage boys to beg for and steal
food from local merchants.

"We became like little gang
sters," Sungju said. "Stealing be
came my job."
In an incredible turn of events,
soon after Sungju turned 16, he
encountered his maternal grand
father at a train station an oc
currence that he now calls a mira
cle. After moving with his grandfa
ther to his family farm, an agent
hired by his father, who had by
then escaped to China, arrived at
his grandfather's farm to deliver
Sungju across the border to China.
Sungju only found out after
ward that such an operation re
quired approximately $20,000 in
bribes from his father. On Friday,
Sungju described the reunion with
his father as the most emotional
experience of his life.
For Sungju, much about leav
ing North Korea has been an ad
justment the language was dif
ferent, and initially, even consider
ing that North Korea was not the
greatest country on Earth was a
perplexing prospect.
He closed by describing his
dream for the future of the Koreas
to the audience.
"I hope to be there to unite
North and South Korea someday,"
Sungju said.
In contrast, the younger pan
elist, Seongmin, experienced a
vastly different journey to China.

While Sungju's departure from
DPRK was sudden and drastic,
Seongmin left the nation gradual
ly, escaping from and returning to
his home country several times
since the age of 13.
Seongmin described an image
that crystallized the distinction he
observed between the two coun
tries on either side of the border.
At night, China was brightly lit,
illuminated by the electricity that
country's government provided to
its citizens, while North Korea was
pitch dark, he said.
This was the first sense Seong
min had of the opportunity that lay
across the border, and it was then,
at the age of 13, that he began his
smuggling business, beginning
with his very first smuggled good
a puppy, bought in North Korea
and sold for a higher price in
China.
Over the next few years,
Seongmin lived what he described
as a life full of "adventure," and he
irreverently persisted in his
smuggling operation despite raids
of his home, warnings from law en
forcement officers and stints in
prison.
Eventually, he was able to accu
mulate enough money to bribe his
way across the border in much the
same way as Sungju's father had
paid. Seongmin recounted paying
off border agents, airport workers
and police officers to make his way
safely to China, and then eventual
ly South Korea.
Seongmin closed by pleading
with the audience to bring aware
ness about the depth of human
rights abuse in North Korea to the
international community.
His strong belief is that tech
nology which is gradually seeping
across the border into North
Korea, will bring information that
will help young North Koreans
"distinguish between true and
false, and then choose their own
way" in aligning with or against the
regime of Kim Jung Un.
