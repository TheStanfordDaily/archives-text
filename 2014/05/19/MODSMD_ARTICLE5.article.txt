# Ike's Place sacked
## RFP cites survey results; students angry with process 
### EDWARD NGAI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Four years after establishing it
self as a campus landmark, Ike's
Place is leaving.
Last Friday, students gathered
in White Plaza for a "Save Ike's"
rally, handing out over 200 Ike's
sandwiches in less than 15 minutes.
The demonstration followed the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate's
unanimous resolution in support of
Ike's Place on May 6.
The protests and ASSU resolu
tion come on the heels of Ike's
drawn-out departure from the
Forbes Family Cafe in the Jen-Hsun
Huang Engineering Center in the
Science and Engineering Quad
(SEQ), where owner Ike Shehadeh
had opened with much fanfare in
2009. Ike's Place will remain open
until June 15, but in the meantime, a
group of more than 50 students call
ing themselves "Ike's Army" have
distributed fliers across campus de
manding that the bustling sandwich
shop return next year.
On April 25, the University an
nounced that Ike's Place will be re
placed by an eatery operated by
Stanford Residential and Dining
Enterprises (R&DE) in September.
R&DE has not yet announced the
details of its winning restaurant con
cept. In the meantime, students
have been left to wonder how the de
cision to award the contract was
made, who made it and why.
Ultimately, the decision was
made by the Forbes Family Cafe Re
quest for Proposal (RFP) Commit
tee a group of six staff members,
no faculty, one graduate student and
one undergraduate student operat
ing in close coordination with Lind
sey Akin, services manager for the
Science and Engineering Quad. Uni
versity officials have refused to re
lease the names of any committee
members, claiming that they are
confidential.
The use of confidential commit
tees for RFPs is standard practice.
In February 2009, such a committee
was responsible for finding the
Forbes Family Cafe's first tenant,
contacting 13 vendors before unani
mously awarding Shehadeh the con
tract from 2010 to 2013, with an op
tion to extend for another three
