# Ike's Place sacked
## RFP cites survey results; students angry with process 
### EDWARD NGAI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Four years after establishing it
self as a campus landmark, Ike's
Place is leaving.
Last Friday, students gathered
in White Plaza for a "Save Ike's"
rally, handing out over 200 Ike's
sandwiches in less than 15 minutes.
The demonstration followed the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate's
unanimous resolution in support of
Ike's Place on May 6.
The protests and ASSU resolu
tion come on the heels of Ike's
drawn-out departure from the
Forbes Family Cafe in the Jen-Hsun
Huang Engineering Center in the
Science and Engineering Quad
(SEQ), where owner Ike Shehadeh
had opened with much fanfare in
2009. Ike's Place will remain open
until June 15, but in the meantime, a
group of more than 50 students call
ing themselves "Ike's Army" have
distributed fliers across campus de
manding that the bustling sandwich
shop return next year.
On April 25, the University an
nounced that Ike's Place will be re
placed by an eatery operated by
Stanford Residential and Dining
Enterprises (R&DE) in September.
R&DE has not yet announced the
details of its winning restaurant con
cept. In the meantime, students
have been left to wonder how the de
cision to award the contract was
made, who made it and why.
Ultimately, the decision was
made by the Forbes Family Cafe Re
quest for Proposal (RFP) Commit
tee a group of six staff members,
no faculty, one graduate student and
one undergraduate student operat
ing in close coordination with Lind
sey Akin, services manager for the
Science and Engineering Quad. Uni
versity officials have refused to re
lease the names of any committee
members, claiming that they are
confidential.
The use of confidential commit
tees for RFPs is standard practice.
In February 2009, such a committee
was responsible for finding the
Forbes Family Cafe's first tenant,
contacting 13 vendors before unani
mously awarding Shehadeh the con
tract from 2010 to 2013, with an op
tion to extend for another three

years afterwards.
In September 2012, when She
hadeh stepped back from manage
ment of the Stanford location, Stan
ford exercised a limited option to ex
tend the Ike's Place lease for one
more year, until June 2014.
This particular process is not
under scrutiny because of wrongdo
ing by any department certainly
not by R&DE, whose role in this
process is peripheral. It is under
scrutiny because of how the RFPs,
faithfully administered by adminis
trators and officials according to
University guidelines and in good
faith, could reach such universally
unpopular decisions.
Requests for a new proposal
In October 2013, just as Ike's was
beginning its last academic year of
operations in Huang, the Stanford
Purchasing and Contracts office
opened the Forbes Family Cafe case
for bidding. The next month, Akin,
the point person for the contract,
disseminated a food services survey
that would be used as part of the
RFP Committee's evaluation crite
ria. The Committee then chose 16
local businesses to invite for a tour of
the Forbes Family Cafe.
On Dec. 17, 2013, representa
tives from the invited vendors at
tended a "bid walk" at the Huang
Engineering Center. Several ven
dors, including big-name chains like
Chipotle and Pizza My Heart, were
unable to seriously consider a bid
because of the Forbes Family Cafe's
limited kitchen space.
Only three vendors Coupa
Cafe, Ike's Place and R&DE
made formal bid presentations dur
ing the week of Feb. 24.
"The majority [of potential ven
dors] saw how small the space was
and said, 'We're not interested,"'
said Troy Sutton, the contracts man
ager at the Stanford purchasing de
partment. "People walked away.
They participated, but they weren't
interested in submitting a propos
al."
So by March, when the Commit
tee met to deliberate the awarding
of the lease, comparing the three op
tions.
According to a partial list of cri
teria obtained by The Daily, commit

tee members were asked to rate
each vendor's bid on the following
factors: variety of menu, seasonality,
pricing, sustainability, staff benefits
and turnover, wait times, company
reputation and prior experience.
Akin said that content for the bid
presentations was confidential. But
she claimed that R&DE's bid was
the only one that not only addressed
each of these criteria but also went
"above and beyond." According to
Akin, R&DE was the only vendor
with the foresight to delineate
changes to their employee benefits
because of the Affordable Care Act,
for example.
"R&DE proposed a seasonal, af
fordable menu built around sustain
able and local food," Akin said.
"Their proposal was all about sourc
ing locally with everything they
serve."
Questioning the survey
Part of the bid process was the
survey disseminated by Akin to var
ious science and engineering-relat
ed e-mail lists in November 2013,
called "Food in the SEQ." The sur
vey was intended to gauge commu
nity opinion on food options and
serve as the foundation for evalua
tion criteria during the RFP
process; a press release announcing
R&DE's successful bid on April 25
prominently featured the survey re
sults.
However, the survey has been
widely criticized by students as
being biased against Ike's, and

many of the survey's 900 respon
dents are now upset because their
responses are being cited to justify
Ike's' departure.
Most of the survey respondents
interviewed by The Daily said that
their response should have indicat
ed support for Ike's to continue op
erating.

"If I had known it was a choice
between Ike's and anything else, I
would have made it very clear that I
wanted Ike's," said lan Holmes 'l5,
a survey respondent. "The survey
was so deceiving, it should be invali
dated."

"I would describe the survey as
designed to answer a question other
than the one it was used to answer,"
said Emily Grubert 'O9, a doctoral
student in Earth Sciences. "My per
ception ... was that the specific ques
tions seemed to focus on particular
elements that Ike's was certain to
score poorly on."
The six-question survey asked
respondents about desired price
range, wait time and selection for a
food vendor at the Forbes Family
Cafe.

Multiple respondents identified
one specific question that they felt
was biased against Ike's: "What do
you think is a reasonable and realis
tic amount of time to wait, starting
with getting in line up until the food
is ready and 'in your hand?"'
Akin and Jamie Beckett, director
of communications and alumni rela
tions at the Stanford School of Engi
neering, have repeatedly cited long
wait times as a complaint about Ike's
despite the restaurant's efforts to
improve speed of service, like imple
menting an order-ahead/grab-and
go system.
Two students also complained
that language at the top of the sur
vey suggested that the RFP was a
legally mandated formality and mis
led them to believe that Ike's was in
no real danger.
"For legal reasons, we have to in
vite several businesses, not just
Ike's, to bid," the survey read.
Allegations that the survey was
an inaccurate representation of stu
dent opinion spread across major
campus e-mail lists on April 28 and
29. A new survey, fielded by Andrew
Aude 'l6, asked respondents
whether they would prefer Ike's or
R&DE to operate in the SEQ next
year.
In this survey, more than 97 per
cent of respondents in a sample
almost four times the size of the
RFP Committee's indicated that
they would like Ike's to continue op
erating next year.
Beckett maintained that the risk

of Ike's Place losing its lease was al
ways implicit in the RFP Commit
tee's survey.

"I don't understand how that
could not be understood [by respon
dents]," she said. "If a contract is
coming up, which the survey says,
then there is always a chance that
the business could lose it."

Sutton, responsible for ensuring
Stanford's RFP processes occur
legally and transparently, stressed
the importance of defining the goal
of the survey process.
"Depending on how you phrase
the question, you're going to make
people look happy or unhappy," he
said.

Akin, who was responsible for
creating, disseminating and analyz
ing the survey, declined to acknowl
edge any problems with the sur
vey's design or how its recommen
dations were used in the RFP Com
mittee's deliberations.
"Given that it went out to the
whole SEQ population and we got so
many results back, I can only as
sume it was valid," she said.
Why Ike's is really leaving
Much has been made of the confi
dential identities of the RFP Com
mittee and problems with its com
munity opinion survey, but the reali
ty is that the Committee had little
choice in the matter of who would be
awarded the Forbes Family Cafe
contract.
Because of Ike's Place's past
"business" issues in dealing with the
University, they were not a competi
tive bidder in the Committee's delib
erations. These issues also played a
role in the School of Engineering's
decision to only partially exercise an
option to keep Ike's Place operating
past June.
The decision that set off the
multi-office RFP process was made
in September 2012, when officials
from the School of Engineering and
the SEQ decided to option the
Forbes Family Cafe lease for one out
of the three possible years.
According to Akin, the decision
to extend for only a year was based
on "various persistent issues," citing
a range of past problems including
long lines, loud music and alleged
"vulgarities" used by Ike's employ
ees at work.
None of the officials contacted
for this article could comment on the
specifics of these "business" or "fa
cilities" issues.
When asked how loud music or
casually dressed employees were
grounds to replace a business on
campus, Akin replied, "We have
deans and donors eating here."
These "persistent issues" likely
played a significant part in the deci
sion to award the Forbes Family
Cafe contract to a vendor other than
Ike's. As SEQ services manager,
Akin briefed the RFP Committee on
the University's dealings with Ike's
since 2009, and according to Sutton,
the bid process included specific
questions posed to each vendor that
addressed client needs and con
cerns.

"Something we generally try to
do with all RFPs is wrap all the spe
cific issues into questions for all ven
dors," he said. "So if we have a ques
tion about A, we will ask 'How will
you deal with it going forward?'
'What is your proposal to deal with
B ?»>
Ike Shehadeh, the owner of Ike's
Place, acknowledges the Universi
ty's right to award the Forbes Fam
ily Cafe lease to another vendor.
However, he expressed disappoint
ment with the problems that the

University cited to justify ending
the lease.
"My understanding of all the is
sues were that they were little is
sues," he said. "As far as I know, they
were unhappy with what we were
doing, pretty much from the first
day that we got there. If we were
Starbucks, they wouldn't kick Star
bucks out over this."
A lesson from Ike's
The opacity of the RFP process
has amplified the uncertainty and
misinformation surrounding Ike's'
departure. It remains true that the
only people who know the content of
the relevant bids are the eight confi
dential committee members and the
administrators who have worked on
the lease.
Additionally, despite repeated in
quiries, officials at multiple Univer
sity departments have rebuffed at
tempts to view the contents of the
bids, the supplementary materials
provided to the Committee to help
evaluate the candidate vendors and
the full list of evaluation criteria.
Despite the fact that no student
consultative mechanism was re
quired to inform the committee,
Akin determined that fielding a sur
vey was in the best interests of the
community. However, the poor sur
vey design has opened up the RFP
process to accusations of pro-R&DE
bias. No evidence exists to substanti
ate that charge, but obvious deficien
cies in survey methodology and
analysis like the refusal to dis
seminate the raw data and adminis
trators' disinterest in finding the
survey response rate are at best
inept and at worst dishonest.
Finally, the RFP process at Stan
ford remains opaque and unrepre
sentative. In an open letter to Uni
versity President John Hennessy,
ASSU Senator John-Lancaster Fin
ley 'l6 argued that the RFP Com
mittee and its decisions were uncon
stitutional according to Article I,
Section 5.A of the ASSU Constitu
tion, which stipulates that only the
ASSU can designate students to rep
resent the student body.
"[Hennessy's] response to me
was that although he was sympa
thetic to the issue I raised, the Uni
versity is not bound by the constitu
tion or its agreement to students,"
Finley said. "He told me to talk to his
legal counsel."
Akin also acknowledged the im
portance of gathering community
opinion despite the fact that it was not
necessitated by any policy or rule.
"It's going to be a good idea to get
student opinion," she said of her pri
orities in organizing the Forbes
Family Cafe RFP "If Ike's just left,
and no one was consulted, there
would be a revolt."
