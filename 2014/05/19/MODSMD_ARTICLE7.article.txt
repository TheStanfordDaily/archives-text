## No magic for Sharks without familiar faces 
### Joseph Beyda 
It's not easy to say goodbye
especially not to an NHL sea
son. That's what I was forced to
do two weeks ago when my
beloved San Jose Sharks
choked so historically that even I was
left without excuses.
But now the Sharks' ownership is
applying the proverbial Heimlich as it
gears up for the future, and I'm discov
ering that saying goodbye to an NHL
player or two may be even harder.
After the team made the expected
announcement that it was dumping
the aging Dan Boyle and the clumsy
Martin Havlat, the sense is growing
that its two star veterans, Patrick
Marleau and Joe Thornton, may soon
be out the door as well. Both Marleau
and Thornton are likely Hall of
Famers once they retire, yet neither
has won a Stanley Cup and both were
among the Sharks' most deflated play
ers over the last three games of the
team's first-round collapse.
Turnover is deeply engrained in
professional sports, of course, and I'm
more than used to memorizing new
faces and numbers each season. As a
Giants fan, I thoroughly enjoyed my
2012 one-night stand with Melky
Cabrera, testosterone-infused as it
may have been.

But it's something else entirely to
potentially bid adieu to the two faces of
the Sharks franchise, a pair of cap
tains (Marleau from 2003-09, Thorn
ton from 2010 to present) who have
played 1,922 combined games in teal.
As much as we San Jose fans want that
long-awaited Cup for ourselves, our
rallying cry over the last few playoffs
has been to win one for two of the best
hockey players in the world two
guys who simply deserved it.
And despite all of the measurable
playoff disappointment—lo straight
appearances without making the fi
nals, a first-round loss despite the
league's best regular-season record in
2008 and this year's first-round defeat
after taking a 3-0 series lead that
this franchise has experienced, it's
hard to believe that someone else may
soon wear number 12 or 19 for the
Sharks.
I can visualize every series-win
ning goal by Marleau or Thornton bet
ter than the material that I learned in
geology class last week, and I don't
know if I'll be able to let go of that.
Imagine if Andrew Luck had wanted
to come back for a fifth year, but Stan
ford hadn't let him because he had
failed to win his conference in three
seasons as the starting quarterback.
That's how it feels.
It's not the prospect of giving up
the great memories of my two favorite
hockey players; it's the concept that
the top of the Sharks organization is
trying to rob me of Marleau and
Thornton. (In this case, the top of the
Sharks organization is majority owner
Hasso Plattnei; whose name is on the
d.school at Stanford the school that
didn't accept me into a class I wanted
to take this quarter. Haven't you done
enough, Hasso?)
I would feel like I'm cheating on
Patty and Jumbo the next time I
shelled out money for tickets, and
watching that game would feel like a
family reunion without my favorite
cousins: fun, but not the same. Yeah,
hockey is a business, and yeah, tough
decisions have to be made. Yet when it
comes to nurturing a fan base that has
grown to love Marleau and Thornton
over the years, isn't there a point at
which the best on-ice decision isn't the
best business decision?
A good friend of mine—who's just
as attached to the Sharks' stars as I
am, but tends to be more pessimistic
about the team in general has told
me to take solace in the fact that trad
ing Marleau or Thornton could be a
kick in the rear end to the rest of the
locker room. It still feels like I'm being
kicked somewhere else, and who
knows whether my fellow Sharks fans
can take the pain.

Jospeh Beyda has spent the past
week doubled over in pain whenever
he thinks about losing his favorite
Sharks heroes. Email him your

ton from 2010 to present) who have
played 1,922 combined games in teal.
As much as we San Jose fans want that
long-awaited Cup for ourselves, our
rallying cry over the last few playoffs
has been to win one for two of the best
hockey players in the world two
guys who simply deserved it.
And despite all of the measurable
playoff disappointment—lo straight
appearances without making the fi
nals, a first-round loss despite the
league's best regular-season record in
2008 and this year's first-round defeat
after taking a 3-0 series lead that
this franchise has experienced, it's
hard to believe that someone else may
soon wear number 12 or 19 for the
Sharks.
I can visualize every series-win
ning goal by Marleau or Thornton bet
ter than the material that I learned in
geology class last week, and I don't
know if I'll be able to let go of that.
Imagine if Andrew Luck had wanted
to come back for a fifth year, but Stan
ford hadn't let him because he had
failed to win his conference in three
seasons as the starting quarterback.
That's how it feels.
It's not the prospect of giving up
the great memories of my two favorite
hockey players; it's the concept that
the top of the Sharks organization is
trying to rob me of Marleau and
Thornton. (In this case, the top of the
Sharks organization is majority owner
Hasso Plattnei; whose name is on the
d.school at Stanford the school that
didn't accept me into a class I wanted
to take this quarter. Haven't you done
enough, Hasso?)
I would feel like I'm cheating on
Patty and Jumbo the next time I
shelled out money for tickets, and
watching that game would feel like a
family reunion without my favorite
cousins: fun, but not the same. Yeah,
hockey is a business, and yeah, tough
decisions have to be made. Yet when it
comes to nurturing a fan base that has
grown to love Marleau and Thornton
over the years, isn't there a point at
which the best on-ice decision isn't the
best business decision?
A good friend of mine—who's just
as attached to the Sharks' stars as I
am, but tends to be more pessimistic
about the team in general has told
me to take solace in the fact that trad
ing Marleau or Thornton could be a
kick in the rear end to the rest of the
locker room. It still feels like I'm being
kicked somewhere else, and who
knows whether my fellow Sharks fans
can take the pain.

The best on-ice
decision isn't the
best business
decision.
