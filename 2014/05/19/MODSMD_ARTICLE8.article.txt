# THE
						ROAD TO A REPEAT

### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
With the win over No. 3 Virginia
in its NCAA quarterfinal match on
Saturday, No. 11 Stanford defeated
the highest-seeded team that it will
face the rest of the way in the tour
nament, regardless of how far it ad
vances. But the Cardinal will be the
first to tell you that seeding is the
least important metric in their
mind.
That's because last season, when
Stanford chugged through the tour
nament and won the national title,
the Cardinal brandished the No. 12
seed. And this year, with a Final
Four berth in hand and wins over
the No. 6 and No. 3 teams in the
tournament, Stanford is the owner
of the No. 11 seed. And not only has
the lower seeding given the Cardi
nal tougher matchups, it has also
given them increased motivation to
succeed in this tournament.
"We're letting teams know that
are seeded ahead of us that we don't
belong at 11, let's just put it that
way," said head coach Lele Forood.
The next step on that run will pit
the Cardinal (20-2, 8-2 Pac-12)
against No. 7 North Carolina (28-5,
12-2 ACC) with a berth in the na
tional title match on the line. And
while Stanford hasn't been a tradi
tional underdog with its No. 11 seed
throughout the tournament, the Tar
Heels will likely provide the stiffest
competition that the Cardinal have
seen this tournament.
It all starts on top at the number
one singles position, where Stan
ford's third-ranked Rristie Ahn will
rendezvous with the top singles
player in the country in freshman
Jamie Loeb. The sensation made an
immediate impact in the collegiate
game with her 49-2 record this sea
son and has only lost to players
ranked in the top 10. She has not yet
surrendered a single set during the
NCAA Tournament all against
ranked opponents, including two in
the top 10.
She is paired atop the singles

lineup by freshman Hayley Carter,
who is ranked as the No. 5 singles
player in the country and brings a
remarkable 45-6 record to the table
to face off with sophomore Krista
Hardebeck at number two singles.
It's certainly not a favorable draw
for Hardebeck, who has struggled
in her last two matches against the
No. 23 and No. 32 singles players in
the nation, losing both in straight
sets and only winning a combined
nine games in those four sets.
In addition, the Tar Heels bring
two of the nation's best doubles
pairings to the table, with Loeb and
Carter pairing up to form the na
tion's third-ranked duo at number

one doubles and sophomore Whit
ney Kay and junior Caroline Price
holding a No. 13 ranking.
Although the Cardinal's top two
doubles pairs are ranked lower at
No. 10 and No. 50 nationally, Ahn
and freshman Carol Zhao on court
one will be looking to take advan
tage of the recent struggles of their
counterparts from North Carolina
Loeb and Carter needed a
tiebreak to win their match in the
round of 16, while they lost their last
match in the quarterfinals against
the top pair from Alabama.
Regardless of whether the Car
dinal can get the doubles point, how
ever, the real swing in the matchup

will come from the Cardinal's youth
on the backcourts something
that will look to give Stanford an
upper hand if recent results are any
indication.

The freshman trio of Zhao, Tay
lor Davidson and Caroline Doyle
has been absolutely paramount to
the Cardinal's success this tourna
ment, with their consistency and
solid play acting as an anchor to the
back of Stanford's singles lineup
and essentially guaranteeing three
singles points for Stanford every
match.
