# ENERGY IN EUGENE
## 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
As the saying goes, what a differ
ence a year can make.
For the Stanford men's golf
team, the difference between the
2013 Columbus Regional and the
2014 Eugene Regional is the chasm
separating satisfaction and disap
pointment, victory and defeat and
most importantly moving on
and going home. This time, the Car
dinal are on the right side of the di
vide.
After tasting the bitterness of
failure at the 2013 Columbus Re
gional courtesy of its seventh-place
team finish, Stanford washed away
any residual feelings on Saturday
with a sweet victory at the Eugene
Regional Championships.
Outgoing junior Patrick
Rodgers made it a sweep of the
medalist honors for the Card, win
ning the event by six strokes and
crushing the field in the process.
The soon-to-be professional golfer
now has 11 individual wins in his il
lustrious collegiate career, tying the
program record held by Tiger

Woods. He has but one chance left to
break the tie at the NCAA
Championships. The story truly
does appear to be writing itself; des
tiny is afoot.
"Happy to advance today, great
to win our fourth tournament in a
row on a very difficult and demand
ing golf course in Eugene Country
Club," said Stanford head coach
Conrad Ray. "Neat to see Patrick
Rodgers pick up his 11th win and tie
Tiger's school record. He really had
full command of his game and creat
ed a lot of separation by hitting his
ball in the fairway a lot and putting
well. So proud of him, and it would
be neat to see him maybe break the
record at NCAAs here next week."
As in their victory at the Pac-12
Championships in late April, the
Cardinal were in control from
Thursday's first gun until the last
scorecard was signed on Saturday
afternoon. Ray's quintet shot out of
the gate with a 4-under 276 team
score in Thursday's fourth round, a
solid performance which afforded
the Card a four-shot lead over Okla
homa and a 10-stroke advantage
over third place.

Unsurprisingly, the effort was
spearheaded by Rodgers, who
turned in a marvelous 4-under 66
scorecard, which included five
birdies over a seven-hole stretch
and put him atop the individual
leaderboard a position he would
never relinquish. Sophomore David
Boote was the only other Stanford
player under par in the opening 18,
carding a 1-under 69 thanks to four
birdies on his back nine. The Card
also counted freshman Viraat Bad
hwar's even-par 70 and senior
Cameron Wilson's 1-over 71.
Friday was much of the same for
the squad, which has not lost a tour
nament since its runner-up placing
at the Southern Highlands Colle
giate Masters in early March.
Though its 2-over 282 cumulative
score didn't match its Thursday
number, Stanford still expanded its
lead over the Sooners to nine shots.
Rodgers followed up his 66 with a
four-birdie, one-bogey 3-under 67.
Wilson playing in his second-to
last NCAA event got into the red
with a steady 2-under 68 round that

put him T-2nd in the individ
ual race.
But despite the comfort
able lead, the Card knew the
tournament wasn't over until
it was truly over. Stanford was
within one shot of the lead at
last season's regional but fiz
zled out with a 14-over per
formance in the final round
that denied the team a trip to
the NCAA Championships.
Though the Cardinal simi
larly struggled in their final
round in Eugene record
ing a nearly identical third
round score to that at Colum
bus in 2013 they main
tained then- sizeable lead and
held off a hard-charging Ore
gon for the regional title.
With none of its individuals

breaking par, Saturday wit
nessed Ray's unit shoot 15-
over 295 on the veritable Eu
gene Country Club. The tum
ble, however, coupled with a
solid round from the host
Ducks, still wasn't enough to
remove Stanford from its
perch at the top.
Ultimately, the Card best
ed their Pac-12 rivals by a sin
gle stroke and defeated third
place Oklahoma by seven
shots. Rodgers' 1-over 71 was
little more than a blip as he
claimed the individual title by
six shots over Oregon's
Thomas Lim; Wilson's 3-over
74 dropped him to T-sth. Bad
hwar was the only other Car
dinal in the top 20, finishing in
a tie for 14th.

"The conditions got faster
and the hole locations more
challenging as the weekend
went on, and it was neat to
see our guys hang in there
today even though we didn't

have our best golf or best
day," Ray remarked. "Credit
to their play the first couple
days to open up that type of
lead on the course that we
did."
Saturday marked a break
in the encouraging trend of
strong final rounds the Card
have been turning in over the
course of the spring season.
If it is to capitalize on its le
gitimate shot at the national
title, Stanford must bring
its A-game whether it's the
first round or the last,
whether it's up by nine or
down 19. But Ray knows
that at this point, the
proverbial hay is in the barn
and there's no sense at
pushing his players this
deep in the season.
"The guys will have a cou
ple days to catch their breath
and then we're off to
Hutchinson, Kansas, on
Wednesday most likely," Ray

said of the team's schedule
for this week. "We'll focus on
playing in the wind a little bit
this week, keeping the ball
down and maybe doing some
match play strategy and dis
cussion, preparing for the
Final Eight, hopefully if we
get there. Overall, just keep
ing the game polished. The
guys have been in good form,
so I think a big part of our
next few days is making sure
they're well-rested and
caught up in school as well."
Stroke play at the NCAA
Championships begins Fri
day and continues through
Monday. If Stanford finishes
in the top eight after the com
pletion of stroke play, it will
move on to the match play
portion of the event, which
starts Tuesday, May 27, and
will end on May 28.

zled out with a 14-over per
formance in the final round
that denied the team a trip to
the NCAA Championships.
Though the Cardinal simi
larly struggled in their final
round in Eugene record
ing a nearly identical third
round score to that at Colum
bus in 2013 they main
tained then- sizeable lead and
held off a hard-charging Ore
gon for the regional title.
With none of its individuals

breaking par, Saturday wit
nessed Ray's unit shoot 15-
over 295 on the veritable Eu
gene Country Club. The tum
ble, however, coupled with a
solid round from the host
Ducks, still wasn't enough to
remove Stanford from its
perch at the top.
Ultimately, the Card best
ed their Pac-12 rivals by a sin
gle stroke and defeated third
place Oklahoma by seven
shots. Rodgers' 1-over 71 was
little more than a blip as he
claimed the individual title by
six shots over Oregon's
Thomas Lim; Wilson's 3-over
74 dropped him to T-sth. Bad
hwar was the only other Car
dinal in the top 20, finishing in
a tie for 14th.

"The conditions got faster
and the hole locations more
challenging as the weekend
went on, and it was neat to
see our guys hang in there
today even though we didn't

have our best golf or best
day," Ray remarked. "Credit
to their play the first couple
days to open up that type of
lead on the course that we
did."
Saturday marked a break
in the encouraging trend of
strong final rounds the Card
have been turning in over the
course of the spring season.
If it is to capitalize on its le
gitimate shot at the national
title, Stanford must bring
its A-game whether it's the
first round or the last,
whether it's up by nine or
down 19. But Ray knows
that at this point, the
proverbial hay is in the barn
and there's no sense at
pushing his players this
deep in the season.
"The guys will have a cou
ple days to catch their breath
and then we're off to
Hutchinson, Kansas, on
Wednesday most likely," Ray

said of the team's schedule
for this week. "We'll focus on
playing in the wind a little bit
this week, keeping the ball
down and maybe doing some
match play strategy and dis
cussion, preparing for the
Final Eight, hopefully if we
get there. Overall, just keep
ing the game polished. The
guys have been in good form,
so I think a big part of our
next few days is making sure
they're well-rested and
caught up in school as well."
Stroke play at the NCAA
Championships begins Fri
day and continues through
Monday. If Stanford finishes
in the top eight after the com
pletion of stroke play, it will
move on to the match play
portion of the event, which
starts Tuesday, May 27, and
will end on May 28.

As the saying goes, what a differ
ence a year can make.
For the Stanford men's golf
team, the difference between the
2013 Columbus Regional and the
2014 Eugene Regional is the chasm
separating satisfaction and disap
pointment, victory and defeat and
most importantly moving on
and going home. This time, the Car
dinal are on the right side of the di
vide.
After tasting the bitterness of
failure at the 2013 Columbus Re
gional courtesy of its seventh-place
team finish, Stanford washed away
any residual feelings on Saturday
with a sweet victory at the Eugene
Regional Championships.
Outgoing junior Patrick
Rodgers made it a sweep of the
medalist honors for the Card, win
ning the event by six strokes and
crushing the field in the process.
The soon-to-be professional golfer
now has 11 individual wins in his il
lustrious collegiate career, tying the
program record held by Tiger

Woods. He has but one chance left to
break the tie at the NCAA
Championships. The story truly
does appear to be writing itself; des
tiny is afoot.
"Happy to advance today, great
to win our fourth tournament in a
row on a very difficult and demand
ing golf course in Eugene Country
Club," said Stanford head coach
Conrad Ray. "Neat to see Patrick
Rodgers pick up his 11th win and tie
Tiger's school record. He really had
full command of his game and creat
ed a lot of separation by hitting his
ball in the fairway a lot and putting
well. So proud of him, and it would
be neat to see him maybe break the
record at NCAAs here next week."
As in their victory at the Pac-12
Championships in late April, the
Cardinal were in control from
Thursday's first gun until the last
scorecard was signed on Saturday
afternoon. Ray's quintet shot out of
the gate with a 4-under 276 team
score in Thursday's fourth round, a
solid performance which afforded
the Card a four-shot lead over Okla
homa and a 10-stroke advantage
over third place.

Unsurprisingly, the effort was
spearheaded by Rodgers, who
turned in a marvelous 4-under 66
scorecard, which included five
birdies over a seven-hole stretch
and put him atop the individual
leaderboard a position he would
never relinquish. Sophomore David
Boote was the only other Stanford
player under par in the opening 18,
carding a 1-under 69 thanks to four
birdies on his back nine. The Card
also counted freshman Viraat Bad
hwar's even-par 70 and senior
Cameron Wilson's 1-over 71.
Friday was much of the same for
the squad, which has not lost a tour
nament since its runner-up placing
at the Southern Highlands Colle
giate Masters in early March.
Though its 2-over 282 cumulative
score didn't match its Thursday
number, Stanford still expanded its
lead over the Sooners to nine shots.
Rodgers followed up his 66 with a
four-birdie, one-bogey 3-under 67.

last NCAA event got into the red
