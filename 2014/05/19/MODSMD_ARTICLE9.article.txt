# ENERGY IN EUGENE

### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
As the saying goes, what a differ
ence a year can make.
For the Stanford men's golf
team, the difference between the
2013 Columbus Regional and the
2014 Eugene Regional is the chasm
separating satisfaction and disap
pointment, victory and defeat and
most importantly moving on
and going home. This time, the Car
dinal are on the right side of the di
vide.
After tasting the bitterness of
failure at the 2013 Columbus Re
gional courtesy of its seventh-place
team finish, Stanford washed away
any residual feelings on Saturday
with a sweet victory at the Eugene
Regional Championships.
Outgoing junior Patrick
Rodgers made it a sweep of the
medalist honors for the Card, win
ning the event by six strokes and
crushing the field in the process.
The soon-to-be professional golfer
now has 11 individual wins in his il
lustrious collegiate career, tying the
program record held by Tiger

Woods. He has but one chance left to
break the tie at the NCAA
Championships. The story truly
does appear to be writing itself; des
tiny is afoot.
"Happy to advance today, great
to win our fourth tournament in a
row on a very difficult and demand
ing golf course in Eugene Country
Club," said Stanford head coach
Conrad Ray. "Neat to see Patrick
Rodgers pick up his 11th win and tie
Tiger's school record. He really had
full command of his game and creat
ed a lot of separation by hitting his
ball in the fairway a lot and putting
well. So proud of him, and it would
be neat to see him maybe break the
record at NCAAs here next week."
As in their victory at the Pac-12
Championships in late April, the
Cardinal were in control from
Thursday's first gun until the last
scorecard was signed on Saturday
afternoon. Ray's quintet shot out of
the gate with a 4-under 276 team
score in Thursday's fourth round, a
solid performance which afforded
the Card a four-shot lead over Okla
homa and a 10-stroke advantage
over third place.

Unsurprisingly, the effort was
spearheaded by Rodgers, who
turned in a marvelous 4-under 66
scorecard, which included five
birdies over a seven-hole stretch
and put him atop the individual
leaderboard a position he would
never relinquish. Sophomore David
Boote was the only other Stanford
player under par in the opening 18,
carding a 1-under 69 thanks to four
birdies on his back nine. The Card
also counted freshman Viraat Bad
hwar's even-par 70 and senior
Cameron Wilson's 1-over 71.
Friday was much of the same for
the squad, which has not lost a tour
nament since its runner-up placing
at the Southern Highlands Colle
giate Masters in early March.
Though its 2-over 282 cumulative
score didn't match its Thursday
number, Stanford still expanded its
lead over the Sooners to nine shots.
Rodgers followed up his 66 with a
four-birdie, one-bogey 3-under 67.

last NCAA event got into the red

Freshman Viraat Badhwar (above) was the only Cardinal golfer other than Patrick Rodgers and Cameron
Wilson to place in the top 20 in the regional, tying for 14th. Rodgers won the title and Wilson was T-sth.
