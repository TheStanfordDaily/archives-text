Take four musicians, sixty-eight string quartets, and the
genius of Franz Josef Haydn: stir vigorously and applaud
wildly. San Francisco Chamber Orchestra All-Stars Robin
Sharp, Antoine van Dongen, Ben Simon, and Hannah
Addario-Berry are the Haydn Project, launched in September
2013 to boldly go where few quartets have gone before.
Join us for a journey of exploration into the mostly brilliant,
always inventive, enormously engaging string quartets of
"Papa" Haydn.

Chamber Orchestras is a violist and music educator. He

orchestras around the world, and was a member of the
