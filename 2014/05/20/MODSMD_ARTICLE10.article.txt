## Looking forward to 2016: Combating the knowledge gap 
### Aimee Trujillo 
The "second term curse" is no
secret. For almost every pres
ident who has served two
terms, their presidential approval
rating has dropped in the second
term. President Obama has not
been insulated from this particular
trend and is now faced with current
ly declining levels of support from
the U.S. public.
Many people claim that Obama's
ratings spell trouble for the Democ
rats in both the 2014 midterm elec
tions and the 2016 presidential elec
tion. Historical studies indicate that
every 5 percent increase in a presi
dent's net approval rating increases
his party's candidate's margin by 1
percent in the following presidential
election, with the trend also holding
in the opposite direction.
Considering that fact, it's true
that what is happening now in the
government will undoubtedly shape
public approval of the two parties.
However, the 2016 election is not
riding on something as simple as the
general approval rating of the pres
ident. What matters most is the mis
information that forms this public
opinion.
One setback that Obama has
faced in his second term is the roll
out of the Affordable Care Act,
more commonly dubbed Oba
macare. The law itself passed, ful
filling Obama's promise of sweeping
healthcare reform to get all Ameri

cans healthcare coverage. However,
according to the latest Kaiser
Health Tracking Poll, 48 percent of
people still have a negative view of
the reform. The chaotic technologi
cal launch of HealthCare.gov in Oc
tober 2013 has left people associat
ing dysfunctional technology with
the quality of the whole law.
Because of this, 57 percent of
people still believe the administra
tion fell short of its enrollment goal,
despite the fact that healthcare plan
enrollment under the ACA has far
surpassed the administration's pro
jection of 7 million additions. Com
batting this entrenched lack of un
derstanding will be crucial for the
Democratic candidate in 2016 to
gain more support from moderates
and independents.

How can Democrats eliminate
this knowledge gap? Advertisement
is an important tool that can be used
for shaping public opinion. While it
is difficult to pin down the exact ef
fect that advertising has on election


outcomes, Ken Goldstein,
professor of political science
at the University of Wiscon
sin-Madison, explains that
"advertising very, very much
matters at the margin," espe
cially as Election Day ap
proaches. The swing votes at
the margin are what could
make or break the next presi
dential election.
That is why the Demo
cratic Party faces a huge chal
lenge dealing with the Koch
brothers as the 2016 election
approaches. The Koch broth

ers have spent tens of millions
of the $4l billion attributed to
their name to push forward
their libertarian views in poli
tics. They are notorious for
their anonymous political giv
ing a method that circum
vents standing campaign fi
nance laws by funding
"groups that are not required
to disclose donors groups
that work to determine the
outcome of federal, state and
even municipal elections."
This money is spent on op
position campaigns directly
against Obama administra
tion policies. It is funding ad
vertising by groups touting
the need for drastically lower
personal and corporate taxes,
minimal social services for the

needy and much less over
sight of industry especially
environmental regulation.
The challenge to the Demo
cratic Party in the ad wars
does not come from the fact of
opposition, but rather from
the amount of money being
spent. The founder of the
Center for Public Integrity, a
nonpartisan watchdog group,
is concerned about the "pat
tern of law-breaking, political
manipulation and obfusca
tion" that is on a "whole dif
ferent level" than anyone else.
The Kochs "are the Standard
Oil of our times," he said.
The Democrats must be
prepared to face and combat
the obscene amounts of
money pouring into opposi

tion advertising in the 2016
election. Money is not the
only thing that matters in
elections, but it makes a cru
cial difference. It tilts the bal
ance of what ideological mes
sages the public will see and
exacerbates income inequali
ty, increasing the potential for
vote buying through political
donations. While the Demo
cratic Party may not have the
means to match the money
being spent on the opposition
campaigns, they must be able
to spend enough to combat
growing misconceptions in
order to make 2016 a success
ful year for their candidates.
