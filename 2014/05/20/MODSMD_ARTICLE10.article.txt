## Looking forward to 2016: Combating the knowledge gap 
### Aimee Trujillo 
The "second term curse" is no
secret. For almost every pres
ident who has served two
terms, their presidential approval
rating has dropped in the second
term. President Obama has not
been insulated from this particular
trend and is now faced with current
ly declining levels of support from
the U.S. public.
Many people claim that Obama's
ratings spell trouble for the Democ
rats in both the 2014 midterm elec
tions and the 2016 presidential elec
tion. Historical studies indicate that
every 5 percent increase in a presi
dent's net approval rating increases
his party's candidate's margin by 1
percent in the following presidential
election, with the trend also holding
in the opposite direction.
Considering that fact, it's true
that what is happening now in the
government will undoubtedly shape
public approval of the two parties.
However, the 2016 election is not
riding on something as simple as the
general approval rating of the pres
ident. What matters most is the mis
information that forms this public
opinion.
One setback that Obama has
faced in his second term is the roll
out of the Affordable Care Act,
more commonly dubbed Oba
macare. The law itself passed, ful
filling Obama's promise of sweeping
healthcare reform to get all Ameri

cans healthcare coverage. However,
according to the latest Kaiser
Health Tracking Poll, 48 percent of
people still have a negative view of
the reform. The chaotic technologi
cal launch of HealthCare.gov in Oc
tober 2013 has left people associat
ing dysfunctional technology with
the quality of the whole law.
Because of this, 57 percent of
people still believe the administra
tion fell short of its enrollment goal,
despite the fact that healthcare plan
enrollment under the ACA has far
surpassed the administration's pro
jection of 7 million additions. Com
batting this entrenched lack of un
derstanding will be crucial for the
Democratic candidate in 2016 to
gain more support from moderates
and independents.
