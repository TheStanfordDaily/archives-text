## GOP 2016: blue state, blue state 
### Anthony Ghosn 
The prospects for a Republican
White House in 2016 are slim,
to say the least. The GOP
would have to overcome numerous
and complex challenges in order to
win the necessary 270 Electoral
College votes come Election Day.
Not only do the Republicans face
problems organizing their own
party and popular base, but they
are also competing against the
ultra-organized Democratic Party,
which already has very promising
prospects for 2016.
The main challenge that the Re
publicans will face in 2016 is a demo
graphic one. Ethnically white indi
viduals constitute 89 percent of the
party base, which does not bode well
for the future. During the last Re
publican presidential win, in 2004,

white Americans constituted ap
proximately 67 percent of the popu
lation. By 2020 that number will be
closer to 60 percent. This is especial
ly concerning to Republican hope
fuls because in the 2012 elections,
Republicans only captured 20 per
cent of non-white voters. If the Re
publicans are unable to shift their
message to capture the hopes of
non-white Americans, they are at
risk of being in serious trouble in the
coming presidential election.
The demographic reality is exac
erbated by the way that the Elec
toral College works in this nation.
Nearly all states apportion all of
then- Electoral College votes to the
majority winner of the state elec
tion, as opposed to giving them out
representatively. As a consequence,

even a below average Democratic
candidate could start out with ap
proximately 246 electoral votes.
This was reflected by the fact that
Obama only won 51 percent of the
popular vote in 2012 but trounced
Romney with an Electoral College
lead of 332 votes to Romney's 206.
Republican National Committee
Chairman Reince Priebus has sup
ported state legislatures' initiatives
to vote for changes to the system
that would favor Republican candi
dates. However, opponents have
characterized such measures as
being blatant examples of election
rigging. I'm not convinced that any
bold changes in the fabric of our
electoral process will bear any fruit
by 2016. In fact, I'm sure that
this electoral disadvantage
will persist.

It would be one thing if
there was a united and adap
tive Republican Party that
could face these hurdles to
gether. However, the GOP
has proved itself to be lethar
gic and out of touch. Democ
rats have successfully brand
ed conservative candidates as
being special interest repre
sentatives with antiquated
social policies. Consider the
fact that during the 2012 elec
tion, Republican pundits all
believed that Romney was
going to win. The key conser

vative polling group, Ras
mussen, was consistently in
correct in predicting the elec
toral outcome of the primar
ies and the general election.
Moreover, the sophisticated
and data-driven campaign
strategies of the Democratic
Party have yet to penetrate
the Republican organization.
To make matters worse,
the key moderate prospect
for the Republican seat,
Chris Christie, has been rela
tively marginalized as a po
tential candidate because of a
series of scandals in his home
state of New Jersey leaving
mostly radical party mem
bers as alternatives. Ted
Cruz and Rick Perry are all
considered hard-lined con
servatives that can fire up
the shrinking base, but other
than that they have little
global appeal. Jeb Bush is not

guaranteed to run. Rand
Paul seems to be building a
more nationally appealing
image, but the idea that
Americans will elect a self
avowed libertarian over a
moderate Democrat is a pipe
dream.
It may be far in the future
but barring any extreme dis
aster in the Democratic Party
that would makes its general
election candidate unpalat
able to the American people, I
give the 2016 race to the De
mocrats by a large electoral
college majority. America's
leading conservative party is
just not sufficiently adaptive
or nimble enough to navigate
the enormous challenges it
faces in competing for the
White House.

that would favor Republican candi
dates. However, opponents have
characterized such measures as
being blatant examples of election
rigging. I'm not convinced that any
bold changes in the fabric of our
electoral process will bear any fruit
by 2016. In fact, I'm sure that
this electoral disadvantage
will persist.

It would be one thing if
there was a united and adap
tive Republican Party that
could face these hurdles to
gether. However, the GOP
has proved itself to be lethar
gic and out of touch. Democ
rats have successfully brand
ed conservative candidates as
being special interest repre
sentatives with antiquated
social policies. Consider the
fact that during the 2012 elec
tion, Republican pundits all
believed that Romney was
going to win. The key conser

vative polling group, Ras
mussen, was consistently in
correct in predicting the elec
toral outcome of the primar
ies and the general election.
Moreover, the sophisticated
and data-driven campaign
strategies of the Democratic
Party have yet to penetrate
the Republican organization.
To make matters worse,
the key moderate prospect
for the Republican seat,
Chris Christie, has been rela
tively marginalized as a po
tential candidate because of a
series of scandals in his home
state of New Jersey leaving
mostly radical party mem
bers as alternatives. Ted
Cruz and Rick Perry are all
considered hard-lined con
servatives that can fire up
the shrinking base, but other
than that they have little
global appeal. Jeb Bush is not

guaranteed to run. Rand
Paul seems to be building a
more nationally appealing
image, but the idea that
Americans will elect a self
avowed libertarian over a
moderate Democrat is a pipe
dream.
It may be far in the future
but barring any extreme dis
aster in the Democratic Party
that would makes its general
election candidate unpalat
able to the American people, I
give the 2016 race to the De
mocrats by a large electoral
college majority. America's
leading conservative party is
just not sufficiently adaptive
or nimble enough to navigate
the enormous challenges it
faces in competing for the
White House.
