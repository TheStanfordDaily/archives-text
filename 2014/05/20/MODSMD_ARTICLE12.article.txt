## GOP 2016: blue state, blue state 
### Anthony Ghosn 
The prospects for a Republican
White House in 2016 are slim,
to say the least. The GOP
would have to overcome numerous
and complex challenges in order to
win the necessary 270 Electoral
College votes come Election Day.
Not only do the Republicans face
problems organizing their own
party and popular base, but they
are also competing against the
ultra-organized Democratic Party,
which already has very promising
prospects for 2016.
The main challenge that the Re
publicans will face in 2016 is a demo
graphic one. Ethnically white indi
viduals constitute 89 percent of the
party base, which does not bode well
for the future. During the last Re
publican presidential win, in 2004,

white Americans constituted ap
proximately 67 percent of the popu
lation. By 2020 that number will be
closer to 60 percent. This is especial
ly concerning to Republican hope
fuls because in the 2012 elections,
Republicans only captured 20 per
cent of non-white voters. If the Re
publicans are unable to shift their
message to capture the hopes of
non-white Americans, they are at
risk of being in serious trouble in the
coming presidential election.
The demographic reality is exac
erbated by the way that the Elec
toral College works in this nation.
Nearly all states apportion all of
then- Electoral College votes to the
majority winner of the state elec
tion, as opposed to giving them out
representatively. As a consequence,

even a below average Democratic
candidate could start out with ap
proximately 246 electoral votes.
This was reflected by the fact that
Obama only won 51 percent of the
popular vote in 2012 but trounced
Romney with an Electoral College
lead of 332 votes to Romney's 206.
Republican National Committee
Chairman Reince Priebus has sup
ported state legislatures' initiatives
to vote for changes to the system
that would favor Republican candi
dates. However, opponents have
characterized such measures as
being blatant examples of election
rigging. I'm not convinced that any
bold changes in the fabric of our
electoral process will bear any fruit
