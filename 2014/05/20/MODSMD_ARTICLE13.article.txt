## The 						human cost of militarism 
### Tim Borgerson 
Militarism, as listed in the dic
tionary, is (1) the tendency to
hold military efficiency as
the supreme ideal of the state, and
(2) the use of military power to
achieve non-military goals. Most of
us, however, don't think in dictionary
definitions. Stark and imposing, 'mil
itarism' conjures images of machine
guns and mushroom clouds, Desert
Storm and stormtroopers, goosestep
marches and dynamic dictators.
My cultural understanding of

militarism was shaped by many of
the great films that depict it films
by Kubrick and Coppola where it
dons the mask of a brutal and capri
cious drill sergeant, and spawns hor
rifying solitude and vicious mad
ness. Militarism is, to me, most rec
ognizable in that twentieth century
regalia though sometimes I find
it evokes a queasy nostalgia for the
'simpler times' of George W Bush's
first term, when the battle lines
seemed to be drawn more clearly
and drones and the NSA had not
made their way into the national
consciousness.
For many, however, 'militarism' is
another scrap of esoterica churned
out by political scientists and
philosophers in the 'ivory tower'
next door. It is difficult to develop a
personal connection to an issue that
spans oceans. To us, the conse
quences of militarism are not tangi
ble. Louis C.K. sums it up: "In
America, we have the luxury of
telling our kids what war is." Those
living in Syria or Afghanistan don't.
And it is precisely on this "us-them"
dichotomy that militarism thrives.
Addressing the systemic prob
lem of militarism requires a multi
pronged approach. Students for Al
ternatives to Militarism (formerly
Stanford Says No to War) is hosting
an event this Wednesday at 6 p,m. at
the Women's Community Center ti
tled "The Human Cost of Mili
tarism" where we will explore the di
verse and systemic oppression that
militarism perpetuates. Likewise,
we hope to instill a consciousness of
militarism within other vital fights

for social justice; the military-indus
trial complex, hawkish politicians
and their broad base of trigger
happy constituents are an enemy too
powerful for any single protest or di
rect action to thwart.
Militarism is a problem so in
tractable it can only be unraveled.
As militaristic practices become
more insidious abroad clandes
tine drone warfare and "enhanced
interrogation techniques" —they
become normalized and reproduced
at home. The drone technology used
to kill thousands of individuals
abroad is being replicated for sur
veillance of US citizens; the tech
nique of collecting "metadata"
used by the NSA to catch and kill
"enemy combatants" —has been
levied on the American public as
well; sexual assault in the military is
pervasive and institutionally mis
handled; and at the U.S.-Mexico
border, immigrants are treated as
foreign invaders. In 2012 alone,
Americans opened fire on 22 individ
uals armed with... rocks.
Over the past decade, militaris
tic machinations have become more
artfully deceptive, demanding dy
namic and multi-nodal forms of re
sistance. It's relatively easy to build
coalitions to protest an expensive
and unjust war with large numbers
of American casualties; it is much
more difficult to build resistance
when drone deaths are displayed
next to sports scores on the scroll
ing cable news marquee. By nor
malizing things like civilian drone
casualties and domestic sur
veillance, the military-indus
trial complex erodes the
leverage of concerned ac
tivists. Leverage that felt
tangible and real when Stan
ford students burned their
draft notices in 1965, or when
Cindy Sheehan camped out
side Bush's ranch in 2005, has
since dissipated.
With our event, "The

Human Cost of Militarism,"
SAM intends to begin conver
sations with other social jus
tice-minded students and
carve out space where mere
lament can turn into con
crete action. Unlike the U.S.
military, we know our efforts
are most effective when we
act multilaterally. We under
stand that genuine alterna
tives to militarism will only
be realized by maintaining
solidarity with fellow stu
dents and activists fighting
for queer, economic, racial
and environmental justice.
The contemporary ef

fects of militarism may ap
pear less cataclysmic and
less spectacular than the
popular images of war that
dwell in our collective imagi
nation. This suggests, how
ever, that the evils of mili
tarism are becoming in
creasingly banal. We may
not have draft notices to
burn, but refusing to "smile
for the camera" is one good
place to start.

Militarism, as listed in the dic
tionary, is (1) the tendency to
hold military efficiency as
the supreme ideal of the state, and
(2) the use of military power to
achieve non-military goals. Most of
us, however, don't think in dictionary
definitions. Stark and imposing, 'mil
itarism' conjures images of machine
guns and mushroom clouds, Desert
Storm and stormtroopers, goosestep
marches and dynamic dictators.
My cultural understanding of

militarism was shaped by many of
the great films that depict it films
by Kubrick and Coppola where it
dons the mask of a brutal and capri
cious drill sergeant, and spawns hor
rifying solitude and vicious mad
ness. Militarism is, to me, most rec
ognizable in that twentieth century
regalia though sometimes I find
it evokes a queasy nostalgia for the
'simpler times' of George W Bush's
first term, when the battle lines
seemed to be drawn more clearly
and drones and the NSA had not
made their way into the national
consciousness.
For many, however, 'militarism' is
another scrap of esoterica churned
out by political scientists and
philosophers in the 'ivory tower'
next door. It is difficult to develop a
personal connection to an issue that
spans oceans. To us, the conse
quences of militarism are not tangi
ble. Louis C.K. sums it up: "In
America, we have the luxury of
telling our kids what war is." Those
living in Syria or Afghanistan don't.
And it is precisely on this "us-them"
dichotomy that militarism thrives.
Addressing the systemic prob
lem of militarism requires a multi
pronged approach. Students for Al
ternatives to Militarism (formerly
Stanford Says No to War) is hosting
an event this Wednesday at 6 p,m. at
the Women's Community Center ti
tled "The Human Cost of Mili
tarism" where we will explore the di
verse and systemic oppression that
militarism perpetuates. Likewise,
we hope to instill a consciousness of
militarism within other vital fights

for social justice; the military-indus
trial complex, hawkish politicians
and their broad base of trigger
happy constituents are an enemy too
powerful for any single protest or di
rect action to thwart.
Militarism is a problem so in
tractable it can only be unraveled.
As militaristic practices become
more insidious abroad clandes
tine drone warfare and "enhanced
interrogation techniques" —they
become normalized and reproduced
at home. The drone technology used
to kill thousands of individuals
abroad is being replicated for sur
veillance of US citizens; the tech
nique of collecting "metadata"
used by the NSA to catch and kill
"enemy combatants" —has been
levied on the American public as
well; sexual assault in the military is
pervasive and institutionally mis
handled; and at the U.S.-Mexico
border, immigrants are treated as
foreign invaders. In 2012 alone,
