## A
						week in Mexico unlike any other 
### Ashley Westhem 
It's not NASCAR and it's not
monster trucks. It's off-road
racing, but try as I might, I
could not really describe to
my friends what my sister
and I were doing last week for seven
days in Mexico.
My dad, Dave Westhem, was a
professional off-road racer, and now
takes part in the sport recreationally.
I had the life-changing opportunity to
finally go with him and Westhem Rac
ing across the border to watch them
race in the Mexican 1000.
It's a 475-mile race down the Baja
peninsula put on by the National Off-
Road Racing Association (NORRA).
Everything from unlimited, souped
up vintage Ford pickup trucks, Bron
cos, buggies, VWs or, in our case, a
1967 Chevy K-1500 could be seen run
ning the race. The racecourse stalled
in Ensenada and ended in San Jose
Del Cabo, following the open beaches,
rough dirt back roads, mountain
paths and even a highway.
Westhem Racing ended up win
ning its vintage class by several hours
and placed ninth overall. In four years
of competing in the race, we (I consid
er myself a part of the team now) have
now had two wins, one blown crank
and one blown motor so basically
it's all or nothing.
I've always had a pretty good idea
of what my dad did, since there have
been various trucks and parts in our
garage over the years, and I've seen
him load up our lifted Excursion
(complete with cattle guard and extra
shocks) for multiple week-long racing
trips to Mexico before, but to be able
to go through the race as part of the
crew gave me an entirely new per
spective on the sport.
Just as I've taken a liking to row
ing because it combines the physicali
ty of sport with the psychological
component of the mind (and my
grandfather rowed for USC), I have a
new respect for off-road racing for the
amount of thought, mental prepara
tion and calculation that go into each
day of racing.
The first day of racing began at 6
a.m., but we were 88th off the line (re
member we ended up finishing ninth)
so the entirety of the day was fixed on
calculating how much time it would
take to overcome each slower car in
front of us (there were a lot because
we got gipped in our starting position)
and how much time would have to be
made up in certain spots.
My job on each of the next three
days was keeping track of the times of
each truck that came into the pits be
fore ours did in order to gauge our
progress and predict where we would
stand at the end of each day. I was a
part of the pit crew so as the race
truckwent through each stop, our Ex
cursion and two other gnarly, dually
pickups would quickly service the
race truck and then move on to the
next stop once it left (there was a lot of
waiting around, sandwich making and
handing out stickers and decals to the
local kids).
And then there's the j ob of co-driv
ing and navigating. While my dad
drove, his co-driver would trace their
progress on the GPS and call out di
rections and warnings from an elabo
rate course map given out each day.
Not only do the driver and co-driver
have to think about where the next silt
bed or the next hairpin turn is, they
also have to think about radioing to
the crew before each pit stop to in
form us how much fuel, coolant or
brake fluid is needed. And then you
have the added stress of any technical
difficulties that could go wrong a
busted motor and crank ended the
race early for the team twice previ
ously. This year, the blown-out rear
brakes and haywire GPS were luckily
easy fixes.
The danger of off-road racing
should not be underestimated,
though. It's definitely not an amateur
sport and the top finishers are always
experienced drivers. The guys who go
out to have fun and play around make
their way to the finish line slowly. Oth
erwise, they end up rolling a vintage
buggy worth a fortune on the beach or
limp across the finish line with a bro
ken A-arm (both of which happened).
All serious drivers wear full-faced
helmets, fire-retardant race suits,
neck braces and restraining harness
es. And it's dangerous for the specta
tors, too, who stand on the side of the
course as an insanely heavy and high
horsepower racing machine comes
barreling towards them at top speed
through the desert. I definitely have a
renewed sense of respect for the sport
now.
That's why I was never allowed to
