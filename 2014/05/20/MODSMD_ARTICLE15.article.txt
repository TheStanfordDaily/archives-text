# HEARTBREAK IN ATHENS

### FIONA NOONAN STAFF WRITER 
After yet another nail-biter of a
match, the No. 11 Stanford
women's tennis team's (20-3, 8-2
Pac-12) championship hopes ended
after the Card fell 4-3 to No. 7
North Carolina (29-5,12-2 ACC) in
the NCAA Final Four on Monday.
The Cardinal came in riding the
momentum of huge wins against
No. 6 California and No. 3 Virginia,
but they could not hold off the Tar
Heels behind huge performances
by No. 5 Hayley Carter and the
country's No. 1 player, Jamie Loeb.

5/19, Athens, Georgia
The match in Athens, Georgia
started inauspiciously for Stanford
at doubles for the second time in
three matches. Despite a win by
freshman Caroline Doyle and soph
omore Krista Hardebeck who
reentered the doubles rotation for
the first time all tournament on
court three, the Card did not cap
ture the doubles point. After fresh
man Taylor Davidson and junior
Ellen Tsay fell on court two, it came
down to the powerhouse duo of
freshman Carol Zhao and senior
Kristie Ahn. The pair jumped out to
a 5-2 lead, but a six-game torrent by
UNC's Carter and Loeb gave the
Tar Heels the point.
The match was by no means
over, though. If prior performance
is any indication, the Cardinal are
rarely fazed by early setbacks, and
rank disparities have had little ef
fect on the outcomes of past match
es. Before Monday, Stanford was
undefeated in its last nine NCAA
tournament matches when ranked
lower than its opponent. Unfortu
nately, that streak came crashing to
an end with Monday's loss.
As singles began, the Tar Heels

extended their lead to 2-0 as No. 51
Hardebeck fell to No. 5 Carter on
the second court. It marked the end
of a somewhat disappointing tour
nament for Hardebeck, who pro
vided the clincher in last year's
NCAA semifinal match. The sopho
more finished this year's tourna
ment having lost each of her last
three matches in straight sets.
This year's squad never settled,
though, and the 2-0 deficit was
quickly eliminated as No. 50 David
son blew past unranked Whitney
Kay on court four. Davidson has
been unstoppable since overcoming
leg cramps to tie up the match

against Cal in the round of 16.
At 2-1, No. 21 Zhao broke form
in a rare loss to No. 59 Caroline
Price on court three. Zhao lost her
first set for only the sixth time this
season, and after 4-4 ties in both
sets, Price pulled through to win in
two.
Down 3-1, the match came down
to the lower half of the court, where
No. 54 Tsay and No. 57 Doyle rep
resented the Cardinal on courts
five and six, respectively. Doyle in
creased her impressive win count to
33 on Monday with a 6-2, 6-3 win.
The freshman from San Francisco
has been a rock throughout the

tournament and did her part once
more to bring the score to 3-2. Tsay
had lost two in a row coming into
the match, but hit her stride with a
6-2,7-6 (4) victory over UNC's Kate
Vialle to tie up the match, and the
Cardinal found themselves back
where they were against Cal, with
the tournament on the line at 3-3.
Then it was all up to the nation's
third-ranked Kristie Ahn, the sen
ior and unequivocal leader of the
team. In the marquee match of the
day, she faced the top-ranked Loeb
on court one to play for the Cardi-

nal's life in the tournament.
Ahn began the match
with a hard-fought 7-6 (4) vic
tory in the first set, which
was Loeb's first set loss since
March, and her only setback
of the tournament. After
that, though, the freshman
from North Carolina steam
rolled the usually steadfast
Ahn to take the next two sets
6-0,6-0.
"By the end [Loeb] was
just pretty unconscious,"
said Stanford head coach
Lele Forood. "Kristie was
heroic in her first set, and
that was a good start, but
Jamie just started to just
kick it up a bit."
It was a disappointing
end to what otherwise been
an almost perfect season for
the Cardinal. After losing for
mer NCAA singles champion

Nicole Gibbs, it looked as
though Stanford might have
had a bit of a rebuilding year
after last year's national title.
But with the entrance of
freshmen Zhao, Doyle and
Davidson, the Cardinal's out
look is now brighter than ever.
The very young team has
much to look forward to in
the coming years, and in the
more immediate future, the
outlook for the NCAA sin
gles tournament looks fan
tastic. All six members of
Stanford's main lineup re
ceived spots in the tourna
ment, which will begin on
May 21.
"They were very tough,"
Forood said. "We had some
chances. We couldn't capital
ize on some things... As it
goes, we found three and we
couldn't find the fourth."

quickly eliminated as No. 50 David
son blew past unranked Whitney
Kay on court four. Davidson has
been unstoppable since overcoming
leg cramps to tie up the match

against Cal in the round of 16.
At 2-1, No. 21 Zhao broke form
in a rare loss to No. 59 Caroline
Price on court three. Zhao lost her
first set for only the sixth time this
season, and after 4-4 ties in both
sets, Price pulled through to win in
two.
Down 3-1, the match came down
to the lower half of the court, where
No. 54 Tsay and No. 57 Doyle rep
resented the Cardinal on courts
five and six, respectively. Doyle in
creased her impressive win count to
33 on Monday with a 6-2, 6-3 win.
The freshman from San Francisco
has been a rock throughout the

tournament and did her part once
more to bring the score to 3-2. Tsay
had lost two in a row coming into
the match, but hit her stride with a
6-2,7-6 (4) victory over UNC's Kate
Vialle to tie up the match, and the
Cardinal found themselves back
where they were against Cal, with
the tournament on the line at 3-3.
Then it was all up to the nation's
third-ranked Kristie Ahn, the sen
ior and unequivocal leader of the
team. In the marquee match of the
day, she faced the top-ranked Loeb
on court one to play for the Cardi-

nal's life in the tournament.
Ahn began the match
with a hard-fought 7-6 (4) vic
tory in the first set, which
was Loeb's first set loss since
March, and her only setback
of the tournament. After
that, though, the freshman
from North Carolina steam
rolled the usually steadfast
Ahn to take the next two sets
6-0,6-0.
"By the end [Loeb] was
just pretty unconscious,"
said Stanford head coach
Lele Forood. "Kristie was
heroic in her first set, and
that was a good start, but
Jamie just started to just
kick it up a bit."
It was a disappointing
end to what otherwise been
an almost perfect season for
the Cardinal. After losing for
mer NCAA singles champion

Nicole Gibbs, it looked as
though Stanford might have
had a bit of a rebuilding year
after last year's national title.
But with the entrance of
freshmen Zhao, Doyle and
Davidson, the Cardinal's out
look is now brighter than ever.
The very young team has
much to look forward to in
the coming years, and in the
more immediate future, the
outlook for the NCAA sin
gles tournament looks fan
tastic. All six members of
Stanford's main lineup re
ceived spots in the tourna
ment, which will begin on
May 21.
"They were very tough,"
Forood said. "We had some
chances. We couldn't capital
ize on some things... As it
goes, we found three and we
couldn't find the fourth."

After yet another nail-biter of a
match, the No. 11 Stanford
women's tennis team's (20-3, 8-2
Pac-12) championship hopes ended
after the Card fell 4-3 to No. 7
North Carolina (29-5,12-2 ACC) in
the NCAA Final Four on Monday.
The Cardinal came in riding the
momentum of huge wins against
No. 6 California and No. 3 Virginia,

5/19, Athens, Georgia
The match in Athens, Georgia
started inauspiciously for Stanford
at doubles for the second time in
three matches. Despite a win by
freshman Caroline Doyle and soph
omore Krista Hardebeck who
reentered the doubles rotation for
the first time all tournament on
court three, the Card did not cap
ture the doubles point. After fresh
man Taylor Davidson and junior
Ellen Tsay fell on court two, it came
down to the powerhouse duo of
freshman Carol Zhao and senior
Kristie Ahn. The pair jumped out to
a 5-2 lead, but a six-game torrent by
UNC's Carter and Loeb gave the
Tar Heels the point.
The match was by no means
over, though. If prior performance
is any indication, the Cardinal are
rarely fazed by early setbacks, and
rank disparities have had little ef
fect on the outcomes of past match
es. Before Monday, Stanford was
undefeated in its last nine NCAA
tournament matches when ranked
lower than its opponent. Unfortu
nately, that streak came crashing to
an end with Monday's loss.
As singles began, the Tar Heels

extended their lead to 2-0 as No. 51
Hardebeck fell to No. 5 Carter on
the second court. It marked the end
of a somewhat disappointing tour
nament for Hardebeck, who pro
vided the clincher in last year's
NCAA semifinal match. The sopho
more finished this year's tourna
ment having lost each of her last
three matches in straight sets.
This year's squad never settled,
though, and the 2-0 deficit was
quickly eliminated as No. 50 David

been unstoppable since overcoming
leg cramps to tie up the match

against Cal in the round of 16.
