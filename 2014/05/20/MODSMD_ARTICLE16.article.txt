# TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS
## PCRC title for lightweight rowing 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
No. 2 Stanford lightweight row
ing took care of business at the Pa
cific Coast Rowing (PCRC) Cham
pionships on Saturday one more
step towards its ultimate goal of re
peating its title at the Intercolle
giate Rowing Association National
Championships.
The Cardinal competed with two
boats in the Open 8 + race and ended
up taking first and second in the
event. The Stanford A boat finished
an astonishing 50.3 seconds ahead of
the B boat, which beat third-place
Colorado by 25.6 seconds. For the
varsity eight, it was its eighth win of
the spring season and fifth consecu
tive victory.
"There was a little bit of wind so
there is always a concern that we
might not get our catches in clean,"
said junior Mackenzie Crist. "But we
did a good job of executing our race."

Despite not racing a single four
event the entire spring, the Card put
together three boats to race in the
two heats of the Women's Collegiate
4 + in order to prepare for IRAs.

"This was our first race as a four
and was really a dress rehearsal for

IRAs in two weeks," said junior
coxswain Allison Nguyen. "It is a lit
tle different because there are less
people in the boat so the intensity
isn't as much. It is up to you to carry
out the race plan. We were down off
the start but our race plan is to keep

our heads in the boat. At the 250
[mark] we started walking on Sacra
mento State... I was really happy
with our result and am proud of
everybody in the boat. We have a

great point to work off of the
next two weeks."
The A boat finished five
seconds behind USC to take
second place in the first heat.
Stanford's B and C boats fin
ished second and fourth, re
spectively, in the second heat.

"Our mindset for this race
was to focus internally on our

boat and see what we could
do," Crist said. "We wanted to
have a race that we would feel
confident in heading in to
IRAs. We did a good job of
having a steady race to ac
complish that goal."
The lightweights will now
prepare for the real test of
their season in West Windsor,
New Jersey at the IRA Na
tional Championships, which
start May 28.
