# First ever Pac-12 title for women
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
The No. 3 Stanford women's
rowing team brought home the pro
gram's first ever Pac-12 Rowing
Championship title this past week

end by winning gold in three of four
races at Lake Natoma. Stanford
beat out possibly one of the toughest
Pac-12 fields in championship histo
ry, overtaking six other ranked
schools, including three other top-10
teams.
"We went in knowing it would be
a tough [lVB] race and we kept it to
gether," said senior Ali Fauci. "We
powered through it at the end and I
am just so proud of our team. From

top to bottom we really relied on
each other and it was an awesome
turnout for everyone."
By winning the 1V8,2V8 and IV4
events and earning the bronze in the
novice eight, the Cardinal managed
to beat No. 7 Washington by nine
points to claim the title, while No. 4
California, a favorite from the start
of the preseason, finished in third.
The third-place finish by the
novice eight was enough to defini

tively put the Cardinal ahead of the
Pac at the end of the day. It was the
first time that Stanford had man
aged to field a novice boat, which had
been a sore spot for the team in pre
vious years causing them to miss out
on crucial extra points. In 2010, the
Cardinal came close to beating Cal
for the title, but was a half point
short a difference that could have
been made up for with a finish by a
novice boat.
This year, the women's open
weight team brought up four rowers
from the lightweight varsity eight to
compose the novice boat. The eight
rowers had only rowed together for
a short piece on Saturday before
being sent out on the water to com
pete in the Pac-12 Championships
the next day. Due to Stanford's ad
missions standards and lack of walk
ons, it is typically very difficult for
women's rovring to field enough
women for a novice eight boat. The
mix of open weights and light
weights, however, rose to the occa
sion and managed a third-place fin
ish.
The IV4 captured its fifth con
secutive victory after jumping out to
an early lead with the fastest split
time in the opening 500 meters. The
Cardinal 2VB earned its third gold
medal in the past five years in a close
race with UCLA, Stanford held a
narrow but strong 0.33-second lead
in the first part of the race before it

No. 3 Stanford women's rowing (above) accomplished something last weekend that had never been done
before in program history by winning its first ever Pac-12 Championship. The historic feat was achieved
against arguably one of the most difficult fields ever, as the Cardinal beat six other ranked schools to win.
began to walk through and
beat the Bruins by 2.9 sec
onds.
"Stalling with the novice
eight, they only rowed togeth
er for one practice. That was
unreal watching them while
we were starting our warm
up," said senior Kristy
Wentzel. "Then watching the
four crush it and the 2VB blast
off the start. There is nothing
like watching your team
mates crush it to give you con
fidence that you are going to
have a fantastic day."
With the two gold medals
already secured, the IVB just
needed to finish in third in
order to secure the champi

onship. That race proved to
be the most competitive of the
day as the top four finishers
were only separated by 4.1
seconds. However, none of the
opponents' moves were good
enough to overtake the Cardi
nal, which led from the start.
It was the first time that the
IVB had won gold since 2009.
"From the beginning of
the season, this team had
their eye on the prize," said
head coach Yasmin Farooq.
"This conference champi
onship serves as a confidence
booster for how hard they can
fight in a race. I am proud of
them for that."
The team now has a two
week break from competition
to prepare for NCAAs in Indi
anapolis starting May 30.
