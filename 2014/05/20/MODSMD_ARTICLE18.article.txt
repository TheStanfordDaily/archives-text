### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
The city of Tulsa, Oklahoma isn't
exactly what one would call a "hop
ping destination." Sure, there are a
couple of universities, a still-boom
ing oil industry and an NBA Devel
opment League squad, but beyond
that, Tulsa is just another over
looked and unknown dot on the
American prairie sprawl. That will
all change this week, as the colle
giate golf world turns its gaze to
northwestern Oklahoma, watching
and waiting for the Tulsa Country
Club to crown a champion. This is
the 2014 NCAA Women's Golf
Championships, and Tulsa will have
its fifteen minutes give or take a
couple days of fame.
The Stanford women's golf team
certainly hopes its time in the spot
light will be longer than that. A win
would be historic for the Cardinal,
which will compete for the pro
gram's first national title against a
field that may be the tournament's
most competitive ever.
"We are thrilled to be in the fi
nals," remarked head coach Anne
Walker. "Now that we are here, we
would love to walk away with a top
-10 [finish] but we are not focused on
that. Our focus is solely on the
process and we will see where that
puts us on Friday afternoon."
However, if the Card's quintet is
to accomplish its ultimate goal in
Tulsa, it must first reach back into
the memory banks and recall the
lessons from its season-opening
event: the Dale McNamara Fall
Preview.
Held at the Tulsa Country Club
it was called a "preview" for a
reason the September tourna
ment was one of Stanford's poorest
performances in a season that has
otherwise been nothing short of in
credible. The team, composed of the
same five players that will take the
course today, limped to a ninth
place finish at the 15-sehool event,
19 strokes back from defending na
tional champions USC. In perspec
tive, ninth might not have been all
that bad for the Cardinal; all eight
squads in front of them are current
ly ranked in Golfstat's top 11. There
is certainly no shame in losing to
good teams, but if Walker's group

wants to significantly improve on its
T-13th position at last year's NCAA
Championships, it will have to find a
way to navigate the loaded field.
In order to be more successful
this time around, Stanford must im
prove its scoring average on the
course's 12 par-4 holes. Sophomore
Mariah Stackhouse was the Card's
only golfer to shoot below par on the
36 par-4s she faced over the 54-hole
tournament; her teammates aver
aged more than a quarter-stroke
above par on their par-4s. On the
season, sophomore Lauren Kim,
freshman Casey Danielson and jun
ior Mariko Tumangan are all aver
aging over-par scores on par-4s a
trend that will have to be reversed if
the Card will hope for a high finish.
Because Tulsa Country Club has
a medium length at 6194 yards,
Stanford will have to be on top its in
termediate and short game. How
well the Cardinal can execute their
shots from 100 yards and closer will
have a major impact on their scor
ing, as will their non-sand up-and
down completion percentage. Kim
and Stackhouse are among the best
collegiate golfers in that category,
converting non-sand up-and-downs
at rates of 73.2 and 69.6 percent, re
spectively.
"We are not going to change our
strategy tee to green very much
[from the Fall Preview]," said Walk
er of her team's on-course approach.
"There are a couple of holes playing
longer, so those will require differ
ent approach. But otherwise, same
mentality but more [success] on the
up-and-downs. In the fall, we were
30 percent on up-and-downs, and we
know that we have be around 60 per
cent to compete."
To compete, the Card will need
strong participation from the entire
lineup, one through five. At this
point in the season, both frontrun
ners and depth are needed to sup
port championship aspirations;
Stanford has shown it has both, but
the two aspects often haven't coin
cided. Nonetheless, Walker isn't so
much concerned with her lineup's
consistency as she is with putting to
gether and sticking to a winning
game plan.
"Golf is very much a day-to-day,

save pars. She has converted 69.6 percent of her non-sand up-and-downs, among the best in the nation.
week-to-week game," she
said. "There are so many ele
ments involved that consis
tency alone is difficult to
achieve. So, I don't have any
expectations for my players,
but we just put together the
best strategy we can and go
from there."
Whether that means a na
tional championship or not is

still unknown, but after Stan
ford's heroics at the Pac-12
Championships, do not put
anything past this team. If all
five golfers play up to their
averages this season, the
Card will have an excellent
chance of improving on its T
-13th finish from last year's
championships. Anything
more will require the squad
to go above and beyond, but
that's something they've al
ready proven is possible.

The city of Tulsa, Oklahoma isn't
exactly what one would call a "hop
ping destination." Sure, there are a
couple of universities, a still-boom
ing oil industry and an NBA Devel
opment League squad, but beyond
that, Tulsa is just another over
looked and unknown dot on the
American prairie sprawl. That will
all change this week, as the colle
giate golf world turns its gaze to
northwestern Oklahoma, watching
and waiting for the Tulsa Country
Club to crown a champion. This is
the 2014 NCAA Women's Golf
Championships, and Tulsa will have
its fifteen minutes give or take a
couple days of fame.
The Stanford women's golf team
certainly hopes its time in the spot
light will be longer than that. A win
would be historic for the Cardinal,
which will compete for the pro
gram's first national title against a
field that may be the tournament's
most competitive ever.
"We are thrilled to be in the fi
nals," remarked head coach Anne
Walker. "Now that we are here, we
would love to walk away with a top
-10 [finish] but we are not focused on
that. Our focus is solely on the
process and we will see where that
puts us on Friday afternoon."
However, if the Card's quintet is
to accomplish its ultimate goal in
Tulsa, it must first reach back into
the memory banks and recall the
lessons from its season-opening
event: the Dale McNamara Fall
Preview.
Held at the Tulsa Country Club
it was called a "preview" for a
reason the September tourna
ment was one of Stanford's poorest
performances in a season that has
otherwise been nothing short of in
credible. The team, composed of the
same five players that will take the
course today, limped to a ninth
place finish at the 15-sehool event,
19 strokes back from defending na
tional champions USC. In perspec
tive, ninth might not have been all
that bad for the Cardinal; all eight
squads in front of them are current
ly ranked in Golfstat's top 11. There
is certainly no shame in losing to
good teams, but if Walker's group

wants to significantly improve on its
T-13th position at last year's NCAA
Championships, it will have to find a
way to navigate the loaded field.
In order to be more successful
this time around, Stanford must im
prove its scoring average on the
course's 12 par-4 holes. Sophomore
Mariah Stackhouse was the Card's
only golfer to shoot below par on the
36 par-4s she faced over the 54-hole
tournament; her teammates aver
aged more than a quarter-stroke
above par on their par-4s. On the
season, sophomore Lauren Kim,
freshman Casey Danielson and jun
ior Mariko Tumangan are all aver
aging over-par scores on par-4s a
trend that will have to be reversed if
the Card will hope for a high finish.
Because Tulsa Country Club has
a medium length at 6194 yards,
Stanford will have to be on top its in
termediate and short game. How
well the Cardinal can execute their
shots from 100 yards and closer will
have a major impact on their scor
ing, as will their non-sand up-and
down completion percentage. Kim
and Stackhouse are among the best
collegiate golfers in that category,
converting non-sand up-and-downs
at rates of 73.2 and 69.6 percent, re
spectively.
