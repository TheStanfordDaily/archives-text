# Sunken Diamond sendoff
## Seniors win final game at home 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Stanford baseball's seniors said
goodbye to Sunken Diamond on a
high note, as Stanford (27-23,13-14
Pac-12) took care of business on
Monday night, securing a 5-2 victo
ry over the visiting Pacific Tigers
(26-27, 15-12 WCC). In its final
home game of the season, Stanford
was victorious in a must-win game
for its postseason push.
Seniors Danny Diekroeger,
Brett Michael Doran, Sam
Lindquist, Brant Whiting and A. J.
Yanegas and fifth-year senior Sahil
Bloom appeared for their final
game in the confines of Sunken Di
amond. This senior class exits with
two Super Regional appearances in
2011 and 2012 and still a fighting
chance at another. As redshirt jun
iors, both Lindquist and Whiting
are eligible to return for one more
year if they choose to do so.
"Just trying to enjoy it, and just
have a good time with my team
mates and take in the whole experi
ence," said Diekroeger of his last
game at Sunken Diamond. "It's too
bad, a lot of good memories here."
"It was weird being out there
knowing it would be my last time
out there," Doran added. "It felt a
lot better to get a win, but it was
definitely a little emotional know
ing that it was my last time playing
here."
Freshman Brett Hanewich ex
celled in his final start of the regu
lar season, throwing his first career
complete game. Although he did
allow 13 hits, he showed great poise
and maturity throughout the game
and surrendered only two runs, is
sued one walk and stranded nine
runners on base.
"I felt back to where I was at the
beginning of the year where I was
throwing more strikes," Hanewich
said. "I kind of got away from that
towards the end of the year but it
was nice to get that back."
After Pacific scored its first run
of the game in the third inning to
take a 1-0 lead, Hanewich locked
down and got the next batter out to
leave two on base. Then again in the
sixth inning, with runners on the
corners, he struck out Pacific's J.J.
Wagner to end the inning. In the
eighth inning, Hanewich stifled yet

another rally attempt when, with
runners on first and second and one
out, he induced a groundout that
turned into a double play.
He saw through the complete
game in the ninth when, despite al
lowing another run, he retired Tay
lor Murphy to record Sunken Dia
mond's final out this season. Fit
tingly, it went to the hands of the
seniors, with Doran throwing to
Diekroeger for the last play of their
Sunken Diamond careers.
Although Pacific led 1-0, Stan
ford quickly responded with four
runs in the bottom of the third in
ning. An error by Pacific shortstop
Brett Sullivan allowed freshman
Jack Klein to reach first, and he
would advance to second on
Doran's 21st sacrifice bunt of the
year, a single-season Stanford
record.
After the second out was

recorded, Diekroeger singled and
junior Alex Blandino walked to
load the bases. Junior Austin Slater
then delivered the game-breaking
hit with a two-run single into right
field, extending his hitting streak
to 14 games in the process. An
error by Murphy in right field
moved Slater to second and
brought Blandino all the way home
from first to give Stanford the 3-1
lead. Sophomore Zach Hoffpauir
then doubled to stretch Stanford's
advantage to 4-1.
In the fourth inning,
Diekroeger singled to drive home
the fifth Cardinal run of the game.
His two hits helped contribute to
the four overall hits on the night by
the seniors out of seven overall,
with Doran and Whiting also pick
ing up a hit apiece.
"Just to see them and how
they've been going about them

selves and how they've been going
about the business, it kind of
changes my mentality about how I
want to go about my business, how
I want to be one of the leaders
maybe," said Hanewich of the sen
iors. "They go about doing what
they preach."
The home game might have also
been the final game at Sunken Dia
mond for several of the juniors who
could declare for the MLB Draft,
including Blandino and Slater, who
were both projected to go in the
first three rounds of the MLB
Draft by ESPN.
Stanford concludes its regular
season with a three-game series at
Utah this upcoming weekend. The
Cardinal likely need to win all three
games to enter the postseason, but
it is very difficult to project

team I really believe that.
We've had some struggles

Seniors Danny Diekroeger,
Brett Michael Doran, Sam

Yanegas and fifth-year senior Sahil

Stanford baseball's seniors said
goodbye to Sunken Diamond on a
high note, as Stanford (27-23,13-14
Pac-12) took care of business on
Monday night, securing a 5-2 victo
ry over the visiting Pacific Tigers
(26-27, 15-12 WCC). In its final
home game of the season, Stanford
was victorious in a must-win game
for its postseason push.
Seniors Danny Diekroeger,
Brett Michael Doran, Sam
Lindquist, Brant Whiting and A. J.
Yanegas and fifth-year senior Sahil
Bloom appeared for their final
game in the confines of Sunken Di
amond. This senior class exits with
two Super Regional appearances in
2011 and 2012 and still a fighting
chance at another. As redshirt jun
iors, both Lindquist and Whiting
are eligible to return for one more
year if they choose to do so.
"Just trying to enjoy it, and just
have a good time with my team
mates and take in the whole experi
ence," said Diekroeger of his last
game at Sunken Diamond. "It's too
bad, a lot of good memories here."
"It was weird being out there
knowing it would be my last time
out there," Doran added. "It felt a
lot better to get a win, but it was
definitely a little emotional know
ing that it was my last time playing
here."
Freshman Brett Hanewich ex
celled in his final start of the regu
lar season, throwing his first career
complete game. Although he did
allow 13 hits, he showed great poise
and maturity throughout the game
and surrendered only two runs, is
sued one walk and stranded nine
runners on base.
"I felt back to where I was at the
beginning of the year where I was
throwing more strikes," Hanewich
said. "I kind of got away from that
towards the end of the year but it
was nice to get that back."
After Pacific scored its first run
of the game in the third inning to
take a 1-0 lead, Hanewich locked
down and got the next batter out to
leave two on base. Then again in the
sixth inning, with runners on the
corners, he struck out Pacific's J.J.
Wagner to end the inning. In the
eighth inning, Hanewich stifled yet

another rally attempt when, with
runners on first and second and one
out, he induced a groundout that
turned into a double play.
He saw through the complete
game in the ninth when, despite al
lowing another run, he retired Tay
lor Murphy to record Sunken Dia
mond's final out this season. Fit
tingly, it went to the hands of the
seniors, with Doran throwing to
Diekroeger for the last play of their
Sunken Diamond careers.
Although Pacific led 1-0, Stan
ford quickly responded with four
runs in the bottom of the third in
ning. An error by Pacific shortstop
Brett Sullivan allowed freshman
Jack Klein to reach first, and he
would advance to second on
Doran's 21st sacrifice bunt of the
year, a single-season Stanford
record.
After the second out was

recorded, Diekroeger singled and
junior Alex Blandino walked to
load the bases. Junior Austin Slater
then delivered the game-breaking
hit with a two-run single into right
field, extending his hitting streak
to 14 games in the process. An
error by Murphy in right field
moved Slater to second and
brought Blandino all the way home
from first to give Stanford the 3-1
lead. Sophomore Zach Hoffpauir
then doubled to stretch Stanford's
advantage to 4-1.
In the fourth inning,
Diekroeger singled to drive home
the fifth Cardinal run of the game.
His two hits helped contribute to
the four overall hits on the night by
the seniors out of seven overall,
with Doran and Whiting also pick
ing up a hit apiece.
"Just to see them and how
they've been going about them

selves and how they've been going
about the business, it kind of
changes my mentality about how I
want to go about my business, how
I want to be one of the leaders
maybe," said Hanewich of the sen
iors. "They go about doing what
they preach."
The home game might have also
been the final game at Sunken Dia

were both projected to go in the
first three rounds of the MLB

Stanford baseball's seniors said
goodbye to Sunken Diamond on a
high note, as Stanford (27-23,13-14
Pac-12) took care of business on
Monday night, securing a 5-2 victo
ry over the visiting Pacific Tigers
(26-27, 15-12 WCC). In its final
home game of the season, Stanford
was victorious in a must-win game
for its postseason push.
Seniors Danny Diekroeger,
Brett Michael Doran, Sam
Lindquist, Brant Whiting and A. J.
Yanegas and fifth-year senior Sahil
Bloom appeared for their final
game in the confines of Sunken Di
amond. This senior class exits with
two Super Regional appearances in
2011 and 2012 and still a fighting
chance at another. As redshirt jun
iors, both Lindquist and Whiting
are eligible to return for one more
year if they choose to do so.
"Just trying to enjoy it, and just
have a good time with my team
mates and take in the whole experi
ence," said Diekroeger of his last
game at Sunken Diamond. "It's too
bad, a lot of good memories here."
"It was weird being out there
knowing it would be my last time
out there," Doran added. "It felt a
lot better to get a win, but it was
definitely a little emotional know
ing that it was my last time playing
here."
Freshman Brett Hanewich ex
celled in his final start of the regu
lar season, throwing his first career
complete game. Although he did
allow 13 hits, he showed great poise
and maturity throughout the game
and surrendered only two runs, is
sued one walk and stranded nine
runners on base.
"I felt back to where I was at the
beginning of the year where I was
throwing more strikes," Hanewich
said. "I kind of got away from that
towards the end of the year but it
was nice to get that back."
After Pacific scored its first run
of the game in the third inning to
take a 1-0 lead, Hanewich locked
down and got the next batter out to
leave two on base. Then again in the
sixth inning, with runners on the
corners, he struck out Pacific's J.J.
Wagner to end the inning. In the
eighth inning, Hanewich stifled yet

another rally attempt when, with
runners on first and second and one
out, he induced a groundout that
turned into a double play.
He saw through the complete
game in the ninth when, despite al
lowing another run, he retired Tay
lor Murphy to record Sunken Dia
mond's final out this season. Fit
tingly, it went to the hands of the
seniors, with Doran throwing to
Diekroeger for the last play of their
Sunken Diamond careers.
Although Pacific led 1-0, Stan
ford quickly responded with four
runs in the bottom of the third in
ning. An error by Pacific shortstop
Brett Sullivan allowed freshman
Jack Klein to reach first, and he
would advance to second on
Doran's 21st sacrifice bunt of the
year, a single-season Stanford
record.
After the second out was

recorded, Diekroeger singled and
junior Alex Blandino walked to
load the bases. Junior Austin Slater
then delivered the game-breaking
hit with a two-run single into right
field, extending his hitting streak
to 14 games in the process. An
error by Murphy in right field
moved Slater to second and
brought Blandino all the way home
from first to give Stanford the 3-1
lead. Sophomore Zach Hoffpauir
then doubled to stretch Stanford's
advantage to 4-1.
In the fourth inning,
Diekroeger singled to drive home
the fifth Cardinal run of the game.
His two hits helped contribute to
the four overall hits on the night by
the seniors out of seven overall,
with Doran and Whiting also pick
ing up a hit apiece.
"Just to see them and how
they've been going about them

selves and how they've been going
about the business, it kind of
changes my mentality about how I
want to go about my business, how
I want to be one of the leaders
maybe," said Hanewich of the sen
iors. "They go about doing what
they preach."
The home game might have also
been the final game at Sunken Dia
mond for several of the juniors who
could declare for the MLB Draft,
including Blandino and Slater, who
were both projected to go in the
first three rounds of the MLB
Draft by ESPN.
Stanford concludes its regular
season with a three-game series at
Utah this upcoming weekend. The
Cardinal likely need to win all three
games to enter the postseason, but
it is very difficult to project

GAME NOTES: Although it's tough to predict
the NCAA postseason baseball draw, it's
almost certain that in order for Stanford to
even stay in consideration for inclusion, it
must take care of business in Salt Lake City
and sweep the Utes, the worst team in the
conference. Utah has lost nine of its last
12 games and is riding a three-game los
ing streak in which it was it was outscored
30-10 by Arizona State. Stanford, mean
while, has won each of its last three week
end series.

Senior first baseman Danny Diekroeger (front) had two hits in his final game at Sunken Diamond, helping Stanford earn a much-needed victory in
its final push for the postseason. He and his brother Kenny have accounted for 206 straight games for Stanford in which a Diekroeger has started.

"This is a special group of
guys," Hanewich said. "Al
though our record may not
say that, we are a really good

team I really believe that.
We've had some struggles
pitching, we've had some
struggles at the plate, but it's

We're just trying to do every
