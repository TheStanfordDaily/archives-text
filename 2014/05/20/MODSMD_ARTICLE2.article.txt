# STUDENT LIFE
## Student-run photo contest expands scope Richard Sherman '10, Melanie Kannokada '06 to judge submissions 
### CHELSEY SVEINSSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With just one year of development under
its belt, the Stanford student-founded group
PCTRS (Photography Competing to Raise
Support) has reached new heights with its
second annual photo contest. To date,
PCTRS has received 53 submissions from
competitors and raised $1,650 for charities
that benefit women's health, with about two
weeks remaining in the contest.
The online competition encourages col
lege students to submit a photo and collect
donations for the image, with the top five
fundraisers earning spots as finalists.
Among the finalists, a winner will be chosen
by two guest celebrity judges Melanie
Kannokada 'O6 and Richard Sherman 'lO
and awarded two tickets to the Black Enter
tainment Television (BET) Awards in Los
Angeles. This year, the group's proceeds will
be donated to two local women's clinics:
Lyon-Martin Health Services and the Char
lotte Maxwell Complementary Clinic.
Inspiration and development
The idea for the fashion-inspired
fundraiser came to Anna Nit- Asare' 14 while
she was talking to her roommate Quadeera
Jackson 'l4 about helping out with a photo
shoot for a designer. Asare, a former partic
ipant in Stanford's Charity Fashion Show
which disbanded after 2011 was inspired
by the mission of the event but saw flaws in
its business model, believing that some as
pects of the show were inefficient for the
amount of effort needed to run a charity
drive.
"I wondered what would happen if you ...
took away the venue and flying in designers
and all that kind of stuff, and still focused on
the people who wanted to be models, design
ers, photographers," Nit-Asare said.
Nervous about the viability of her idea,
Nit-Asare first approached two close
friends who gave her the encouragement
and the confidence to pitch the idea to Jan
Barker-Alexander, director of the Black
Community Services Center (BCSC).
"I remember her saying this very clear
ly: This project has legs," Nit-Asare said.
Her confidence boosted, Nit-Asare
worked with both Barker-Alexander and
Diontrey Thompson, associate director of
the BCSC, to figure out the logistics of mak
ing the promising idea a reality. Nit-Asare
assembled a team of associate directors,
Robert Mata 'l4 and Farris Blount 111 'l4,
and the three have worked toward estab
lishing PCTRS since.
Expanding beyond Stanford
For Jackson, a runner-up in last year's
PCTRS competition and a competitor again
this year, the contest has developed
immensely.
"I think one of the biggest indica
tors of the growth of the competition
is the sheer number of competitors,"
Jackson said.
This year's efforts have been
successful compared to last year's
contest, which garnered 16 submis
sions and raised a grand total of
$1,850. The PCTRS team attrib
uted the improvement to the deci
sion to open the competition to col
leges across the nation as opposed
to keeping it within the Stanford
community.
"I think the biggest thing for this
year was that we decided to go na
tional instead of just staying with
California," Mata said. "So with
that, we branched out and asked
other black student unions and
other women's organizations at var
ious campuses that we've already
established connections with and
told them about this opportunity."
However, by opening the sub
mission pool, the PCTRS team
faced a daunting hurdle: marketing.
"The biggest thing with starting
something is making a name for
yourself and how you can legitimize
that," Nit-Asare said. She added
that Michael Pickrum '92 M.S. '94,
BET's executive vice-president,
furthered the contest's growth by
donating to the cause.
Although BET is not an official
sponsor, Nit-Asare hopes to one day
secure the entertainment network
as one in the future.
More than just the money
Each annual photo contest is
centered around a theme, and this
year's inspiration is Maya Angelou's
poem "Phenomenal Woman."
"All three of us wanted to focus on
women of color," Nit-Asare said. "It
became very apparent that was real
ly what we were very interested in,
in terms of showcasing women who

are not usually showcased in the
fashion industry, and in the way that
a picture can be so inclusive of some
body."
This theme is not only relevant to
the two women's clinics for which
PCTRS is fundraising, but also to
the contestants who expressed and
shared their personal connection to
the theme.
'"Phenomenal Woman' is some

thing that my mom read to me as a
child, and it really does resonate with
the type of person I would like to be
and that I am striving to be," said
Kaela Farrise 'l4, a contestant.
For D'Shai Hendricks 'l4, whose
picture features his mother, it was
his friendship with Nit-Asare and his
personal interpretation of theme
not the contest's prize that moti
vated him to enter the competition.

"Whether I win or not, my two
goals are accomplished: to raise the
money for Anna and for my mother
to know how much I love her," Hen
dricks said.
Given PCTRS's ambitious busi
ness goals, many have approached
Nit-Asare with questions about
what the future of the group looks
like, considering that the PCTRS
team consists entirely of graduating

seniors.
"The beauty of it is that we can do
this work wherever we are; we never
thought of it as a student organiza
tion," Nit-Asare said. "We don't plan
on giving it to anybody or passing it
on to a Stanford student after us, but
carrying it with us."
