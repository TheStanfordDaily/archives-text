# STUDENT LIFE

### CHELSEY SVEINSSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With just one year of development under
its belt, the Stanford student-founded group
PCTRS (Photography Competing to Raise
Support) has reached new heights with its
second annual photo contest. To date,
PCTRS has received 53 submissions from
competitors and raised $1,650 for charities
that benefit women's health, with about two
weeks remaining in the contest.
The online competition encourages col
lege students to submit a photo and collect
donations for the image, with the top five
fundraisers earning spots as finalists.
Among the finalists, a winner will be chosen
by two guest celebrity judges Melanie
Kannokada 'O6 and Richard Sherman 'lO
and awarded two tickets to the Black Enter
tainment Television (BET) Awards in Los
Angeles. This year, the group's proceeds will
be donated to two local women's clinics:
Lyon-Martin Health Services and the Char
lotte Maxwell Complementary Clinic.
Inspiration and development
The idea for the fashion-inspired
fundraiser came to Anna Nit- Asare' 14 while
she was talking to her roommate Quadeera
Jackson 'l4 about helping out with a photo
shoot for a designer. Asare, a former partic
ipant in Stanford's Charity Fashion Show
which disbanded after 2011 was inspired
by the mission of the event but saw flaws in
its business model, believing that some as
pects of the show were inefficient for the
amount of effort needed to run a charity
drive.
"I wondered what would happen if you ...
took away the venue and flying in designers
and all that kind of stuff, and still focused on
the people who wanted to be models, design
ers, photographers," Nit-Asare said.
Nervous about the viability of her idea,
Nit-Asare first approached two close
friends who gave her the encouragement
and the confidence to pitch the idea to Jan
Barker-Alexander, director of the Black
Community Services Center (BCSC).
"I remember her saying this very clear
ly: This project has legs," Nit-Asare said.
Her confidence boosted, Nit-Asare
worked with both Barker-Alexander and
Diontrey Thompson, associate director of
the BCSC, to figure out the logistics of mak
ing the promising idea a reality. Nit-Asare
assembled a team of associate directors,
Robert Mata 'l4 and Farris Blount 111 'l4,
and the three have worked toward estab
lishing PCTRS since.
