## Three Stanford graduates recognized as national finalists 
### DOMINICA WAMBOLD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last Friday, the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences announced the
winners of the 41st Student Academy
Awards. Among the 15 winners were two
recent Stanford M.F.A. graduates who
have continued the Stanford film pro
gram's tradition of excellence in this presti
gious competition after a two-year lull.
J. Christian Jensen 'l3 and Helen Hood
Scheer 'l3 claimed two of the three top
spots in the documentary category, while
Leslie Tai 'l3 was one of eight finalists in
the alternative category. All three were
honored to be national finalists.
"It was an exciting moment, and it was
made even greater when I saw listed with
me these really close friends of mine,"
Jensen said. "To see my friends also being
recognized for amazing and entirely differ
ent works from my own was the cherry on
top."
The competition
Held by the same Academy that runs
the Oscars, the Student Academy Awards
is a national student film competition that
presents gold, silver and bronze awards to
the top submissions in four categories: al
ternative, documentary, narrative and ani
mation. The winners are selected from the
nominations of over 500 college and univer
sity film students across the United States.
Among the past Student Academy
Award winners are prominent figures like
Spike Lee and John Lasseter. Award-win
ning films are included in festival showings
and benefit from increased prominence
critical publicity in the challenging world of
filmmaking.
Jensen's film, "White Earth" and
Scheer's, "The Apothecary," will both be
screened at the awards ceremony on June
7 in Hollywood's Directors Guild of Ameri
ca Theater, along with the third winning
documentary, produced by Zijan Mu of
New York University. The final medal
placements for each category will be an
nounced at the ceremony.
Their films
Jensen's "White Earth" tells the story
of the North Dakota oil boom through the
eyes of three children and their immigrant
mother. His film's story was one of many
that gained his attention as he began his
work towards his M.F.A., but when he trav
eled to North Dakota, he knew he had
found the quality of visual material he
wanted.
"Once it gets dark, you see these flames
coming out of the ground and these bright
towers in the distance shining into the sky,"
Jensen explained. "I was just really struck
by the visual other-worldliness of that area.

I knew that visually there was enough to
keep me interested, and I was confident
that I'd find the story to back that up."
In "The Apothecary," Scheer creates an
intimate portrait of the sole pharmacist in a
4,000-square-mile region in the American
Southwest. Scheer traveled to the town of
Nucla, Colorado, expecting to cover the
story of the pharmacy's closure, but when
the proprietor made a last-minute decision
to keep the community landmark open,
Scheer used her extensive preparation to
pivot her focus.
"I think that the work I did developing
the concept and the underlying themes
that I wanted to focus on ... and the rapport
I had built with the character permitted me
to adapt when I needed to," Scheer said.
Tai's experimental documentary in the
alternative category, "The Private Life of
Fenfen," features a young Chinese migrant
worker whose tragic love story is broadcast
to other migrant workers in China.
According to Tai, Stanford's program
helped her to confront the negotiation of
"the fine line between fiction and documen
tary" and provided the space to discuss the
tensions faced by modern documentary
filmmakers.
"I am completely [uninterested] in the
fagade that documentary is 100 percent
real; I see that much of the work that is
coming out these days is blurring the lines
into a documentary-fiction hybrid," Tai
said. "I think directly addressing the sub
jectivity and perception of reality as being
just that is the most appropriate way to
deal with documentary."
A history of achievement at Stanford
For decades, the Student Academy
Awards have recognized exceptional work
carried out by Stanford students. Stanford
students have taken home more Oscars
than their closest academic competitors
(the University of California, Berkeley and
Columbia University) combined over the
last 14 years.
Jensen explained that the University's
M.F.A. program was one of the first to focus
exclusively on documentary films.
"Stanford has a really long track record
of excellence," Jensen said. "Over time, it
has developed a reputation, and it has be
come a place where really serious docu
mentary film makers flock to, so that cer
tainly helps with the quality of work that
comes out of the program."
Stanford's program is also unusual for
its two-year curriculum, in contrast to the
three- to five-year programs offered by
other renowned institutions. Jensen ex
plained that the shorter timespan also
helped him alleviate the cost of graduate
school.

"Two of the reasons why I am
such a champion of the program and
why it worked so well for me were:
first, that it's a two-year program,"
Jensen said. "Second, that it's highly
structured, which I think is impor
tant for me in that you enter the pro
gram having in mind a specific set of
films that you're going to be mak
ing."
Tai emphasized the value of the
Stanford M.F.A. program's affilia
tion with the broader University.
"Stanford is amazing because out
of all the film schools, it is the only
one that is attached to a world-class
university," she said. "I think there's
a lot in the curriculum that reflects
that."
The Student Academy Awards is
just one of many prestigious award
and festival processes in which Stan
ford has gained recognition over the
years. Over the past several months,
Tai, Jensen, Scheer and their peers
have seen their films played in inter
national festivals including France's
Festival International de Pro
grammes Audiovisuels, Toronto's
Hot Docs, the International Docu
mentary Film Festival Amsterdam
Paradocs and the Museum of Mod
ern Art's Documentary Fortnight.
Looking to the future
For Scheer, the award represent
ed a nationally respected accredita
tion that would help her to achieve
her future goals in filmmaking and
academia. She had her eye on the
award prior to coming to Stanford
and was thrilled that her M.F.A.
work has brought her the recogni
tion.
"Several years ago I was talking
with a professor at a university in
southern California, and I told him
that my goal was to teach at his uni
versity or at another good school in
the area," Scheer said. "He turned
his nose up at me and said the only
way I could hope of getting a job at
his institution was if I won a Student

Academy Award or something like
it."
"Part of what I went to Stanford
for was to increase my ability to han
dle complex material as a non-fiction
storyteller," Scheer added. "I also
wanted to segue into teaching, and I
knew what this award meant."
All three finalists shared hopes to
teach film and work with the next
generation of documentary film
makers.
"I'm really interested in pushing
forward in exploring this authorial
voice that I think I found at Stan
ford," Jensen said. "I want to contin
ue to do independent work, and
eventually I would really like to
teach. I really enjoy mentoring and
working with other filmmakers who
are passionate about what they do."

— J. CHRISTIAN JENSEN'13
Last Friday, the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences announced the
winners of the 41st Student Academy
Awards. Among the 15 winners were two
recent Stanford M.F.A. graduates who
have continued the Stanford film pro
gram's tradition of excellence in this presti
gious competition after a two-year lull.
J. Christian Jensen 'l3 and Helen Hood
Scheer 'l3 claimed two of the three top
spots in the documentary category, while
Leslie Tai 'l3 was one of eight finalists in
the alternative category. All three were
honored to be national finalists.
"It was an exciting moment, and it was
made even greater when I saw listed with
me these really close friends of mine,"
Jensen said. "To see my friends also being
recognized for amazing and entirely differ
ent works from my own was the cherry on
top."
The competition
Held by the same Academy that runs
the Oscars, the Student Academy Awards
is a national student film competition that
presents gold, silver and bronze awards to
the top submissions in four categories: al
ternative, documentary, narrative and ani
mation. The winners are selected from the
nominations of over 500 college and univer
sity film students across the United States.
Among the past Student Academy
Award winners are prominent figures like
Spike Lee and John Lasseter. Award-win
ning films are included in festival showings
and benefit from increased prominence
critical publicity in the challenging world of
filmmaking.
Jensen's film, "White Earth" and
Scheer's, "The Apothecary," will both be
screened at the awards ceremony on June
7 in Hollywood's Directors Guild of Ameri
ca Theater, along with the third winning
documentary, produced by Zijan Mu of
New York University. The final medal
placements for each category will be an
nounced at the ceremony.
Their films
Jensen's "White Earth" tells the story
of the North Dakota oil boom through the
eyes of three children and their immigrant
mother. His film's story was one of many
that gained his attention as he began his
work towards his M.F.A., but when he trav
eled to North Dakota, he knew he had
found the quality of visual material he
wanted.
"Once it gets dark, you see these flames
coming out of the ground and these bright
towers in the distance shining into the sky,"
Jensen explained. "I was just really struck
by the visual other-worldliness of that area.

I knew that visually there was enough to
keep me interested, and I was confident
that I'd find the story to back that up."
In "The Apothecary," Scheer creates an
intimate portrait of the sole pharmacist in a
4,000-square-mile region in the American
Southwest. Scheer traveled to the town of
Nucla, Colorado, expecting to cover the
story of the pharmacy's closure, but when
the proprietor made a last-minute decision
to keep the community landmark open,
Scheer used her extensive preparation to
pivot her focus.
"I think that the work I did developing
the concept and the underlying themes
that I wanted to focus on ... and the rapport
I had built with the character permitted me
to adapt when I needed to," Scheer said.
Tai's experimental documentary in the
alternative category, "The Private Life of
Fenfen," features a young Chinese migrant
worker whose tragic love story is broadcast
to other migrant workers in China.
According to Tai, Stanford's program
helped her to confront the negotiation of
"the fine line between fiction and documen
tary" and provided the space to discuss the
tensions faced by modern documentary
filmmakers.
"I am completely [uninterested] in the
fagade that documentary is 100 percent
real; I see that much of the work that is
coming out these days is blurring the lines
into a documentary-fiction hybrid," Tai
said. "I think directly addressing the sub
jectivity and perception of reality as being
just that is the most appropriate way to
deal with documentary."
A history of achievement at Stanford
For decades, the Student Academy
Awards have recognized exceptional work
carried out by Stanford students. Stanford
students have taken home more Oscars
than their closest academic competitors
(the University of California, Berkeley and
Columbia University) combined over the
last 14 years.
Jensen explained that the University's
M.F.A. program was one of the first to focus
exclusively on documentary films.
"Stanford has a really long track record
of excellence," Jensen said. "Over time, it
has developed a reputation, and it has be
come a place where really serious docu
mentary film makers flock to, so that cer
tainly helps with the quality of work that
comes out of the program."
Stanford's program is also unusual for
its two-year curriculum, in contrast to the
three- to five-year programs offered by
other renowned institutions. Jensen ex
plained that the shorter timespan also
helped him alleviate the cost of graduate
school.

"Two of the reasons why I am
such a champion of the program and
why it worked so well for me were:
first, that it's a two-year program,"
Jensen said. "Second, that it's highly
structured, which I think is impor
tant for me in that you enter the pro
gram having in mind a specific set of
films that you're going to be mak
ing."
Tai emphasized the value of the
Stanford M.F.A. program's affilia
tion with the broader University.
"Stanford is amazing because out
of all the film schools, it is the only
one that is attached to a world-class
university," she said. "I think there's
a lot in the curriculum that reflects
that."
The Student Academy Awards is
just one of many prestigious award
and festival processes in which Stan
ford has gained recognition over the
years. Over the past several months,
Tai, Jensen, Scheer and their peers
have seen their films played in inter
national festivals including France's
Festival International de Pro

such a champion of the program and
why it worked so well for me were:
first, that it's a two-year program,"
Jensen said. "Second, that it's highly
structured, which I think is impor
tant for me in that you enter the pro
gram having in mind a specific set of
films that you're going to be mak
ing."
Tai emphasized the value of the
Stanford M.F.A. program's affilia
tion with the broader University.
"Stanford is amazing because out
of all the film schools, it is the only
one that is attached to a world-class
university," she said. "I think there's
a lot in the curriculum that reflects
that."
The Student Academy Awards is
just one of many prestigious award
and festival processes in which Stan
ford has gained recognition over the
years. Over the past several months,
Tai, Jensen, Scheer and their peers
have seen their films played in inter
national festivals including France's
Festival International de Pro
grammes Audiovisuels, Toronto's
Hot Docs, the International Docu
mentary Film Festival Amsterdam
Paradocs and the Museum of Mod
ern Art's Documentary Fortnight.
Looking to the future
For Scheer, the award represent
ed a nationally respected accredita
tion that would help her to achieve
her future goals in filmmaking and
academia. She had her eye on the
award prior to coming to Stanford
and was thrilled that her M.F.A.
work has brought her the recogni
tion.
"Several years ago I was talking
with a professor at a university in
southern California, and I told him
that my goal was to teach at his uni
versity or at another good school in
the area," Scheer said. "He turned
his nose up at me and said the only
way I could hope of getting a job at
his institution was if I won a Student

Academy Award or something like
it."
"Part of what I went to Stanford
for was to increase my ability to han
dle complex material as a non-fiction
storyteller," Scheer added. "I also
wanted to segue into teaching, and I
knew what this award meant."
All three finalists shared hopes to
teach film and work with the next
generation of documentary film
makers.
"I'm really interested in pushing
forward in exploring this authorial
voice that I think I found at Stan
ford," Jensen said. "I want to contin
ue to do independent work, and
eventually I would really like to
teach. I really enjoy mentoring and
working with other filmmakers who
are passionate about what they do."
