## Obama intends to nominate Stanford alumnus as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development 
### â€“ Lucy Svoboda 
San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro '96 has reportedly
been tapped by President Barack Obama as the next
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
Castro has led an active political career since leaving
Stanford. At 26, after graduating from Harvard Law
School, he became the youngest councilman ever elect
ed in San Antonio. Now, at age 39, the three-term offi
cer serves as the youngest mayor of a major American
city.
During his time in office, Castro has worked for the
expansion of pre-kindergarten education and the revi
talization of downtown San Antonio. He has also spoken
out in favor of same-sex marriage and affirmative ac
tion, crediting the latter as a factor that allowed him ad
mission to Stanford.
Castro's work in San Antonio has generally been
well received and he has even been rumored as a poten
tial vice presidential candidate in 2016.
If nominated, Castro will replace current HUD sec
retary Shaun Donovan, who is said to be heading to the
Office of Management and Budget.
Political Ticker reported, however, that a formal an-
nouncement may still be several
weeks away as the White House is
still in the process of vetting Castro.
In response to the speculations,
the White House said, "We have no
personnel announcements at this
time."
