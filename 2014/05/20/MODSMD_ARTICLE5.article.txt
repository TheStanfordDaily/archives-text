The Office of Undergraduate Admis
sion at Stanford reported on Monday that
78.9 percent of admitted students had ac
cepted their offer of admission to Stanford
to join the Class of 2018. This represents a
2.9 percent jump from the 76.7 percent
yield for the Class of 2017 and the highest
yield of enrolled students in Stanford's his
tory.
This means that roughly 1,690 students
have enrolled to join the Class of 2018 out of
the 2,138 students who were admitted.
These numbers are still preliminary,
and are subject to change until the final
class statistics are presented in September,
according to Colleen Lim M.A. 'BO, associ
ate director of undergraduate admission.
"Any way you look at it, the Class of 2018
is extraordinary," Lim said. "We anticipat-

Ed that our overall yield would in
crease due to Stanford's outstand
ing reputation and... the 8.5 per
cent increase in applications, but
we were very pleased with these
amazing results."
Lim noted that the incoming
class has a 50/50 split of male and
female matriculants and repre
sents students from all 50 U.S.
states and 57 other countries.
