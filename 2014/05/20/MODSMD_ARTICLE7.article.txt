### â€“ Lucy Svoboda 
On May 21, the Clayman Insti
tute for Gender Research at Stan
ford will launch the Center for the

Advancement of Women's Leader
ship. Shelley Correll, Director of
the Clayman Institute and Profes
sor of Sociology at Stanford, will
lead the center, which aims to pro
mote women's leadership in busi
ness, government and education.
The center will host an inaugural
event on Wednesday, where pan
elists will present research on a new
model for inclusion created by NYU
Professor Kenji Yoshino and
Christie Smith, national managing
principal at the Deloitte University
Leadership Center for Inclusion.
"We believe prosperity and inno
vation require the full participation
of both men and women," Correll
said in a press release. "Our initial
goal is to increase women's repre
sentation in top leadership positions
to at least 30 percent. Only when
women's voices are more fully in
cluded in the important decisions
facing our companies, our govern
ments and our universities will we

be able to bring new perspectives on
how to address the world's issues
and challenges."
In order to address the shortage
of women in leadership roles, the
center aims to address three target
areas: empowering women to suc
ceed, engaging men in conversa
tions about the gender gap and cre
ating effective organizations.
In addition, the center seeks to
partner with top companies and pol
icymakers to research how to devel
op more inclusive environments.
