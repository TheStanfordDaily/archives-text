# Invasive species of mosquitoes found in Santa Clara County
## 
### â€“ Kylie Jue 
On May 5, the Santa Clara Coun
ty Vector Control District began a
campaign to notify Palo Alto resi
dents of a species of small, invasive
mosquitoes that are new to the area.
According to the University's
biosafety manager, Ellyn Segal,
these Yellow Fever Mosquitoes
were eradicated from an area near
the San Francisco airport in 1979.
However, they were discovered in
Los Angeles in 2011 and first reap
peared in Northern California in
Fresno and San Mateo in 2013. In
August, they were found in a resi
dential area of Menlo Park, close to
the Palo Alto border.
Although being bitten by one of

the mosquitoes is not in itself dan
gerous, the species has the ability to
carry pathogens foreign to the area,
such as dengue, yellow fever and
chikungunya. Dengue in particular
can have severe effects for someone
who has been previously infected
with the virus.
Segal explained that residents
should take the same precautions
that they would against normal
mosquitoes, such as wearing long
sleeves and pants, using insect re
pellent and getting rid of standing
water. However, one distinctive
characteristic sets yellow fever
mosquitoes apart from other
species in the area.
"The difference between these
mosquitoes and California mosqui
tos is that they are active during the
day," Segal said.
At only a quarter of an inch in
size, the Yellow Fever Mosquito is
also distinguishable by the white
dots on its black body. Due to their
small size, members of the species
do not need much water to plant
their eggs a supply as small as
dew on a leaf would be sufficient.

Although the species has not yet
been detected in Palo Alto and all
cases of dengue in the area have af
fected overseas travelers, the dis
trict has placed traps along the bor
der to detect mosquito activity. The
district has also requested that any
sightings of the mosquitoes or day
time bites be reported to the county.
