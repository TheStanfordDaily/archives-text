## OP-ED R&DE everywhere 
### Emily Grubert 
Old grumpy grad students like
me enjoy returning to our for
mer haunts back in my un
dergrad days, I got to be grumpy
about the environment in these very
pages. While it's a pleasure to be
complaining in The Daily again, it
takes something special to rouse
grad students to take a public stand
on a campus issue. Today, I feel com
pelled to comment on the latest in
stance in a long history of things that
make it harder for me to nostalg 1
around campus. That is, the recent
announcement that yet another one
of the restaurants that provides
some dining diversity on campus
Ike's Place in the Huang Engineer
ing Center is being replaced by
R&DE.
Ike's is losing its contract after a
highly nontransparent process that
improperly claims deep student en
gagement. I, along with about 900
other people who frequent the Sci
ence and Engineering Quad, took a
survey last fall and then discovered
that a committee unanimously decid
ed that R&DE should get the Huang
contract. Unanimous results and
mysterious student representation
tend to get my attention.
More important, though, is the
nature of the survey used to declare
that R&DE better meets student de
sires than Ike's.
I'm doing a Ph.D. on how social
preferences can be used to make bet
ter policy decisions, so I struggle
with how to figure out what those so
cial preferences are every, damn,
day. I will probably spend a year de
signing a survey that I will subse
quently throw out because I didn't
ask the light questions in the light
way to actually answer the question I
am asking, and then I will spend an
other year getting it right.
So I know that, even if it was un
intentional, the survey we got about
food service in the Huang Engineer
ing Center was poorly designed to
answer the question of what food es

tablishment students want in
Huang. However, as I commented to
several peers at the time, it was very
well-designed to get rid of Ike's.
Here's how it worked. The pri
mary two questions on the R&DE
survey the ones Stanford is now
using most to justify the R&DE
takeover asked:
1) What do you think is a reasonable
and realistic price point for your
lunch food and drinks only, not in
cluding tax and optional gratuity?
2) What do you think is a reasonable
and realistic amount of time to wait,
starting with getting in line up until
your food is ready and 'in your hand'?
True, Ike's sandwiches tend to be
more expensive than others, and the
line is notoriously long (though there
are $5 options, portions are huge and
you can order ahead and stand in a
30-second line if you want). But the
survey didn't ask about mitigating
factors, and it didn't ask about oper
ating hours, what quality means,
whether diversity in food options is
valuable or a whole host of other rel
evant issues. The survey seemed
stacked against Ike's.
Interestingly, a student-initiated
runoff-style survey asking "which
vendor do you want to operate in
Huang Engineering Center next
year? R&DE or Ike's?" yielded an
overwhelming majority in favor of
Ike's more than 97 percent of
over 2,600 survey respondents. Al
though not perfect, this survey was
at least direct and clear as was the
student response.
But back to my Stanford nostal
gia, and to the bigger problem that I
see on campus. Whatever you think
about Ike's, you'd be hard-pressed to
say that it's just like everything else
on campus. In the four years be
tween when I graduated from Stan
ford and came back to do a Ph.D., the
diversity of dining options on campus
has plummeted. On my graduation
