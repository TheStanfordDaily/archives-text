An Introduction to the Mind-Body effects of
the Transcendental Meditatioiftechnique
with Pamela Peeke, M.D.
Wed. May 21 @ 7:3opm / Jordan Hall / Bid. 420 / Rm. 40
Pam Peeke MD, MPH, FACP
Dr. Peeke is a Pew Foundation Scholar in Nutrition and Metabolism, Assistant
Professor of Medicine at the University of Maryland, and a Fellow of the American
College of Physicians. Dr. Peeke holds dual masters degrees in public health
and policy from the University of California at Berkeley. After completing her
internal medicine residency at George Washington University, Dr. Peeke became
a senior research fellow in the NlH's National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development, and was the recipient of the National Science Research Award.
Her studies were integral to establishing the relationship between chronic, toxic
stress and excess fat deposition within the abdomen. As the first senior research
fellow in the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine, Dr. Peeke helped develop the
science review process for complementary medicine research protocols.
Using her New York Times bestselling book The Hunger Fix as a template, and
incorporating new food and addiction neuroscience as well as nutritional
epigenetics, Dr. Peeke is creating the first in-residence integrative lifestyle
program to address addictive eating behaviors. Integral to the program is the
practice of meditation in reversing addiction related impairment of both the
brain's reward center, and its "CEO", the prefrontal cortex.
Coming next week / May 28 / Hacking Consciousness / Jordan Hall I Bid. 420 / Rm. 40
Fred Travis. Ph.D., will speak on "We Create Our Reality: Brain Development, Neural
Plasticity, and Higher States of Consciousness." His presentation will include live brain
scans to show how meditation alters brain function. Don't miss this concluding seminar!
