## SEEIN GREEN The 						fear factor 
### Holly Moeller 
Last week, the climate-con
scious received new cause for
alarm. Two studies, published
separately but simultaneously by
independent groups of scientists,
reached the same frightening con
clusion: The West Antarctic ice
sheet is collapsing. And there's
nothing we can do about it.
Their separate lines of evidence
told the story of the southern conti
nent's response to global change
and its inevitable impacts on the
rest of the planet. Driven by cli
mate-intensified winds, warm ocean
water is seeping under the glaciers
that extend over the western por
tion of the continent, which is caus
ing the glaciers to melt and release
their stores of frozen water into the
ocean. The surplus of liquid con
tributes to global sea level rise,
causing scientists to estimate that,
as the ice sheet melts over the com
ing decades, global sea levels will
rise by at least 10 feet. (Note that
this doesn't mean that the ocean's
edge will come 10 feet inland, but
rather that the sea's surface will be
10 feet higher. Depending on the
slope of the coastline, that could cor
respond to hundreds of feet inland
and millions of dollars in sub
merged property.)
Though it will take centuries for
the ice sheet to fully melt, scientists
believe that this process, which is
now well under way, is inevitable.
Once the glaciers have retreated be
yond a certain point, they propagate
an instability that leads the whole
ice sheet to enter an irreversible de
cline. It's a depressing conclusion:
no matter what we do carbon
taxes, tree plantings, geoengineer
ing schemes the sea level is going
to keep rising. We're now playing a
game of coastline defense: How
many billions of dollars are we will
ing to invest to preserve our myriad
coastal cities? Our vacation views?
This is the point where most peo
ple put down the news story, take a
deep breath and wonder why they
even pay attention when the news
always makes them so depressed.
Climate change reporting seems
to be a particular offender. The
media is full of "scare stories": mes
sages that emphasize the over
whelming scale of climate change
impacts (widespread crop failures;
terrifying superstorms) and the
global magnitude of the problem it
self (the fact that we are so deeply
intertwined with our fossil fuel
economy; the need for seemingly
impossible global accords on green
house gas emissions).
No wonder many Americans
prefer to turn a blind eye to the
problem. We justify this naivety in
many ways: by citing climate
change denialists despite their lack
of scientific backing, by bemoaning
our individual lack of agency or by
shaking our fists helplessly at politi
cians' ineptitude.
Increasingly, climate scientists
and environmental advocates are
realizing that the problem in Amer

ica isn't a lack of information, but
rather an excess of it. Over
whelmed, we're burying our heads
in the sand.
But we shouldn't be. The time for
scare tactics is over, and the time for
solutions is now.
Yes, climate change is a notori
ously "wicked" problem: It's diffi
cult to disentangle responsibilities,
hard to clearly link cause and effect
and socially complex to develop so
lutions.
But it's also a slow-moving prob
lem with a multitude of solutions
that we can implement and in
deed are implementing today.
For example, the collapsing
Antarctic ice sheet cited in last
week's news will take generations to
fully melt. While we don't want to ig
nore the problem and leave our chil
dren to deal with the consequences,
we do have time to adapt. And hu
manity's ability to adapt is a hall
mark of our species. We have lots of
possibilities: We could reinforce our
positions with seawalls or make a
calculated retreat to higher ground,
for examples. These options may
not be ideal, but they do exist.
Meanwhile, we have the ability
to slow or reduce the impacts of cli
mate change by modulating the size
of our carbon footprint. Immediate
ly eliminating it altogether is a mon
umental and, frankly, impossible
task, but slowly shifting our en
ergy supply to renewable sources
solar, wind, hydroelectric â€”is
possible, and it's happening.
And for those like me frus
trated by our individual inadequacy,
I can offer only the following
thoughts. A small change is still a
change, and those around you may
observe and mimic it in the right di
rection as well. A drop in the bucket
is still a drop that wasn't there be
fore.

Cowering in fear is un-Ameri
can, unhealthy and unproductive.
It's time to change the climate nar
rative and start moving forward.
