# SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY
## Major, major 
### Vihan Lakshman 
It's that time of the year again.
The sun's out late into the
evenings, the temperature is an
almost-too-comfortable 70 degrees,
and the flowers and the existen
tial crises are in full bloom. It's
that time when the words "Follow
your passion" and "Do what you
love" get aggressively thrown
around. And the Axess of Evil sud
denly becomes relevant once more.
In short, it's major-declaration
season. A tradition as old as stress
itself. But are we really having the
right conversation this time of year?
What does it mean when people say,
"Find your passion?" If it, in fact,
does mean something tangible, is it
even good advice?
The "passion" question has al
ready been beaten to death and
then beaten to death again but I
hope to offer a slightly different per
spective other than the standard
"Yes" or "No" response. We often
tend to think of love and passion as
either a missing part of your soul
that you are predestined to discover
or a characteristic that needs long
term development.
What if it were neither of the
above? What if you had very little
control over what you fall in love
with, and perhaps more impor
tantly— that what you do love
doesn't even matter? Instead of
feeling compelled to question every
action as the "right decision," what
if we shifted our focus more to what
we could do with the choices we
make? Tough decisions would ab
solutely still exist; dissatisfaction

definitely wouldn't magically disap
pear. But there would be a funda
mental change that is lacking in the
traditional "find your passion" ap
proach: scrutinizing decisions
whether you made the "right"
choice would not be the default
approach.
This premise is shared, in large
part, by author Cal Newport, an as
sistant professor at Georgetown
University. Newport has published
many articles rebuking what he
calls the "Passion Hypothesis," the
belief that everyone has some latent
talent or deep love waiting to be dis
covered, and that failure in finding
that aforementioned ability would
doom you for eternity.
In one of his pieces, Newport
cites a talk by Mike Rowe, the host
of Discovery's Dirty Jobs, who
found that the road-kill collectors
and pig farmers he met on the show
were extremely satisfied with their
jobs. Why? As Newport puts it:
"Their contentment instead grew
over time as they got better at what
they did, and then leveraged this
skill to gain traits like competence,
autonomy and impact."
In other words, it's not so much
what you do as what you do with it.
Newport frequently cites studies

suggesting that job traits like inde
pendence and a sense of impact
matter far more than one's actual
work. As a result, perhaps it doesn't
matter exactly what we do or even if
we have a choice. The more relevant
question is how we can put in the
work to improve and ultimately
maintain a sense of satisfaction in a
major or in a career.

Of course, sometimes things just
do not work out and making a switch
is necessary. Many have argued,
however, that shifting gears should
not be the default response at the
first moment of dissatisfaction.

In a New York Times piece two
days ago, titled "A Life Beyond 'Do
What You Love,"' philosopher Gor
don Marino takes this idea a step
further and suggests that in some

instances, it can be noble to do
something you detest if it means
doing what's best for others.
I agree with Marino's assess
ment in the context of making the
most of limited options, but it
shouldn't, for example, dictate
choosing a potentially more lucra
tive major over a course of study
you find more interesting if you
have the option.

In fall quarter, I took a course ti
tled "Designing Your Stanford"
through the d.school. In the class,
we spent a good deal of time dis
cussing how to navigate the fire
hose of decisions at Stanford, in
cluding choosing a major. Although
we discussed design-thinking ideas
like prototyping to help make deci
sions, the class ultimately boiled

down to a discussion of how you
can't always control where you end
up, but you can work to engage and
try to make the most out of any situ
ation.
Perhaps "passion" doesn't lead
to happiness and satisfaction.
Maybe it's the other way around.
Maybe we really don't have a choice
in what we end up falling in love
with. Camus famously asserted that
Sisyphus, condemned to roll a boul
der up a mountain for eternity, must
be happy because he had meaning
and purpose in his life.
As I go through the process of
seriously thinking about what I
want to major in, I feel confused and
stressed at times, but it really


shouldn't have to be that way.
Your major or career for
that matter doesn't define
who you are. It's the other
way around. It's about what
you can do to contribute in a

particular way that really
counts. Hopefully, I can prac
tice what I preach, but that's
not the real question. What
really matters is what you do
with the choices you make,
and in a very real sense
that's far more empowering
than "finding your passion."

As I go through the process of
seriously thinking about what I
want to major in, I feel confused and
stressed at times, but it really


shouldn't have to be that way.
Your major or career for
that matter doesn't define
who you are. It's the other
way around. It's about what
you can do to contribute in a

particular way that really
counts. Hopefully, I can prac
tice what I preach, but that's
not the real question. What
really matters is what you do
with the choices you make,
and in a very real sense
that's far more empowering
than "finding your passion."

It's that time of the year again.
The sun's out late into the
evenings, the temperature is an
almost-too-comfortable 70 degrees,
and the flowers and the existen
tial crises are in full bloom. It's
that time when the words "Follow
your passion" and "Do what you
love" get aggressively thrown
around. And the Axess of Evil sud
denly becomes relevant once more.
In short, it's major-declaration
season. A tradition as old as stress
itself. But are we really having the
right conversation this time of year?
What does it mean when people say,
"Find your passion?" If it, in fact,
does mean something tangible, is it
even good advice?
The "passion" question has al
ready been beaten to death and
then beaten to death again but I
hope to offer a slightly different per
spective other than the standard
"Yes" or "No" response. We often
tend to think of love and passion as
either a missing part of your soul
that you are predestined to discover
or a characteristic that needs long
term development.
What if it were neither of the
above? What if you had very little
control over what you fall in love
with, and perhaps more impor
tantly— that what you do love
doesn't even matter? Instead of
feeling compelled to question every
action as the "right decision," what
if we shifted our focus more to what
we could do with the choices we
make? Tough decisions would ab
solutely still exist; dissatisfaction

definitely wouldn't magically disap
pear. But there would be a funda
mental change that is lacking in the
traditional "find your passion" ap
proach: scrutinizing decisions
whether you made the "right"
choice would not be the default
approach.
This premise is shared, in large
part, by author Cal Newport, an as
sistant professor at Georgetown
University. Newport has published
many articles rebuking what he
calls the "Passion Hypothesis," the
belief that everyone has some latent
talent or deep love waiting to be dis
covered, and that failure in finding
that aforementioned ability would
doom you for eternity.
In one of his pieces, Newport
cites a talk by Mike Rowe, the host
of Discovery's Dirty Jobs, who
found that the road-kill collectors
and pig farmers he met on the show
were extremely satisfied with their
jobs. Why? As Newport puts it:
"Their contentment instead grew
over time as they got better at what
they did, and then leveraged this
skill to gain traits like competence,
autonomy and impact."
In other words, it's not so much
what you do as what you do with it.
Newport frequently cites studies

suggesting that job traits like inde
pendence and a sense of impact
matter far more than one's actual
work. As a result, perhaps it doesn't
matter exactly what we do or even if
we have a choice. The more relevant
question is how we can put in the
work to improve and ultimately
maintain a sense of satisfaction in a
major or in a career.

Of course, sometimes things just
do not work out and making a switch
is necessary. Many have argued,
however, that shifting gears should
not be the default response at the
first moment of dissatisfaction.

In a New York Times piece two
days ago, titled "A Life Beyond 'Do
What You Love,"' philosopher Gor
don Marino takes this idea a step
further and suggests that in some

instances, it can be noble to do
something you detest if it means
doing what's best for others.
I agree with Marino's assess
ment in the context of making the
most of limited options, but it
shouldn't, for example, dictate
choosing a potentially more lucra
tive major over a course of study
you find more interesting if you
have the option.

In fall quarter, I took a course ti
tled "Designing Your Stanford"
through the d.school. In the class,
we spent a good deal of time dis
cussing how to navigate the fire
hose of decisions at Stanford, in
cluding choosing a major. Although
we discussed design-thinking ideas
like prototyping to help make deci
sions, the class ultimately boiled

down to a discussion of how you
can't always control where you end
up, but you can work to engage and
try to make the most out of any situ
ation.
Perhaps "passion" doesn't lead
to happiness and satisfaction.
Maybe it's the other way around.
Maybe we really don't have a choice
in what we end up falling in love
with. Camus famously asserted that
Sisyphus, condemned to roll a boul
der up a mountain for eternity, must
be happy because he had meaning
and purpose in his life.
