## Thinking about Memorial Day at Stanford

We have written editorials in
the past of the importance
of dissociating the service
member from the conflict. On no day
is this distinction more important
than on Memorial Day, when we
honor the fallen, rather than that for
which they fell.
Woodrow Wilson put it perfectly
when on Memorial Day in 1914 he
said: "I can never speak in praise of
war, ladies and gentlemen; you
would not desire me to do so. But
there is this peculiar distinction be
longing to the soldier, that he goes
into an enterprise out of which he
himself cannot get anything at all.
He is giving everything that he hath,
even his life, in order that others
may live, not in order that he himself

may obtain gain and prosperity."
Last year at Stanford's Memorial
Day Ceremony, Tobias Wolff, a noted
writer and Vietnam War veteran,
came to speak about the ways we re
member, talk about and write about
our wars and the unreliability of
memory itself. It was a profound lec
ture that resonated with the mostly
veteran audience. Last year's cere
mony ended with a recitation by a
student veteran of an excerpt from
Wolff's book, "In Pharaoh's Army":
"Instead of remembering Hugh
as I knew him, I too often think of
him in terms of what he never had a
chance to be. The things the rest of
us know, he will not know. He will not
know what it is to make a life with
someone else. To have a child slip in

beside him as he lies reading on a
Sunday morning. To work at, and
then look back on, a labor of years.
Watch the decline of his parents, and
attend their dissolution. Lose faith.
Pray anyway. Persist. We are made to
persist, to complete the whole tour.
That's how we find out who we are."

We would like to leave you with
an obvious but important and pow
erful point: Stanford's students, fac
ulty, staff, and affiliates have fought
and died in almost every major con
flict since the University's inception.
They had no illusions of greatness or
glory, instead simply answering the
call of a country in need. Now that
they are gone, it is incumbent upon
