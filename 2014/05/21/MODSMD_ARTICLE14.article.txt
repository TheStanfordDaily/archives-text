## NBA benefits from ridiculous Cavs "fortune" 
### Vignesh Venkataraman 
The Cleveland Cavaliers
won the NBA Draft Lot
tery for the third time in
four years on Tuesday
night. Conspiracy theo
rists, you may start your engines...
now.
The probability of the Cavaliers
winning the lottery this year was a
meager 1.7 percent. Last year, when
they surprisingly elected to take
UNLV's Anthony Bennett with the
first pick, their probability of win
ning was 15.6 percent. And in 2011,
when the Clippers won the lottery
but traded the unprotected pick to
the Cavaliers as a part of the Baron
Davis kerfuffle (netting enigmatic
is-he-really-a-point-guard Kyrie
Irving), the Clippaliers' probability
of winning was 2.8 percent.
As a proud student of CS 109,1
can tell you that, assuming that the
lottery each year is independent, the
overall probability of winning in
those three years given the above
odds, is approximately .0074256 per
cent. Seven-thousandths of a per
cent. Wow.
On the whole, I am a very ration
al human being, and I (mostly) be
lieve the NBA when it says that the
draft lottery process is above re
proach. But the sequence of events
over the last few years is getting just
a little bit outrageous. In 2011, at the
end of the first post-Leßron year in
Cleveland, the Cavaliers, who were
atrocious all season and still reeling
from Leßron's betrayal (sobs), just
happen to win the lottery?
The year after, the league-owned
New Orleans Hornets/Pelicans, in
dire need of a quick infusion of talent
in order to be palatable to potential
buyers, just happen to win the lot
tery? And, for the sake of complet
ing this conspiracy theory, the last
two years, Cleveland, even still reel
ing from "The Decision," once again
wins the lottery, giving it access to
major talent at the same time that
Leßron James can opt out of his
contract in Miami, setting the
stage for a triumphant homecom
ing as the once and future savior of
the Cavaliers franchise? If I had a
beard, I would stroke it.
Now, I'm not saying that David
Stern is Chancellor
Palpatine/Darth Sidious/Evil Em
peror, and I'm certainly not saying
that Adam Silver is Anakin Sky
walkei'/Darth Yader. I think Don
ald Sterling has already staked his
claim to the vacant "villain" spot in
the parking lot that is the NBA.
However, one cannot help but won
der how much these storylines im
prove the NBA's ratings.
For the diehard fans, watching
the NBA is a ritual, something
that they will do year in and year
out, without needing any incentive
to turn on the TV or semi-legally
stream the games online (I'm look
ing at you, college students with
out cable). But for casual fans,
over an 82-game regular season,
atrophy starts to set in. They need
some inspiration to tune in, some
motivation that inspires them to
stop watching Pretty Little Liars
and start watching the NBA on
TNT/ESPN/ABC/CSN.
As a casual fan, if I told you that
Leßron James was returning to
Cleveland to join forces with Kyrie
Irving, Tristan Thompson, Antho
ny Bennett (or whoever they trade
him for), Joel Embiid and Ander
son Varejao, you would immedi
ately jump for joy and tune in for
sure. Another Leßron James
backstabbing? The return of the
prodigal son? God not hating
Cleveland sports anymore? The
cliched-headline-generator at
ESPN would explode from pure
happiness.
All jokes aside, the one truth to
be gleaned from the lottery
process over the last few years is
simple: the ping-pong ball ap
proach is most definitely broken. I
can't claim to have or even know of
a better strategy than the lottery,
at least none that minimize the
benefits of "tanking," a process
perfected this season by the
abysmal Philadelphia 76ers, who
were rewarded for their awful
record with the third pick in what
may be a four-superstar draft.
As it is currently structured,
the lottery hasn't really induced
any kind of team improvement;
save for the Oklahoma City Thun
der and maybe the Portland Trail
Blazers, teams that have tried to
build through the draft have con
tinued to, for lack of a better word,

suck. In a perfect world, the
NBA talent distribution
would converge towards
perfect parity, a trend that
is impossible in the real
world given players' egos
and preferences, the deep
pockets of big market
teams, the existence of the
salary cap and the harsh
penalties for exceeding it.
I'm not sure what process
can help us get to that per

feet scenario, but it is clear
that the lottery is not the
answer.
Maybe we should just let
the NBA put players wher
ever it thinks they should
go. Oh wait... they are al
ready doing that anyway.

There's a seven-thousandths
percent chance that Vignesh
Venkataraman gets drafted
by the Cleveland Cavaliers in
the NBA Draft next month.
But probability didn't stop the
Cavs in the lottery, so send
along your C-Tmm restau
