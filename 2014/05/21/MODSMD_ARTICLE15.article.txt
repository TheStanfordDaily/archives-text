# WEDNESDAY ROUNDTABLE
## WEIGHING IN ON SCHEDULE DEBATE 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
One of the mo re polarizing is
sues gripping the college football
world, as of late is the length of
conference schedules in power
conferences across the country.
Next season, the ACC and SEC
will be sticking with an eight
game conference schedule while
the other power conferences will
be utilizing a presumably tougher
nine-game conference schedule,
bringing into question factors
like parity and strength of sched
ule as the College Football Playoff
looms. This decision has brought
harsh criticism from many, most
notably including Stanford's
David, Shaw and Alabama's Nick
Saban. With that, in mind,, we
asked football writers Vihan Lak
shman, David Cohn and Michael
Peterson what, they thought about
the debate and where they stood.

Vihan: The ACC and the SEC
clearly get it: do as little as possible and
still achieve your ultimate goals. Isn't
that what America is all about? If
you're the big bully on the playground,
what incentive do you possibly have to

go fight someone bigger? Just help
yourself to a large dose of Savannah
State and ride your reputation all the
way to the Promised Land.
Sure, people will support nine
game conference schedules using lofty
language like "better for the sport"
and "more exciting matchups." But
that's not the point. The point is to get
to December with a zero in the loss col
umn. In other words to quote the
patron saint of football, A1 Davis
"Just win, baby."
If the Pac-12 really wants to prove
that its a premier conference and pos
sibly even better than the big boys
down South, it should schedule eight
conference games hell, seven con
ference games â€”to maximize the
chance of going undefeated. With the
College Football Playoff relying on a
selection committee to choose teams as
opposed to a computer formula, repu
tation, factors like money and the over
all sexiness of a team will win out over
"strength of schedule."
A two-loss Stanford team that de
feated Oregon, UCLA and the 1972
Miami Dolphins would not be chosen
over an undefeated Alabama or Flori
da State or even a Notre Dame team in
