# WEDNESDAY ROUNDTABLE
## WEIGHING IN ON SCHEDULE DEBATE 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
One of the mo re polarizing is
sues gripping the college football
world, as of late is the length of
conference schedules in power
conferences across the country.
Next season, the ACC and SEC
will be sticking with an eight
game conference schedule while
the other power conferences will
be utilizing a presumably tougher
nine-game conference schedule,
bringing into question factors
like parity and strength of sched
ule as the College Football Playoff
looms. This decision has brought
harsh criticism from many, most
notably including Stanford's
David, Shaw and Alabama's Nick
Saban. With that, in mind,, we
asked football writers Vihan Lak
shman, David Cohn and Michael
Peterson what, they thought about
the debate and where they stood.

Vihan: The ACC and the SEC
clearly get it: do as little as possible and
still achieve your ultimate goals. Isn't
that what America is all about? If
you're the big bully on the playground,
what incentive do you possibly have to

go fight someone bigger? Just help
yourself to a large dose of Savannah
State and ride your reputation all the
way to the Promised Land.
Sure, people will support nine
game conference schedules using lofty
language like "better for the sport"
and "more exciting matchups." But
that's not the point. The point is to get
to December with a zero in the loss col
umn. In other words to quote the
patron saint of football, A1 Davis
"Just win, baby."
If the Pac-12 really wants to prove
that its a premier conference and pos
sibly even better than the big boys
down South, it should schedule eight
conference games hell, seven con
ference games â€”to maximize the
chance of going undefeated. With the
College Football Playoff relying on a
selection committee to choose teams as
opposed to a computer formula, repu
tation, factors like money and the over
all sexiness of a team will win out over
"strength of schedule."
A two-loss Stanford team that de
feated Oregon, UCLA and the 1972
Miami Dolphins would not be chosen
over an undefeated Alabama or Flori
da State or even a Notre Dame team in


LUIS AGUILAR/The Stanford Daily
In the Pac-12 spring coaches' teleconference on May 1, head
coach David Shaw (above) had some choice words forthe ACC
and SEC regarding their eight-game conference schedules.
some proximity to the top 10,
regardless of how many Car
dinal supporters are on the
committee. Sure, fewer
power conference matchups
will severely dilute the sport,
deprive fans of many monu
mental matchups and make
college football borderline
unwatchable, but, some
times, you gotta do what you
gotta do.
David: Personally, I do
not feel that an eight-game
versus a nine-game confer
ence schedule really changes
the math in selecting the first
"Final Four" for the 2015
College Football Playoff.
Like in the BCS system, the
playoff committee will heavi
ly consider conference repu
tation in making its selec
tions. Thus, until one of the
other power conferences
knocks the Southeastern
Conference off its perch over
an extended period of time,
an SEC school will undoubt
edly be featured in the play
off and most likely receive a
top-two seed.
In turn, the ACC cannot
really do anything to combat
the notion that at least three
conferences in the country
(SEC, Pae-12, Big 12) are

simply better football confer
ences from top to bottom.
Florida State's national
championship win aside, over
the 16-season BCS era, the
ACC had an absolutely atro
cious record in BCS bowl
games at 5-13. That .278 win
ning percentage was by far
the worst record of any con
ference in the period. Fur
thermore, three of those five
wins came from FSU.
Secondly, it is rather hyp
ocritical of Nick Saban to
criticize his conference's
eight game conference
schedule and then go out and
schedule the likes of South
ern Mississippi (1-11 in 2013,
0-12 in 2012), Florida At
lantic (6-6 in 2013,3-9 in 2012)
and Western Carolina (FCS
school) this season. While
Crimson Tide fans may point
to their neutral site game in
Atlanta against West Vir
ginia as a significant test, we
all know the crowd is going to
be heavily in favor of the
Tide. Furthermore, the
Mountaineers were at the
bottom of the Big 12 last year
with a 4-8 overall record, and
a 2-7 mark in conference play.
Again, I do not believe
that the number of confer
ence games will ultimately
affect the selection of worthy
teams, but I would simply
ask that if a coach is going to
bemoan his team's eight
game conference slate, then
that coach should back up his

complaints with his schedul
ing.
Michael: In some ways, I
agree with Vihan. If you can
increase your odds of making
it to the national champi
onship game by playing
much easier competition,
then by all means do it.
But you can't call yourself
the top conference in the na
tion with only eight confer
ence games when nearly
everyone else challenges
themselves with nine. One
less conference game a year
doesn't sound like much at all
until you recognize that
every few years, at least for
the SEC, that means taking
LSU or Alabama or Auburn
or South Carolina or Texas
A&M off your schedule. Can
you imagine how Stanford
would have fared if it played
one less conference game in
2010 or 2011 and that game
was against Oregon (yes,
they're in the same division,
but for the sake of specula
tion, go along with it)? Or this
season against USC? The
Cardinal might have added
another conference title in
2010 or 2011 and potentially
even a national championship
title to its collection.
The SEC every year con
tinues to claim that it is the
cream of the crop, yet it
avoids challenging itself if at
all possible. For the previous
seven years before Florida

State won the title this sea
son, the SEC produced the
best team in the country. But
if you add in just one more
conference game, who knows
how long the streak would
have lasted?
Naturally, every confer
ence game can easily swing in
either team's favor Utah
should provide plenty of evi
dence for Cardinal fans. A ri
valry or a quest for revenge
can easily provide enough
motivation to spark an un
derdog into a battle with a
higher-ranked team.
It seems like Stanford is
begging to play USC and
Oregon each year to prove its
worth against the highest
caliber of opponents. Yet the
best of the SEC dread facing
each other. Want to call your
self the best conference in
the nation? Prove it by will
ingly facing the best, and
stop complaining about it.

Deep down inside, Vihan
Lakshrnan, David Cohn and
Michael Peterson are all more
excited for Stanford's August
30 matchup against UC-
Davis than any other game on
the team's schedule this year
and wish they could have just
one more exciting non-confer
ence matchup to look forward
to. Suggest another fear-in
ducing non-conference oppo
nent at vihan@stanford.edu,
