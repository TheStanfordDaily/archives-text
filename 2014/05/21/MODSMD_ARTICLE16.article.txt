# MEN FINISH FOURTH
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
The No. 12 Stanford men's rowing team just
barely missed the third-place finish that it had
strived for at the Pac-12 Rowing Championships
last weekend at Lake Natoma, California, get
ting edged out by two points by the third-place
team, No. 14 Oregon State. The Cardinal ended
up finishing in fourth.

"The goal was to get third place," said head
coach Craig Amerkhanian. "Every member of
our program raced today so that was great. Un
fortunately, we had two boats get outsprinted
and that was tough. We have a lot of work to do
to get ready for nationals."
Heavy favorites and the traditional rowing
powerhouses of the West Coast, No. 1 Washing
ton and No. 2 California took first and second
overall.

Stanford, however, did medal in the IVB
event, bringing home a bronze and qualifying
the team for the Intercollegiate Rowing Associ
ation (IRA) National Championship. The Cardi
nal got out to a quick start with a 1:24.42 split in
the first 500 meters, as they jumped to third be
hind Cal and Washington and were able to hold
off Oregon State for the remainder of the race.
"We were pretty serious underdogs coming
in to the race," said senior Austin Hack. "We
wanted to come out and go as hard as we could
and stick with it. We had a really good first 500
meters and then it was just staying in third to
lock up a qualify spot for IRAs."
The 2VB and frosh eight narrowly missed out
on third place finishes themselves, instead each
placing fourth after allowing Oregon State to
sprint past them in both races in the final 500 me
ters despite sitting in third for the majority of
the race.
On the upside, head coach Craig Amerkhan
ian was able to give more rowers competition
time on the water by fielding a varsity four boat
for the first time this spring. The varsity four fin
ished fifth in the event.
"The varsity four was just put together so
great racing by those guys," Amerkhanian said.
"I am really proud of those guys."
The men will continue to work on different
lineups and improve on last weekend's perform
ances in preparations for the IRA National
Championships. Both the IVB and 2VB boats
qualified for the championships. The regatta be
gins Friday, May 30 in West Windsor, New Jer
sey.
