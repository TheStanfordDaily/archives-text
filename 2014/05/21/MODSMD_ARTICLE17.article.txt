# A 						CREW OF SCHOLARS
## Hack, Fauci earn Pac-12 honors 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
Seniors Austin Hack of the men's
rowing team and Ali Fauci of the
women's rowing team became Stan
ford's fifth and sixth athletes this ac
ademic year to earn Pac-12 Scholar-
Athlete of the Year honors, the con
ference announced on Sunday.
Hack, majoring in political sci
ence and minoring in modern lan
guage with a 3.766 GPA, has been
renowned for his leadership and
contributions to his team through
out his career at Stanford, as he was
named the Pac-12 Men's Rowing
Athlete of the Year in 2013 and his
sport's conference Newcomer of the
Year in 2012. He earned All-Pac-12
honors in both seasons.
"It is definitely a huge honor,"
Hack said. "I have been recognized
for my rowing accomplishments, but
it feels good to be recognized aca
demically. I know there are a lot of
smart guys on our team and other
teams as well so it is an honor to re
ceive this award."
Hack has also earned two Pac-12
All-Academic selections prior to this
year. He is the third Stanford men's
rower to be granted the sport's Pac
-12 Scholar-Athlete of the Year
award.

"He is the top collegiate rower in
America this year," said Stanford
head coach Craig Amei'khanian.
"He came to us as a brilliant and fo
cused scholar. He would have gotten
into Stanford with or without row
ing. He is special and is what our
program has always been about."

Fauci also became the third
Stanford student-athlete to be
awarded Pac-12 Women's Rowing

Scholar-Athlete of the Year. The
computer science major ended the
winter quarter with a 4.053 GPA and
will work at Twitter next year. She is
also a two-time Pac-12 All-Academic
honoree and two-time recipient of
the Collegiate Rowing Coaches As
sociation (CRCA) Scholar-Athlete
Award.

"It is an incredible honor just to
be a student-athlete at Stanford,"

Fauci said. "It is exciting to be recog
nized by the Pac-12, but we have an
incredible team of scholar-athletes
who all deserve the honor as much
as I do."
During her freshman year, Fauci
walked on to the women's rowing
team and worked her way up to be
coming a member of the IVB boat

that took home first in the
Pac-12 Championships last
weekend.
"She got into Stanford on
her own. She had experience
but she is only 5-foot-8. She
went from not rowing fast to
being very fast and she did
that on her own," said head
coach Yasmin Farooq. "Row
ing at this level is a major
time commitment. She is a
role model for every person

on the team, the way she
works hard at practice and in
the classroom. She does it all
right and we are really going
to miss her."
The other Cardinal ath
letes who have been named
Pac-12 Scholar-Athletes of
the Year for the 2013-2014
season are seniors Chiney
