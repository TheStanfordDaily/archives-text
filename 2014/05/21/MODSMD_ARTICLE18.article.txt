## Patrick Rodgers wins Ben Hogan Award 
### â€“ Cameron Miller 
In a move that surprised few in
the golf world, Stanford junior
Patrick Rodgers was awarded the
coveted Ben Hogan Award on Sun
day, the highest honor for an Amer
ican amateur collegian. Essentially
the highest honor of collegiate
men's golf, the Ben Hogan Award
has been handed out annually since
its inception in 1990 and its name
sake is one of the great American
golfing pioneers. It is meant to
honor "the outstanding male ama
teur and collegiate golfer of the
year" and is sponsored by Colonial
Country Club (where the award
ceremony was held), the Friends of

Golf and the Golf Coaches Associa
tion of America.
Rodgers, who announced in
March his intention to turn profes
sional at the end of the spring sea
son, has had a truly outstanding
2014 campaign that has included six
individual wins and nine top-10
tournament finishes. The Avon, In
diana, native really started to turn
the corner when the team returned
for the spring portion of its sched
ule, which has seen him rattle off
five wins in his last six starts while
placing second in the other. He
claimed medalist honors at the Pac
-12 Championships an effort for

which he was awarded Pac-12 Play
er of the Year and also at the re
cent NCAA Eugene Regional. As a
finalist for the award in 2012 as well,
Rodgers heads into this week's
NCAA Championships as one of the
favorites for the individual crown.
Stanford senior Cameron Wil
son, the sixth-ranked amateur
golfer in the world, was also a final
ist and accompanied Rodgers and
Cardinal head coach Conrad Ray to
Fort Worth, Texas, for the festivi
ties. Wilson, who has recorded top
-10 individual finishes in all but one
event this season, has been an im
peccably steady performer in Ray's

lineup for much of the past three
seasons. Preparing to graduate
with a degree in history in June,
Wilson too plans to turn profession
al sometime this summer and take
the next steps toward earning PGA
Tour status.
In addition to the notoriety and
hardware, Rodgers was given a
sponsor exemption to next year's
PGA Tour Colonial event and
$25,000 to be used by the men's golf
program. By virtue of being a final
ist, Wilson also earned $12,500 for
Ray's squad.
