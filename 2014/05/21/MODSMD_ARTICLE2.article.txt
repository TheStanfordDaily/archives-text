# Human rights center comes to campus
## Opportunities for international law internships to increase 
### JOSIE HODSON DESK EDITOR 
The WSD Handa Center for Human
Rights and International Justice, which has
been housed at UC-Berkeley since 2000, re
cently relocated to Stanford's campus, where
it will work within Stanford Global Studies
(SGS).
The Center, previously known as the War
Crimes Studies Center, focuses on the field of
International Humanitarian Law and is com
mitted to working directly with post-conflict
societies and conducting research. According
to its website, the Center is "dedicated to pro
moting the rule of law, accountability and
human rights around the world."
"We've always been focused on reaching
places that are under-noticed or under-dis
cussed," said Penelope Van Tuyl, the associate
director of the Center.
This philosophy has sent students and
young lawyers all over the world, including to
places like Cambodia, Bangladesh, Indonesia

and Sierra Leone.
According to David Cohen, the director of
the Center, the transition was made possible
by the Worldwide Support for Development
Foundation and the Stanford Dean of Human
ities and Sciences.
Van Tuyl and Cohen both said that moving
operations to Stanford would provide more
opportunities, allowing the Center to increase
its programming. Stanford's resources will
only further the Center's already impressive
reach around the world.
"There are lots of benefits," Van Tuyl said.
"We will be joining a network of centers.
There will be a built-in platform, a home
base."
Those who sign up for internships through
the Center are sent to post-conflict areas to
monitor and write about war crime tribunal
proceedings.
One student, Daniel Mattes 'l2, found out
about the Center through Cohen, who has
been a visiting professor at Stanford for the
past three years, while it was still located at

Berkeley. After taking Cohen's class on inter
national tribunals in the spring of 2011,
Mattes became involved with the Handa Cen
ter, and after his graduation in 2012, he was
flown to Cambodia to monitor the Khmer
Rouge tribunal.
As an intern with the Center, Mattes was
able to produce meaningful work. Each week,
after taking copious notes during the proceed
ings, he compiled that week's worth of record
ings into a report. From these notes he
worked with Khmer Mekong Films, a major
film and television company in Phnom Penh,
to broadcast a weekly show on the tribunal

proceedings. Through the show, Cambodian
news journalists could present important in
formation to the public a population other
wise often kept in the dark about such pro
ceedings.
According to Mattes, the opportunity to
spend seven months in Cambodia was a
tremendous one.
"[lt] really opened me up to a lot of sub
jects and people that I hadn't ever thought of
pursuing before," he said. "I had only ever
studied Cambodia in class, about the genocide
