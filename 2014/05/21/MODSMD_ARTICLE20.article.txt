# Pac-12 university presidents seek changes for student-athletes
## 
### â€“ Cameron Miller 
In a development that could has
ten major change in the current
NCAA student-athlete experience,
the university presidents from Pac
-12 schools have written a joint letter
to their counterparts at the other
so-called power conferences the
ACC, Big 10, Big 12 and SEC
that calls for a significant overhaul
of the NCAA framework.
"We acknowledge the core ob
jectives could prove to be expensive
and controversial, but the risks of
inaction or moving too slowly are far
greater," the letter states. "The
time for tinkering with the rules and
making small adjustments is over."
The document, which was
obtained by media outlets
Tuesday night, lists 10 pro
posed changes to NCAA
rules and to how the five con
ferences act within them.
Among the proposals are
changes to the maximum
amount of hours per week
athletes are allowed to prac
tice. The current limit of 20
hours when a sport is in sea
son is often exceeded without
impunity, forcing student

athletes to miss out on vari
ous academic, social and
other on-campus opportuni
ties.
In addition, the letter
calls for a relaxation of re
strictive transfer rules that
force athletes to lose a year of
eligibility if their former
schools refuse to release
them from their scholar
ships.
Another change de
scribed in the letter is
"providfing] student-ath
letes a meaningful role in
governance at the conference
and NCAA levels," a propos
al which has heightened
salience given the increas

ingly profitable nature of col
legiate athletics. The presi
dents also want the NBA to
reassess its minimum age of
19 years, a rule that has given
root to the "one and done"
trend seen in the past five to
10 years. This proposal goes
along with the presidents'
goal to "reassert the academ
ic primacy of our mission."
But perhaps the most im
portant proposed amend
ment to NCAA rules outlined
in the letter has to do with un
capping and raising the dol
lar amount of scholarships so
that they not only cover
room, board and tuition but
also the everyday expenses

that college students incur.
The idea of providing stu
dent-athletes an extra
stipend has been in the works
for years, but the larger,
more well-endowed Division
I schools have been consis
tently outvoted by their more
numerous, smaller and less
financially endowed peers.
This tension feeds into the
power conferences' desire to
have more autonomy within
the NCAA, so change in the
organizational structure of
the Mark Emmert-led insti
tution may also be on the
horizon.
