## 
### â€“ Cameron Miller 
In a development that could has
ten major change in the current
NCAA student-athlete experience,
the university presidents from Pac
-12 schools have written a joint letter
to their counterparts at the other
so-called power conferences the
ACC, Big 10, Big 12 and SEC
that calls for a significant overhaul
of the NCAA framework.
"We acknowledge the core ob
jectives could prove to be expensive
and controversial, but the risks of
inaction or moving too slowly are far
greater," the letter states. "The
time for tinkering with the rules and
making small adjustments is over."
