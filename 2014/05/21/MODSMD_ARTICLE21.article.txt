## "Still the Water" overdoes symbolism 
### ALEXANDRA HEENEY MANAGING EDITOR 
Last week at the press conference,
the President of the Jury for the Offi
cial Competition, Jane Campion the
only woman to have won the Palme
d'Or, the festival's most prestigious
prize made comments about how
the film industry is very much still a
boy's club. In fact, last year's competi
tion featured no female directors and
this year's features only two, so it's no
surprise that there's been much hub
bub about how Naomi Kawase's "Still
the Water" could be a frontrunner for
the Palme. It certainly is the sort of film
that tends to get rewarded at Cannes.
It feels to me like it's trying almost too
hard at times it is pointedly aimed at
being poetic in addition to tenderly
made and beautifully shot. Critiques
aside, its success would mean another
landmark win for a woman.
The film is a story of two families
told through the eyes of two adoles
cents falling in love: Kyoko (Jun Yoshi
naga) and Kaito (Nijiro Murakami).
Unlike Kaito, Kyoko is an only child in a
family full of love and affection. For ex
ample, we see them on a lazy afternoon,
lovingly resting in each other's laps
Kyoko in her mother's and her mother
in her father's. They're helping each
other through a difficult time as
Kyoko's mother is dying of an unex
plained illness. Near the beginning of
the film, in fact, we see them preparing
her hospital bed for her to come home
to, setting it up to face a 400-year-old
tree.
Kyoko is in love with Kaito, the kind
boy-next-door who often gives her lifts
on his bicycle she stands on the
back with her hands on his shoulders
as he peddles. This is one of the film's
most potent images, as they ride
quickly on the road with the beach in
the background, recalling Antoine
Doinel's famous last run toward free
dom in "The 400 Blows" and the exu

berance of the boy with the bike in the
Darennes' film. Kaito also loves
Kyoko, but he's hesitant to express it.
When she suggests they make love, he,
to her confusion, is reluctant. Unlike
Kyoko, he's from a broken home, and
after watching his parents' marriage
dissolve and his mother jump from
man to man, he's afraid that Kyoko's
affections might be only temporary.
The film's best scenes are those
showing the two of them tentatively
exploring them feelings. Sitting by the
water in crepuscular light, she makes a
provocative comment about the way
the sea is like making love and quickly
kisses him. Kawase pushes the camera
in close to them, lingering on the duo
long after they've kissed, as they sit,
foreheads touching, caressing. If there
were ever a perfect image of first love,
this would be it.
Kawase is very much concerned
with the passage of time and with the
cycles of life. It's telling that the first
images of the film are of waves lapping
toward the shore, a party with dancing
and then a goat's throat being slit. She
practically bulldozes you with the con
cepts of permanence and imperma
nence, and thus the importance of seiz
ing the moment. Sometimes, this overt
juxtaposition yields deeply moving
scenes: When family and friends sere
nade and dance for Kyoko's mother on
her death bed, Kawase turns her focus
from the placid, contented face of the
mother to the joyous dancing. But the
pervasive obvious imagery makes the
film annoyingly predictable, and it be
comes an excuse for avoiding deeper
character development. "Still the
Water" is such a forced attempt at cre
ating art Kawase has even de
scribed it as her masterpiece that it
never quite achieves greatness. As a
Cannes prospect, it might be dead in
the water.
