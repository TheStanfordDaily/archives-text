## PETA exhibit promotes animal rights The 						Glass Walls exhibit showcases the horrors of animal abuse on farms 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Passersby in White Plaza early this week
were greeted with vegan cookies and ap
proached with the opportunity to learn more
about factory farms through the Glass Walls
exhibit, which featured video of animal slaugh
ters, facts about animal abuse in farms and
even a life-sized battery cage filled with fake
chickens.
People for Animal Welfare (PAW), a student
organization founded during winter quarter,
brought the Glass Walls exhibit to campus in
collaboration with People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals (PETA) with the goal of
promoting awareness on campus of animal
rights issues and further expanding the
group's presence.
According to Kenneth Montville, college
campaign coordinator for PETA, the Glass
Walls exhibit has already made its way to over
70 colleges in the United States, including Yale,
UC-San Diego, UCLA, Georgetown and
Texas. Stanford was the second-to-last stop of
this specific exhibit, before a new rendition will
be released next fall.
The mission of Glass Walls closely aligns
with that of PAt\( which is why David Kay 'l6,
president of PAW( and first-year law student
Eitan Fischer, a member of the group, worked
to bring the Glass Walls to Stanford.
"We grow up with this fairytale of a happy
red barn on beautiful green pastures, but that
isn't the reality," said Sacha Sweet, administra
tor of the touring exhibit. "We want this exhibit
to show that, and to show people the amount and
propensity of abuse these animals go through
every day. People need to see these real images
and know the truth for themselves."
Fischer, who experienced Glass Walls while
an undergraduate at Yale, initially suggested
the idea,
"We had an overwhelmingly positive re
sponse when we hosted [The] Glass Walls at
Yale," he said. "We had hundreds of students
go through, and many of them expressed that
they had never known this information before.
Given PAW's new role on campus, this exhibit
was a great way to increase its presence while
educating the Stanford community on an im
portant issue."
Currently, PAW is the only undergraduate
group on campus that is focused exclusively on
animal welfare. So far, PAW's two main strate
gies for accomplishing its mission to reduce an
imal suffering are lobbying institutions on cam
pus to be more humane and raising awareness,
Kay explained. The goal is to expose the suffer
ing endured by animals and to provide people

with easy ways that they can make an impact.
Although PAW only officially became a club
last quarter, it has made a considerable impact
despite their limited resources and size.
"We hand out leaflets with tips on how to go
vegan," Kay said. "We've cosponsored events
that raise awareness of the dog meat festival in
China or about the ag-gag laws in the United
States. We met with Challah for Hunger and
urged them to offer a vegan flavor."

With funding granted a few days ago, PAW
plans to expand its presence in various ways.
"We're planning on volunteering at an ani
mal shelter, having some sort of activism [or]
awareness event on the orcas at Sea World and
maybe even campaigning for animal-friendly
politicians," Kay said.
