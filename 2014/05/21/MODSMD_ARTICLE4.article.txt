## Relay for Life exceeds expectations Cancer fundraiser raises $80,114.51 over weekend 
### HANA KAJIMURA 
John Newcomb 'l6 watched his
brown curly locks fall to the ground as
his fellow Relay for Life committee
members took turns with the clippers.
"I swore that if we got to $50,000,1
would shave my head," Newcomb said.
Maybe he should have aimed higher.
Stanford's Relay for Life this weekend
raised $80,114.51 and drew 611 partici
pants. Donations are still rolling in.
The story of Relay for Life at Stan
ford has been one of reinvention, and
this year was no exception.
With two members of the executive
committee, Eileen Mariano 'l5 and
Alex Gari 'l5, studying abroad this fall,
the Relay committee had to figure out
how to manage dozens of volunteers
with their co-chairs only accessible
through Skype.
The other half of the committee,
John Newcomb 'l6 and Hailey
Juszczak 'l5, put together a system
that unified three sub-committees
under the broader pillars of of "produc
tion," "fight back" or "growth." The
new system encouraged collaborative
brainstorming rather than top-down
delegation.
Jessie Stuart 'l4, now a senior, re
members how Relay was run her fresh
man year.
"It used to be five to 10 people sit
ting in a room, throwing out ideas,"
Stuart said. "They've reorganized it to
encourage collaboration and accounta
bility."
The Relay committee faced another
potential roadblock when the Frost
Music and Arts Festival was also sched
uled for May 17. As chair of the Team
Development Committee, Stuart had
to tweak event marketing.
"Frost is so physically close to the
track on campus," Stuart said. "People
could come walk at Relay in the morn
ing and come back for the Luminaria
Ceremony at night."
Once the sun sets at a Relay for Life
event, decorated paper bags filled with
candles called "luminaria" are lit in re
membrance of loved ones lost to or
fighting against cancer. The ceremony
itself allows cancer survivors and care
takers to share their stories, and also
creates a space for all participants to
remember their experiences with
cancer.
Against the stadium bleachers
at Cobb Track & Angell Field this
weekend, the luminaria spelled out
"hope" and "cure" as students cir
cled the track.
This year, the ceremony fea
tured three speakers: Jessie Stuart
'l4, Chris Jackson 'l4 and Margaret
Tomaszczuk 'l6 spoke about what
the disease has taught them as both
caretakers and survivors.
"It reduces you to an animal-like
state where the only thing you care
about is surviving," Stuart said. "I
don't think anybody should have to
live like that."
Stuart, a two-time cancer sur
vivor, went on to complete all 105
laps of a full marathon that night.
Jackson's message was univer
sal: Battling cancer taught him to

live every day with intention.
When the speeches were over,
volunteers handed out glow sticks
for another moving ceremony.
"If you are a cancer survivor,
please crack your glow stick now,"
Tomaszczuk said.
Next, those who had lost par
ents, siblings and grandparents
were asked to crack their glow
sticks. Finally, when Tomaszcuk
signaled those who had lost any
loved one to cancer to do the same,
nearly the entire crowd glowed a
bright white.
"You maybe didn't know that
your best friend had cancer or that
your neighbor across the hall lost
his mom when he was 10," New
comb said. "At Luminaria, you start
to realize what an impact you can
have as an individual and as a collec
tive whole against the disease."
Around 10 p.m., a sea of glow
sticks made a silent lap around the
track in remembrance.

Jackson's message was univer
sal: Battling cancer taught him to

live every day with intention.
When the speeches were over,
volunteers handed out glow sticks
for another moving ceremony.
"If you are a cancer survivor,
please crack your glow stick now,"
Tomaszczuk said.
Next, those who had lost par
ents, siblings and grandparents
were asked to crack their glow
sticks. Finally, when Tomaszcuk
signaled those who had lost any
loved one to cancer to do the same,
nearly the entire crowd glowed a
bright white.
"You maybe didn't know that
your best friend had cancer or that
your neighbor across the hall lost
his mom when he was 10," New
comb said. "At Luminaria, you start
to realize what an impact you can
have as an individual and as a collec
tive whole against the disease."
Around 10 p.m., a sea of glow
sticks made a silent lap around the
track in remembrance.
