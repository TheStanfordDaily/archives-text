## ASSU funding deficit still concerns groups 
### PETER MOON DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
During the fourth meeting of the
16th Undergraduate Senate on
Tuesday, several student groups
took up the Senate's previous invita
tion to attend the Senate's weekly
meetings in order to discuss ambi
guities and concerns over general
fees funding, as unrest about the
lack of funding for spring quarter
continues.
The first of these groups was the
Alpha Delta Phi, a literary society,
which filed a complaint over the lack
of clear communication with the
ASSU.
"We've been having a difficult
year with SSE [Student Services
Enterprises] and ASSU," said
Omar Ezzine 'l4, financial manager.
"We're not getting responses. We
have had issues with group registra
tion, budget misrepresentation on
myGroups and receiving informa
tion."
After a series of discussions and
negotiations, the Senate decided to
fund certain line items for Alpha

Delta Phi's upcoming Laker Music
Festival on May 31, including costs
incurred from setting up the stage
for bands. The fraternity will be
funded $2,500 out of a maximum of
$6,000 possible for a general fees
group. However, it will not be receiv
ing spring quarter general fees
funding for security and police,
which is required by events with a
certain threshold of anticipated au
dience.

"The initial rejection of the fund
ing bill submitted by Alpha Delta
Phi was before the bailout when we
really didn't have money at the
time," said chair Ben Holston 'l5.
"However, because we now have
money to allot after the bailout, we
will be funding them $2,500."
Following Alpha Delta Phi, rep
resentatives from Stanford Astro
nomical Society (SAS) came in to
clarify line item funding for tele
scope equipment.
After more discussions, SAS rep
resentative Ari Esters 'l5 stated
that the group had not realized the
Senate was out of money for spring
quarter, a confusion shared by other

student groups.
The Senate decided to fund ap
proximately half of what SAS had
requested for telescope equipment
since SAS had enough funds accu
mulated from their bank account in
previous years.

"The Senate decided to pay for
the difference between the cost we
proposed for the structure and

amount that was remaining on the
old bank account, which turns out to
be approximately half of what we re
quested," Esters said.
Next, sorority members from
Chi Omega discussed funding for
their Wing Fling philanthropy
event, the proceeds of which will be
donated to the Make-a-Wish Foun
dation.

Chi Omega will ultimately be re
ceiving $3,270 from general fees
funding because the Senate agreed
that that proceedings from the
event should go toward the charity
organization and not be used to host
the event, Holston said.
