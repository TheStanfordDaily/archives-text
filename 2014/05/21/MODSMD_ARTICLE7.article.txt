## Public Safety to reorganize bike abatement sales 
### â€“ Caleb Smith 
The Stanford University Department of Public
Safety (SUDPS) anticipates selling an estimated 40
or 50 bikes on Thursday and will be implementing a
new system for taking orders. While in the past, cus
tomers were required to line up at the gates of the
bike lot for a first-come, first-serve opportunity to
buy an abated bike, the SUDPS will now issue num

bered tickets to interested bike buyers.
SUDPS changed the system in an effort to miti
gate past sell-outs, which left interested buyers
empty-handed. Under the new sale system, everyone
who gets a ticket will have the opportunity to buy a
bike, according to bike abatement director Carole
Pierce.
The precise number of bikes on sale is presently
undetermined because University departments have
the opportunity to buy bikes before they are offered
to general public.
