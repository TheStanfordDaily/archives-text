# University streamlines lost and found email system
## 
### â€“ Caleb Smith 
Several University depart
ments have created a dedicated
email address, lostandfoundsu@
stanford.edu, to process lost and
found questions. The joint email ad
dress, which now serves 17 depart
ments, automatically receives

emails and forwards them to point
people in the various departments.
According to Stanford Univer
sity Department of Public Safety
(SUDPS) business operations
manager Jamie Scalero, the email
started as away for departments
to communicate with each other
about lost or found objects, but
has since become a means for the
public to handle lost and found
items.
"It has been pretty helpful...
and a nice resource for the com
munity [to go to]," Scalero said.
Those receiving the emails will
include representatives at the Es
condido Village Front Desk, the
Bing Box Office, Munger, Rains,
Tresidder Union, Governor's
Corner, the Stanford Bookstore,
the janitorial services at Stanford
and the SUDPS.
