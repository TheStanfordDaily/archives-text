## Fans' constant LeBron criticism needs to stop 
### Michael Peterson 
Leßron, I'm sorry I fell vic
tim to the plague that
spread across America, the
one that claims you're a vil
lain and the one that hopes
each and every year to see you fall
short and fail to achieve your goals. For
11 seasons, like much of the United
States, I've rooted against you at every
turn, whether it was cheering for Der
rick Rose or Kevin Durant in the MVP
race or the Mavericks, Thunder and
Spurs in the NBA Finals.
But when I stopped to think about
it, what has Leßron actually done to
deserve this?
Sure, four years ago he went over
the top in declaring his intentions
during free agency. It would have
been much wiser for him to simply
sign the usual way, and especially to
refrain from using the phrase "take
my talents to South Beach." He was
a jerk to Cleveland that night and
came off as arrogant to viewers. But
so what?
The best basketball player in the
world is confident in his abilities and
seemed a little egotistical would
any of us not be a little arrogant if we
were that ridiculously good? Oh and
not to mention that he raised over $3
million for charity by putting on his
supposedly arrogant, condescend
ing show, "The Decision," for ESPN.
Michael Jordan had a gambling
problem. Kobe Bryant was accused,
whether wrongfully or not, of rape,
and arguably has a much bigger ego
than Leßron James ever has or will.
Yet we put so much energy into boo
ing and hating Leßron James for
much less. He has had no ugly marks
on his career thus far.
This year's MVP race almost felt
like a good guy versus bad guy sto
ryline: Kevin Durant, the humble su
perstar (who is very deserving of the
MVP award and the "good guy" per
sona), against Leßron James, the
man labeled as an egotistical villain
who steals NBA titles and awards
from better human beings. I'm ex
tremely happy for Kevin Durant,
and he absolutely deserved to win,
but it's sometimes astonishing that
we're so quick to cheer players and
teams just because they're opposing
Leßron. Rose might have been the
prime example of this in the MVP
voting a few years ago, more so than
Durant this year, who has always
been a universal fan favorite.
While the tale of taking his home
town team from the dumps to the top
would have made for a nicer story
line, Leßron recognized that it
might not have even been possible
given Cleveland's poor coaching,
management and roster. Besides,
every wage earner in America would
jump at the opportunity to work
with his or her closest friends. We
can't fault Leßron for wanting to
play with his known buddies
Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. For
those who claim that Leßron should
have won a title by himself without
teaming up with other superstars,
find me a superstar in recent memo
ry that has won multiple champi
onships, let alone a single one, "on
his own," other than perhaps Dirk
Nowitzki.
Is this simply just a case of the

New York Yankees effect
we hate him because he's just
so darn good? Leßron is ar
guably the greatest all
around athlete in the world,
even though his game isn't
only defined by his athleti
cism. He has post moves to
complement his sneaky good
3-point shooting ability and
otherworldly efficiency from
the field. And of course, he
can blow by you and get to
the rim better than any other
player in the NBA. This is

only a brief description of his
abilities, experience and
defining traits and moments
that could easily fill up a
book.
The saddest part of all is
that the prime of his career
might be over. Leßron is al
ready 29, and in only a few
years, the first articles about
his decline will inevitably be
written. It's only a matter of
how significant of a decline it
will be. The best years of one
of basketball's all-time
greatest players were spent
listening to raucous boos and
suffering from underappre
ciation from basketball fans
everywhere. It's not just that
he's on a different team

great players on opposing
teams often hear from that
team's fans just because
they're good it's clearly
something more.
However, if you take a
step back and look at the
sport of basketball at a
whole, you start to realize
just what a blessing Leßron
is for the game.
On behalf of America, I
would like to apologize to Le-
Bron for the misguided ani
mosity all these years, whose
only crime has been taking
his place amongst the great
est players of all time, and
perhaps, having a little arro
gance along with that. Some
times you don't know what

you have before it's gone. If
fans don't recognize the
thrilling show Leßron puts
on every game and learn to
move past habitual dislike to
appreciate that, it might be
too late to enjoy the greatest
player of this generation. I
know I've already missed out
on part of that.

It's now evident that Michael
Peterson has converted to the
dark side. It'sapity, too, because
he had so much potential, Send
Michael your best home reme
dies to help cure him from the.

that the prime of his career
might be over. Leßron is al
ready 29, and in only a few
years, the first articles about
his decline will inevitably be
written. It's only a matter of
how significant of a decline it
will be. The best years of one
of basketball's all-time
greatest players were spent
listening to raucous boos and
suffering from underappre
ciation from basketball fans
everywhere. It's not just that
he's on a different team

great players on opposing
teams often hear from that
team's fans just because
they're good it's clearly
something more.
However, if you take a
step back and look at the
sport of basketball at a
whole, you start to realize
just what a blessing Leßron
is for the game.
On behalf of America, I
would like to apologize to Le-
Bron for the misguided ani
mosity all these years, whose
only crime has been taking
his place amongst the great
est players of all time, and
perhaps, having a little arro
gance along with that. Some
times you don't know what

you have before it's gone. If
fans don't recognize the
thrilling show Leßron puts
on every game and learn to
move past habitual dislike to
appreciate that, it might be
too late to enjoy the greatest
player of this generation. I
know I've already missed out
on part of that.

Leßron, I'm sorry I fell vic
tim to the plague that
spread across America, the
one that claims you're a vil
lain and the one that hopes
each and every year to see you fall
short and fail to achieve your goals. For
11 seasons, like much of the United
States, I've rooted against you at every
turn, whether it was cheering for Der
rick Rose or Kevin Durant in the MVP
race or the Mavericks, Thunder and
Spurs in the NBA Finals.
But when I stopped to think about
it, what has Leßron actually done to
deserve this?
Sure, four years ago he went over
the top in declaring his intentions
during free agency. It would have
been much wiser for him to simply
sign the usual way, and especially to
refrain from using the phrase "take
my talents to South Beach." He was
a jerk to Cleveland that night and
came off as arrogant to viewers. But
so what?
The best basketball player in the
world is confident in his abilities and
seemed a little egotistical would
any of us not be a little arrogant if we
were that ridiculously good? Oh and
not to mention that he raised over $3
million for charity by putting on his
supposedly arrogant, condescend
ing show, "The Decision," for ESPN.
Michael Jordan had a gambling
problem. Kobe Bryant was accused,
whether wrongfully or not, of rape,
and arguably has a much bigger ego
than Leßron James ever has or will.
Yet we put so much energy into boo
ing and hating Leßron James for
much less. He has had no ugly marks
on his career thus far.
This year's MVP race almost felt
like a good guy versus bad guy sto
ryline: Kevin Durant, the humble su
perstar (who is very deserving of the
MVP award and the "good guy" per
sona), against Leßron James, the
man labeled as an egotistical villain
who steals NBA titles and awards
from better human beings. I'm ex
tremely happy for Kevin Durant,
and he absolutely deserved to win,
but it's sometimes astonishing that
we're so quick to cheer players and
teams just because they're opposing
Leßron. Rose might have been the
prime example of this in the MVP
voting a few years ago, more so than
Durant this year, who has always
been a universal fan favorite.
While the tale of taking his home
town team from the dumps to the top
would have made for a nicer story
line, Leßron recognized that it
might not have even been possible
given Cleveland's poor coaching,
management and roster. Besides,
every wage earner in America would
jump at the opportunity to work
with his or her closest friends. We
can't fault Leßron for wanting to
play with his known buddies
Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. For
those who claim that Leßron should
have won a title by himself without
teaming up with other superstars,
find me a superstar in recent memo
ry that has won multiple champi
onships, let alone a single one, "on
his own," other than perhaps Dirk
Nowitzki.
Is this simply just a case of the

New York Yankees effect
we hate him because he's just
so darn good? Leßron is ar
guably the greatest all
around athlete in the world,
even though his game isn't
only defined by his athleti
cism. He has post moves to
complement his sneaky good
3-point shooting ability and
otherworldly efficiency from
the field. And of course, he
can blow by you and get to
the rim better than any other
player in the NBA. This is

only a brief description of his
abilities, experience and
defining traits and moments
that could easily fill up a
book.
