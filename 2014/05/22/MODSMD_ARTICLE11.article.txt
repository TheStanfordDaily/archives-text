## Fans' constant LeBron criticism needs to stop 
### Michael Peterson 
Leßron, I'm sorry I fell vic
tim to the plague that
spread across America, the
one that claims you're a vil
lain and the one that hopes
each and every year to see you fall
short and fail to achieve your goals. For
11 seasons, like much of the United
States, I've rooted against you at every
turn, whether it was cheering for Der
rick Rose or Kevin Durant in the MVP
race or the Mavericks, Thunder and
Spurs in the NBA Finals.
But when I stopped to think about
it, what has Leßron actually done to
deserve this?
Sure, four years ago he went over
the top in declaring his intentions
during free agency. It would have
been much wiser for him to simply
sign the usual way, and especially to
refrain from using the phrase "take
my talents to South Beach." He was
a jerk to Cleveland that night and
came off as arrogant to viewers. But
so what?
The best basketball player in the
world is confident in his abilities and
seemed a little egotistical would
any of us not be a little arrogant if we
were that ridiculously good? Oh and
not to mention that he raised over $3
million for charity by putting on his
supposedly arrogant, condescend
ing show, "The Decision," for ESPN.
Michael Jordan had a gambling
problem. Kobe Bryant was accused,
whether wrongfully or not, of rape,
and arguably has a much bigger ego
than Leßron James ever has or will.
Yet we put so much energy into boo
ing and hating Leßron James for
much less. He has had no ugly marks
on his career thus far.
This year's MVP race almost felt
like a good guy versus bad guy sto
ryline: Kevin Durant, the humble su
perstar (who is very deserving of the
MVP award and the "good guy" per
sona), against Leßron James, the
man labeled as an egotistical villain
who steals NBA titles and awards
from better human beings. I'm ex
tremely happy for Kevin Durant,
and he absolutely deserved to win,
but it's sometimes astonishing that
we're so quick to cheer players and
teams just because they're opposing
Leßron. Rose might have been the
prime example of this in the MVP
voting a few years ago, more so than
Durant this year, who has always
been a universal fan favorite.
While the tale of taking his home
town team from the dumps to the top
would have made for a nicer story
line, Leßron recognized that it
might not have even been possible
given Cleveland's poor coaching,
management and roster. Besides,
every wage earner in America would
jump at the opportunity to work
with his or her closest friends. We
can't fault Leßron for wanting to
play with his known buddies
Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. For
those who claim that Leßron should
have won a title by himself without
teaming up with other superstars,
find me a superstar in recent memo
ry that has won multiple champi
onships, let alone a single one, "on
his own," other than perhaps Dirk
Nowitzki.
Is this simply just a case of the
