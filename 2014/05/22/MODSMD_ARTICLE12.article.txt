## USMNT ENJOYING STANFORD CAMPUS, TRAINING FACILITIES 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
In just a few weeks, the members of the United
States men's national soccer team will take the field in
front of tens of thousands of rabid fans in Brazil to com
pete in the World Cup with the eyes of the entire world
upon them moments and games that will surely place
among the greatest of their lives. But for the past week,
the national team has called the Stanford campus home
as it has prepared in the confines of Cagan Stadium and
Stanford Stadium to challenge for soccer's ultimate
prize.
"It's unbelievable, it's just beautiful," said national
team head coach Jurgen Klinsmann. "Having this [foot
ball] stadium at our disposal, and then going over to the
soccer stadium, and going back and forth between the
two fields, going to the food places here at campus, mix
ing with the college students, I think [the players] enjoy
that a lot."
The most interaction the players have had with the
students has come in their regular appearances at the
Arrillaga Family Dining Commons. After the morning
training session ends, the players ride in golf carts over
to the dining hall where they eat along with hundreds of
Stanford students.
"It's been really cool seeing them in the cafeteria and
sometimes they come up for pics, and sometimes they're
just coming up to tell us good luck, and it's been really
cool," said midfielder Kyle Beckerman.
"I feel like I'm in a high school movie, just standing
there with my food and it's like, 'Hi, is there some space?'
'Alright, cool, cool,"' said forward Terrence Boyd. "It's
pretty chill and everybody is nice so it's a chill atmos
phere."
However, in addition to the usual Arrillaga food, the
national team brought its own chef along who has helped
design the meals and supplemented the dining hall food.
"I've seen a couple of the Stanford students trying to
sneak in [to the national team's] line but they're blocking
them but I think we can let them go through," Beck
erman said.
A typical day for the players consists of an early
morning run and breakfast before coming to campus.
