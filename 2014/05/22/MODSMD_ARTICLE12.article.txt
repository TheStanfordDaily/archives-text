## USMNT ENJOYING STANFORD CAMPUS, TRAINING FACILITIES 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
In just a few weeks, the members of the United
States men's national soccer team will take the field in
front of tens of thousands of rabid fans in Brazil to com
pete in the World Cup with the eyes of the entire world
upon them moments and games that will surely place
among the greatest of their lives. But for the past week,
the national team has called the Stanford campus home
as it has prepared in the confines of Cagan Stadium and
Stanford Stadium to challenge for soccer's ultimate
prize.
"It's unbelievable, it's just beautiful," said national
team head coach Jurgen Klinsmann. "Having this [foot
ball] stadium at our disposal, and then going over to the
soccer stadium, and going back and forth between the
two fields, going to the food places here at campus, mix
ing with the college students, I think [the players] enjoy
that a lot."
The most interaction the players have had with the
students has come in their regular appearances at the
Arrillaga Family Dining Commons. After the morning
training session ends, the players ride in golf carts over
to the dining hall where they eat along with hundreds of
Stanford students.
"It's been really cool seeing them in the cafeteria and
sometimes they come up for pics, and sometimes they're
just coming up to tell us good luck, and it's been really
cool," said midfielder Kyle Beckerman.
"I feel like I'm in a high school movie, just standing
there with my food and it's like, 'Hi, is there some space?'
'Alright, cool, cool,"' said forward Terrence Boyd. "It's
pretty chill and everybody is nice so it's a chill atmos
phere."
However, in addition to the usual Arrillaga food, the
national team brought its own chef along who has helped
design the meals and supplemented the dining hall food.
"I've seen a couple of the Stanford students trying to
sneak in [to the national team's] line but they're blocking
them but I think we can let them go through," Beck
erman said.
A typical day for the players consists of an early
morning run and breakfast before coming to campus.

Veteran forward London Donovan (above) is no lock to make Jurgen Klinsmann's World
Cup squad, which will head to Brazil in June to face the so-called "Group of Death."
Training begins in the morn
ing and continues until a short
gym session and a break for
lunch. After lunch, the play
ers have been given a locker
room and lounge area to rest
and relax in before again
training through the after
noon until dinner, when they
return to them hotel.
For many of the players,
this is the first time spending
extended time on a college
campus. Thirteen of the 30
players training for the na
tional team played profes
sional soccer directly after
high school rather than at
tending college.
"It's nice to see the college
life since I didn't really expe
rience it myself," Boyd said.
"It's cool to just experience
how it is living on a campus."
"We feel like we go to
Stanford right now," Becker
man added.

Although none of the play
ers on the team have direct
connections to Stanford,
many played college soccer
and some even competed

against the Cardinal. Goal
keeper Nick Rimando and
midfielder Joe Corona at
tended UCLA and San Diego
State, respectively, for some
period of time before turning
professional. Both UCLA and
San Diego State play in the
Pac-12 for men's soccer; a
total of 16 members of the na
tional team played collegiate
soccer in the United States,
including four at the Univer
sity of Maryland.
When they're not roaming
campus or in their hotels, the
players are busy shaping into
form for the World Cup. The
camp serves not only as away
for Klinsmann to select his
final 23-man squad, but more
importantly, to give the play
ers top-notch preparation for
the World Cup and the envi

ronment ahead in Brazil. The
location for the camp is al
ways strategically chosen in
an attempt to replicate the
weather that the team will
face at the World Cup, and of
course to provide top-notch
facilities for training.
"Logistically, we couldn't
be at a better place," Klins
mann said. "The climate
it's dry, it's fresh and we can
push the guys, and this is
what the campaign here at
Stanford is about: Push them
to their limits absolutely be
cause we have to build the
foundation for the World
Cup."

The team will continue to
train on campus until its
friendly against Azerbaijan at
Candlestick Park next Tues
day night. After that, the na
tional team will travel to New
Jersey for another pre-World
Cup match against Turkey on
June 1 and to Jacksonville for
a game against Nigeria on
June 7. These three matches
will provide the final tune-ups
before the first World Cup
match takes place on June 16
against Ghana in Recife,
Brazil.

the national team has called the Stanford campus home
as it has prepared in the confines of Cagan Stadium and
Stanford Stadium to challenge for soccer's ultimate
prize.
"It's unbelievable, it's just beautiful," said national
team head coach Jurgen Klinsmann. "Having this [foot
ball] stadium at our disposal, and then going over to the
soccer stadium, and going back and forth between the
two fields, going to the food places here at campus, mix
ing with the college students, I think [the players] enjoy
that a lot."
The most interaction the players have had with the
students has come in their regular appearances at the
Arrillaga Family Dining Commons. After the morning
training session ends, the players ride in golf carts over
to the dining hall where they eat along with hundreds of
Stanford students.
"It's been really cool seeing them in the cafeteria and
sometimes they come up for pics, and sometimes they're
just coming up to tell us good luck, and it's been really
cool," said midfielder Kyle Beckerman.
"I feel like I'm in a high school movie, just standing
there with my food and it's like, 'Hi, is there some space?'
'Alright, cool, cool,"' said forward Terrence Boyd. "It's
pretty chill and everybody is nice so it's a chill atmos
phere."
However, in addition to the usual Arrillaga food, the
national team brought its own chef along who has helped
design the meals and supplemented the dining hall food.
"I've seen a couple of the Stanford students trying to
sneak in [to the national team's] line but they're blocking
them but I think we can let them go through," Beck
erman said.
A typical day for the players consists of an early
morning run and breakfast before coming to campus.

Veteran forward London Donovan (above) is no lock to make Jurgen Klinsmann's World
Cup squad, which will head to Brazil in June to face the so-called "Group of Death."
Training begins in the morn
ing and continues until a short
gym session and a break for
lunch. After lunch, the play
ers have been given a locker
room and lounge area to rest
and relax in before again
training through the after
noon until dinner, when they
return to them hotel.
For many of the players,
this is the first time spending
extended time on a college
campus. Thirteen of the 30
players training for the na
tional team played profes
sional soccer directly after
high school rather than at
tending college.
"It's nice to see the college
life since I didn't really expe
rience it myself," Boyd said.
"It's cool to just experience
how it is living on a campus."
"We feel like we go to
Stanford right now," Becker
man added.

Although none of the play
ers on the team have direct
connections to Stanford,
many played college soccer
and some even competed

against the Cardinal. Goal
keeper Nick Rimando and
midfielder Joe Corona at
tended UCLA and San Diego
State, respectively, for some
period of time before turning
professional. Both UCLA and
San Diego State play in the
Pac-12 for men's soccer; a
total of 16 members of the na
tional team played collegiate
soccer in the United States,
including four at the Univer
sity of Maryland.
When they're not roaming
campus or in their hotels, the
players are busy shaping into
form for the World Cup. The
camp serves not only as away
for Klinsmann to select his
final 23-man squad, but more
importantly, to give the play
ers top-notch preparation for
the World Cup and the envi

ronment ahead in Brazil. The
location for the camp is al
ways strategically chosen in
an attempt to replicate the
weather that the team will
face at the World Cup, and of
course to provide top-notch
facilities for training.
"Logistically, we couldn't
be at a better place," Klins
mann said. "The climate
it's dry, it's fresh and we can
push the guys, and this is
what the campaign here at
Stanford is about: Push them
to their limits absolutely be
cause we have to build the
foundation for the World
Cup."

The team will continue to
train on campus until its
friendly against Azerbaijan at
Candlestick Park next Tues
day night. After that, the na
tional team will travel to New
Jersey for another pre-World
Cup match against Turkey on
June 1 and to Jacksonville for
a game against Nigeria on
June 7. These three matches
will provide the final tune-ups
before the first World Cup
match takes place on June 16
against Ghana in Recife,
Brazil.
