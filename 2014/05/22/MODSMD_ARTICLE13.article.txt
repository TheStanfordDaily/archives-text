# SINGLES SUCCESS FOR STANFORD
## 
### FIONA NOONAN STAFF WRITER 
After a disappointing end to
the team portion of the NCAA
Women's Tennis Championships,
No. 11 Stanford (20-3,8-2 Pac-12)
is coming back strong on the indi
vidual side after winning five of
its six singles matches on
Wednesday.
As the only team to qualify all
six members of its lineup for the
NCAA Individual Championships,
expectations were high for the
Cardinal going in and, as usual,
they did not disappoint.
No. 54-ranked junior Ellen
Tsay was the only Stanford player
to fall on Wednesday, losing in two
sets to Notre Dame's No. 39 Quinn
Gleason.
Aside from that, it was upsets
galore for a Stanford squad that
has continued to impress during
this postseason.
As per usual, freshmen No. 50
Taylor Davidson, No. 57 Caro
line Doyle and No. 21 Carol Zhao
came through for the team, each
against players ranked in the
mid-40s nationally. At this point,
such strength is no surprise

from the trio.
The always-solid No. 3 senior
Kristie Ahn also bounced back
from a heartbreaking loss to North
Carolina's No. 1 Jamie Loeb on
Monday. She cruised past a famil
ial- foe, Virginia's No. 53 Stephanie
Nauta, who freshman Carol Zhao
beat in the clinching match during
the team competition's quarterfi
nals.

The storyline of the day,
though, was No. 51-ranked sopho
more Krista Hardebeck. After los
ing her last three matches, Harde
beck showed some of her tire in
stunning UVA's No. 4-ranked
Julia Elbaba in straight sets, 6-2,
6-2. The win will be key for Hard
ebeck's confidence going into
subsequent rounds, and may
have been just what she needed
to start racking up wins again
after suffering from rough outing
after rough outing during the
team tournament.
The tournament continues
Thursday with the round of 32.


TRI NGUYEN/The Stanford Daily
Freshman Caroline Doyle (above) has been a rock in coach Lele Forood's
singles lineup this season, racking up a team-high 34 wins, including a
three-set victory on Wednesday that advanced her to the NCAA round of 32.

Although Tsay's season is
over, the other five are still
going strong, and key upsets
for three of the five will be
critical boosters going into
the next round. As we've seen
throughout the year, though,
rankings mean next to noth
ing when it comes to this
Stanford squad.

The ones to watch will be
the freshman trio, who keep
getting hotter and hotter as
the season rolls on. After
routing their opponents
today, Zhao and Davidson
should be keyed up going
into Thursday and beyond,
and Wednesday's three-set
victory for Doyle will be good
preparation for tough
matches to come. The three
freshmen have been incredi
ble all year composed,
fierce and, most of all, clutch
performers in times of need
and if today was any indi
cation, that trend should
continue.

Ahn, of course, will be
looking for her first NCAA
singles title to close out her
college career before turn
ing pro this summer. For
Hardebeck, the individual
tournament is a chance at re
demption after a less-than
satisfactory individual per
formance at Pac-12s.

On the doubles side, the
Cardinal have just one team,
the No. 10-ranked duo of
Ahn and Zhao, who have
been outstanding all season.
The pair is coming off of a
tough loss to UNC's No. 3-
ranked Hayley Carter and
Loeb, but the outlook is
bright for the pair after mak

ing it to the finals of the im
mensely competitive Pac-12
Doubles Tournament.
They face No. 21-ranked
Julia Fellerhoff and Rebecca
Shine of Louisville to start
the tournament. A victory
would mean meeting either a
Georgia duo or Miami pair in
the round of 16, and the soon
est they might see a Pac-12
foe would be the quarterfi
nals, against USC's Zoe
Scandalis and Giuliana
Olmos.
The freshman-senior pair
has clicked all season, and
should continue to work well
together in the coming days
in Athens, Georgia.
Overall, the Cardinal are
in a good position as they
enter the next phase of the
NCAAs. Expectations are
high, even after the depar
ture of two-time NCAA
champion Nicole Gibbs, and
behind Ahn's leadership and
the freshmen's consistent
performance, Stanford is well
positioned to make yet anoth
er long tournament run.
