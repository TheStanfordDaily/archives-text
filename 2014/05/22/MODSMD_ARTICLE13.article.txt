# SINGLES SUCCESS FOR STANFORD
## 
### FIONA NOONAN STAFF WRITER 
After a disappointing end to
the team portion of the NCAA
Women's Tennis Championships,
No. 11 Stanford (20-3,8-2 Pac-12)
is coming back strong on the indi
vidual side after winning five of
its six singles matches on
Wednesday.
As the only team to qualify all
six members of its lineup for the
NCAA Individual Championships,
expectations were high for the
Cardinal going in and, as usual,
they did not disappoint.
No. 54-ranked junior Ellen
Tsay was the only Stanford player
to fall on Wednesday, losing in two
sets to Notre Dame's No. 39 Quinn
Gleason.
Aside from that, it was upsets
galore for a Stanford squad that
has continued to impress during
this postseason.
As per usual, freshmen No. 50
Taylor Davidson, No. 57 Caro
line Doyle and No. 21 Carol Zhao
came through for the team, each
against players ranked in the
mid-40s nationally. At this point,
such strength is no surprise

from the trio.
The always-solid No. 3 senior
Kristie Ahn also bounced back
from a heartbreaking loss to North
Carolina's No. 1 Jamie Loeb on
Monday. She cruised past a famil
ial- foe, Virginia's No. 53 Stephanie
Nauta, who freshman Carol Zhao
beat in the clinching match during
the team competition's quarterfi
nals.

The storyline of the day,
though, was No. 51-ranked sopho
more Krista Hardebeck. After los
ing her last three matches, Harde
beck showed some of her tire in
stunning UVA's No. 4-ranked
Julia Elbaba in straight sets, 6-2,
6-2. The win will be key for Hard
ebeck's confidence going into
subsequent rounds, and may
have been just what she needed
to start racking up wins again
after suffering from rough outing
after rough outing during the
team tournament.
The tournament continues
Thursday with the round of 32.
