## Culturally shocked 
### Uttara Sivaram 
My first grade Thanksgiving
was as wonderfully stereo
typical as anyone could have
wanted. I sang a soulful, self-written
song about being a turkey to my en
tire class and forgot the lyrics mid
way, so I ran out of the classroom,
flapping the paper feathers taped to
my arm and tripped headfirst into the
shrubbery right outside the door. My
entire class hooted and hollered and
followed my lead 20 little turkeys
running wild around the small cam
pus. One of them came up to me and
helped me out of the bushes.
"Which kind of Indian are you?"
he asked. He had painted blue stripes
on his face and worn a feathered
headband.

"I dunno," I said, with a shrug. All
I knew was that I wasn't a very good
turkey, and that was really all
Thanksgiving was about.
Cultural sensitivity is a very
touchy topic on this campus â€”at
least, it's a lot more serious than it
was in Mrs. Dorado's first-grade
classroom. Indeed, I was reminded of
my own cultural uncertainty after
spotting a good number of badly face
painted white people at Bay to
Breakers. Which kind of Indian am I?
Perhaps the better question is, which
kind of Indian were they?
It's tough being an ethnic minori
ty here not necessarily because
we're treated differently, but because
we have to spend a good amount of
time deciding whether or not we
should be offended by the rampant
cultural faux pas that happen here
on campus. I'm blessed with an
even temper and a slower-than-av
erage reaction rate to jokes, so I'm
usually spared from having to con
front political incorrectness, but as
my mother says often, I'm (some
what) one-of-a-kind.
We're a sensitive bunch here at
Stanford, and that's a great thing.
We're touchy about our holidays, our
customs, our families, our interests
we get prickly about almost every
thing that we deem important. I my
self was terribly offended when a fel
low classmate spoke out against
PBS's riveting series, Antiques
Roadshow, citing it to be "strange,"
"antiquated" (I'm sure the pun was
unintentional) and "more boring than
playing Planet Earth on mute."
Agreed, my passion for PBS is not
comparable to our respective cultur
al ties, but I think the crux of this
problem similarly lies in our loss of

empathy, rather than our rise in sen
sitivity.
Either we're bristling at the guy
in a poncho and sombrero on Cinco de
Mayo or frantically Yik-Yakking
about our God-given right to get
hammered on a colorful holiday. In
the end, we're left with a campus
wide, cultural void that no one really
takes the time to fill. We're left cele
brating quietly, within our own resi
dences, our cultural groups, our fra
ternities and our sororities. Indeed,
the Greek scene is no exception to
this the infamous "Indian Wed
ding" was nixed just last year as an
inaccurate and insensitive use of a
serious Indian custom. Today, we're
so afraid to make and take offense
that we've stripped our entire cam
pus of the fruits of Stanford's consid
erable cultural diversity. It's quite a
shame.

We're no longer cute first graders
(indeed, my mom says I never really
was) who can equate cultural holi
days with fun classroom activities
and sugar cookies and get away with
it. We have to start putting in more
time and effort to understand our
friends and classmates on a deeper
level. We have to understand that St.
Patrick's Day celebrates the patron
saint of Ireland, that Rosh Hashanah
recognizes the Jewish New Year, that
we light candles during Diwali be
cause it signifies the victory of light
over darkness. We have to be mindful
of the Native American community
when we tape feathers onto our heads
for the latest progressive. We have to
be better.
But when we ostracize our peers
for those cultural faux pas that we
will all inevitably make, we destroy
any and all desire for cultural discov
ery. When we make culture into an in
group, out-group issue, we turn some
of the most beautiful cultural cus
toms into campus-wide protests. It's
a shame that we're afraid to celebrate
cultures that aren't our own for fear
of offending some corner of our cam
pus. And because we're so busy pick
eting and drinking and Yik-Yakking,
our campus is now in a hopeless state
of cultural paralysis.
It's not an easy fix, and I don't
have a quick solution. But if we all re
laxed our grips on what we believe to
be "correct" or "justified," we may
just end up with a campus that can
boast diversity beyond a list of stats
on a Stanford Admit Weekend
brochure. So grab a sari, grab a bindi,
grab a CTM and come celebrate on
the quad with me next Diwali. No
singing this time, I promise.
