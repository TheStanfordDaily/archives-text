# On Ike's, protest and privilege

~\~Y T&'re losing our sandwich
l/l / es!" the protestors shout-
V V ed out into the void.
"What was that?" the void shouted
back. "Sorry, I'm kind of busy right
now."
Last Friday, as I chewed on my
slightly dry under-cheesed Subway
sandwich outside of Tresidder, I heard
a crowd of people roar behind me. I
turned around and my heart swelled
when I saw a gathering of students,
eyes ablaze, speaking out with one
voice.
But then I listened more closely to
that voice, and realized that they were
protesting the closing of Ike's Place.
My heart sank. Those gathered were
decrying a vision of Stanford in which
cleverly named, mozzarella-stick-filled
sandwiches are ghosts of the past. As I
watched, I thought about everything
that voice 'wasn't saying, and I got
pretty bummed out.
Let me back up: I love Ike's. I think
that Ike's sandwiches are delicious and
I have appreciated their Ã¼biquity at
student group meetings. I also think
that campus restaurants operated by
Residential and Dining Enterprises
are bland and lack personality My ex
perience with R&DE sometimes
makes me feel that they care about
food quality the same way they care
about students protesting in White
Plaza they don't.
That's really the issue, the extent to
which an R&DE, which states as its
core belief that "students... are the
reason we're here," seriously consid
ers their feedback. In this case, previ
ous reporting has made it clear that to
R&DE, student opinion was second
ary to business concerns. There was a
questionable student survey, a secret
committee and some good old-fash
ioned bureaucracy. Further, ASSU
Senator Andrew Aude 'l6 has articu
lated significant ways in which R&DE
is generally inefficient and wasteful.
With that in mind, I agree that Stan
ford mostly overstepped in evicting
Ike's from campus, though as some

have pointed out, Ike's has tended to
be overpriced and inconvenient.
Really, this is a boring issue, so I'm
trying to figure out why it has inspired
such fervor among the student body I
think what it ultimately comes down to
is privilege. I don't mean privilege as
the benefit that comes from being a
particular race, gender, class or sexual
orientation, but rather simply as the
state of having something good.
In that sense, Stanford students
are awash with privilege. We are privi
leged to have access to academic re
sources such as massive libraries and
research giants. We are privileged to
live in a relatively crime-free area, and
to walk outside comfortably in varying
states of inebriation.
We are also privileged to have
R&DE providing us with food and
housing. Last weekend, I went to
Wilbur Dining and ate pho and garlic
breadsticks, then ice cream, then more
breadsticks. I hate FloMo Dining Indi
an food with all of my being, but that's
only because I've grown tired of it after
over fifty Sunday dinners. What we
getfrom R&DE may not be exception
al, but it is good. Of course, as students,
we hope that R&DE will strive for ex
cellence, but at what point does "good"
or even "just okay" wan-ant a protest?
Look at it this way: From an out
sider's perspective, the Save Ike's
movement is at best Mvolous, and at
worst, embarrassing. It looks like a
privileged group of students who en
joyed sandwiches, lost their sandwich
es and now want those sandwiches
back. It looks like a group of Stanford
students who are purposely ignoring a
troubling set of social ills and compli
cated questions, all in the name of
sandwiches.
I fear that I sound like someone
who is jaded and crotchety, but I'm re
ally just confused. The compulsion to
protest is not one that I usually share,
even for issues that I really care about.
Still, I admire and respect those who
are willing to shout to make their voic
es heard, and I know how effective
protests can be at starting conversa
tions that lead to progress.
When I wandered into the crowd
last Friday I wasn't sure what conver
sation these protestors were trying to
stail. "Ike's > R&DE," one sign read.
Another put "R&DE" inside of
a stop sign. Ike Shehadeh him
self was there, understandably
upset. But his business has
twelve other locations; he will
be okay. I left after a few min
utes, and the crowd thinned
some time after that, and we all
returned to the comfort of our
dorm rooms. We will be okay.
This issue is not worth our
time. The worst possible use of
the talents, passion and energy
of Stanford students is to my
opieafly focus on the annoy
ances we face on campus for the
four year's that we're here.
Stanford tends towards a cer
tain myopia, so the perspective
of an outsider ends up being of
vital importance, because only
through that lens can we look
beyond Campus Drive to the
problems that matter, both for
us andfor not-us. This is abattle
that the Ike's protestor's have
lost, mistakenly believing there
was a war in the first place.
