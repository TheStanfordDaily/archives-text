# OUTSIDE THE BUBBLE
## A
						people's choice 
### James Bradbury 
When Narendra Modi, whose
Bharatiya Janata Party was
the landslide winner of the
past month's parliamentary elections
in India, campaigned for an "India free
of" the incumbent Indian National
Congress, even he must have assumed
that to be an exaggeration. But voters
(and the country's winner-take-all
electoral system) obliged. The Con
gress Party, dominant for most of
India's post-independence history,
won fewer than ten percent of the seats
in the lower house not enough even
to serve in the constitutional role of of
ficial opposition.
This was, as is often argued, the
first Indian election in decades that can
reasonably be described as a referen
dum on an individual candidate, but it
was more than that. It was also an un
precedented rejection of ten years of
rule by a party—one long taken for
granted as the embodiment of mass
politics, the establishment and even
the idea of India that is now so dom
inated by one family that its likely next
step after the failure of its PM candi
date Rahul Gandhi, son of party presi
dent Sonia Gandhi, is to swap him out
for his sister.
Yet another characterization of the
parliamentary elections, less frequent
ly seen now than it was several months
ago, is that they were a grand choice
between development models, with
the Congress representing left-wing
economist Amartya Sen's vision of so
cial welfare-driven growth and Modi
the neoliberal prescriptions of Jagdish
Bhagwati, the architect of India's
1990s economic reforms.
But this too is incomplete, especial
ly in hindsight. India didn't vote the
Congress out because of then welfare
schemes: They voted the Congress out

because, time after time, welfare
schemes were all they offered. Prime
Minister Manmohan Singh the
very man who as finance minister
under Narasimha Rao had spearhead
ed the implementation of the Bhag
wati reforms —was an invisible (and
usually inaudible) leader whose deep
loyalty to the Gandhi family, for whom
a new welfare proposal was the solu
tion to eveiy problem of government,
consistently won out over his better
policy judgment.

The Indian left and there is a
vast political space to the left of the
Congress, with socialist and commu
nist parties of every stripe and affilia
tion holding power in several state gov
ernments— views the Congress's
"faux-socialism" with disdain. But
while it is certainly the case that the
most loudly trumpeted, and most ex
pensive, welfare policies tend to be
aimed more at voter blocs than social
needs, the Congress's critics from the
left are reeling due to an election in
which large numbers of poor and mid
dle class voters, both urban and rural,
shifted from longstanding Congress
loyalties to voting for an overtly con
servative party
The left and the Congress
will continue to view things differently,
but it was precisely the B JP's conser
vative development vision, even more
than the party's right-wing Hindu na
tionalism (which Modi consistently
downplayed on the campaign trail),
that drew so many Indians to vote BJP
this month. Modi is no Thatcher he
opposes liberalizing foreign access to
the Indian retail market, is thought to
have mixed feelings about privatiza
tion and plans a set of massive infra
structure projects as the centerpiece
of his economic platform but he has
shown India a credible economic alter
native in which business can play a con
structive role.

In the absence of an official political
opposition, the role of a check on the

Modi administration fails largely to
civil society and the press. And when
the left decries "Big Media" as being
dominated by the corporate interests
they claim brought Modi to power, and
the right argues equally passionately
for the existence of an uncritically pro-
Congress journalistic cabal, this check
can come only from the increasingly as
sertive third section that practices nei
ther Modi-worship nor Gandhi-apolo
gy

The magnitude of Modi's mandate
itself provides somewhat of a silver lin
ing for the 69 percent of Indians who
voted against him: Unlike Manmohan
Singh, he cannot blame coalition allies
or opposition intransigence for the gov
ernment's failures.

But five years is a long time, and
Modi may only become a more divisive
figure as he begins to pin down policy
choices that his campaign had deliber
ately left unspecified. Above all, he
must choose between adopting the pol
icy platform of the Rashtriya Swayam
sevak Sangh, the BJP-affiliated Hindu
paramilitary group to which he has
dedicated much of his life, and being
Prime Minister for all Indians.
It is too soon to tell if Narendra
Modi's victory this spring should be
seen as a triumph of democracy (His
most ardent detractors, unsurprising
ly, see instead a mirror of the elections
that brought European fascism to
power.) But it already explains why
democracy matters.
The modern Chinese state, for in
stance, argues that what differenti
ates it from western democracies is
simply a lack of "inefficient" and
"disorganized" rotations of power
