# OP-ED
## The
						pursuit of passion (part I) 
### Jason van der Merwe 
This is the. first installment of a two
part op-ed. The entire op-ed can be
found on the Daily website and the sec
ond part of the op-ed will also run in
print tomorrow.

The word "passion" is thrown
around without much thought.
Young people, especially Stan
ford students, are expected to have a
passion whatever that means
that clearly defines their motivations,
decision-making and ultimately, their
lives. Warren Buffet repeatedly tells
college students, "Find your passion
in life and never stop pursuing it. If
you haven't found it yet, don't stop
searching." Steve Jobs famously im
plored students during his 2005 Stan
ford Commencement address,
"You've got to find what you 10ve...
the only way to do great work is to
love what you do. If you haven't found
it yet, keep looking."
The narrative that we are told
for many of us beginning at an early
age is that passion is the only road
to happiness in our careers. Find a
passion and then find an occupa
tion that matches that passion. We li
onize the great iconoclasts of the
modern era who built empires by
pursuing their passions. If only we
can find our true passion, the narra
tive goes, then inevitably, happiness,
contentment and success will follow.
This is the American dream, we are
told. This is the pursuit of life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness.
On the surface, passion appeal's to
have a relatively simple definition:
something you want to do because it
brings you joy. Most often, the term

"passion" is found in phrases such as
"find your passion" or "do you have a
passion?" However, these are loaded
phrases that carry a variety of conno
tations and meanings. Throughout
this discourse, I will employ a work
ing definition of passion as an obses
sion, infatuation or ardent pursuit of
a certain interest, activity or goal.
In order to dig deeper, I posi
tioned myself in Starbucks, buying
random people drinks in exchange
for conversation. I began by asking
my new friends what they thought
passion was. The responses initially
focused on how a passion should
bring you immense joy an activity
that you want to engage in regardless
of pay. However, as the discourse be
tween us developed, the definition of
passion became muddier. One person
noted that he "feels passionately
about many things" but thought that
"feeling passionately" is different
from having a passion.
Additionally, when I asked my
conversation partners to describe
someone in their lives who had a pas
sion, they described a person whose
life was consumed by it. These people
were focused, determined and willing
to place their passion ahead of all
other commitments. So the question
remains: Is "passion" born out of
something more than just an emo
tional attachment to a favorite
hobby?
The word passion is derived from
the Latin stem "pati," which means
"to suffer or endure." If we look at the
decisions and patterns displayed by
those who we believe to have an ob
sessive pursuit, we can see a theme of
sacrifice and suffering as a result of
prioritizing that passion over every
thing else. It is clear, for example,
that Olympic athletes, or aspiring
Olympic athletes, make daily sacri
fices in order to reach their goal.

Their training, sleep schedules and
constant work ethic take priority
over social life, comfort food and
other hobbies. The amount of obses
sion and dedication a person gives to
wards an activity or goal is indicative
of how important it is to them.
One of the questions I asked some
friends regarding this topic was:
"What do you think my passion is?"
The friends that I knew through a
certain activity usually replied with
the title of that activity. Some said
that I was passionate about invest
ment or venture capital, because of
my work in those areas. Others an
swered "computer science" or "pho
tography." However, when I asked
the people who were closest to me,
the people I live with and the friends
I see regularly, they all tentatively
answered, "I don't know if you have a
passion."
I actually agree. But most people
I conversed with shared the same
conclusions about themselves after
introspection. There is an inherent
time component to developing a pas
sion; someone who starts to enjoy an
activity immensely for a week cannot
say they he or she has found the en
deavor that they want to pursue to no
bounds. True passion is put to the lit
mus test of time, which introduces a
myriad of challenges and hurdles.
Through these challenges, a per
son can prove that they have a pas
sion. Are you willing to make sacri
fices for your passions? Do you find
them changing regularly? What does
time say about your passions? See,
passion isn't just something you can
do in a state of flow. Rather, passion is
something that requires dedication,
perseverance and time-independ
ence.
