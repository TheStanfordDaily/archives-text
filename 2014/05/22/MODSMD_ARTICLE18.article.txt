# PUSH TO THE TOP
## Memorable season for volleyball despite NCAA title defeat 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's volleyball
team took a very unusual path to
wards a tremendously successful
season, starting and ending the
season ranked in the top five na
tionally and making it to the
MPSF and NCAA Championship
matches. The Cardinal (24-8,17-7)
ended the season No. 2 in the na
tion after a heartbreaking loss in
the NCAA finals against No. 1
Loyola-Chicago, narrowly missing
out on the program's third nation
al title.

But while Stanford ended the
season with the strength and con
fidence that only a national con
tender could have, things did not
always seem so bright for the
team. Despite being ranked in the
preseason top five, the Cardinal
struggled early in the season to
find a rhythm. The team seemed
lost on the road, lacking confi
dence and getting frustrated when
things weren't going their way.
They were unable to win five-set
ters, losing many close matches in
gut-wrenching fashion. Conse
quently, the team lost three road
matches in a row in the middle of
January and began their once
hopeful season with a rocky 6-7
start in MPSF play.
But in true Cardinal character,
Stanford showed maturity and re
silience from that point forward.
After returning to Maples with
that 6-7 conference record, Stan

ford regained some of its confi
dence with two impressive wins.
The team began to look unified,
and the seniors demonstrated
quality leadership by rallying the
unit and keeping their poise in
tough moments. Patience and a
steady offense quickly began to
define the team. Senior All-Amer
ican Brian Cook led the team in
kills 24 times this season, ending
his all-conference season with 461
kills and averaging 3.81 kills per
set.
Fellow senior All-American
Steven Irvin also had an impres
sive season, coming through with
critical plays and providing a sense
of calm on the court. All the seniors
were essential in keeping the team
together; their experience with
the program helped the team re
main true to the Stanford style of
playâ€”smart offense and tough
defense.

While the seniors provided the
leadership the team needed
throughout the season to get to the
NCAA finals, the younger mem
bers of the squad demonstrated in
credible growth and improvement
on the road to the championships.
Sophomore James Shaw con
trolled the offense throughout the
season, pushing the offense to a
.336 hitting average on the year.
Shaw was recently named to the
2014 U.S. Men's National Team for
the World League competition.
Once Stanford found its groove
as a team, the Cardinal seemed un
stoppable. John Kosty's group be
came the team to beat in March,
but seemingly couldn't find an an
swer to one team, the leaders of
the MPSF conference the BYU
Cougars. After losing to BYU both
at home and on the road earlier in
the season, Stanford had a tough

loss to the Cougars while playing
the MPSF Tournament Champi
onship match on BYU's home
court in Provo, Utah.
So when it came time to face
BYU again in the semifinals of the
NCAA Tournament, the two
teams had built up a strong rivalry
and both seemed equally eager to
best the other. In what was in
many ways its strongest show of
talent, and more importantly
teamwork and perseverance,
Stanford finally overcame BYU
and beat the Cougars in a nail-bit
ing five set match.
With the win, Stanford found
itself in familiar territory play
ing for the program's third nation
al title. Stanford faced No. 1 Loy
ola-Chicago, which had home
court advantage and only one loss
during the campaign. While Stan
ford played an impressive match
and pushed the match to five sets,
Loyola-Chicago used its home
court advantage to gain momen
tum and win a national champi
onship.
Overall, while the Cardinal's
season ended with a disappointing
loss, it was the journey to the
NCAA finals that truly mattered.
And the end result of that journey
was just as impressive as any na
tional title because of the way the
team overcame tremendous ad
versity, earning its No. 2 ranking
through teamwork, tough work
and patience. The Cardinal did not
give up and rallied around each
other and their coaches, with dif
ferent players stepping up
throughout the season. It was,
again, a season of true Stanford
volleyball.
