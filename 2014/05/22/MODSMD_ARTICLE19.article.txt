## Women's golf in seventh halfway through NCAA Championships 
### â€” Cameron Miller 
After 36 holes of play at
the Tulsa Country Club, the
Stanford women's golf squad
sits in seventh place in the 24-
team field. Anne Walker's
quintet markedly improved
on its Tuesday performance,
bettering its score by 14
strokes, from a 20-over 300 to
6-over 286 on Wednesday
a resurgence spurred by the
excellent play of sophomore
Mariah Staekhouse.

Stackhouse, who placed
T-29th in the individual
standings at last season's
championships, lagged a bit
in Tuesday's first frame,
bookending her round with
consecutive bogeys en route
to a 5-over 75. The Riverdale,
Georgia native turned things
around in a big way on the
second 18, stringing together
four straight birdies on holes
15-18 after starting her
round on the par-4, 416-yard
10th hole. She wasn't able to
maintain her momentum on
the back nine, however,
where two bogeys dropped
her score to a 1-under 69.
Still, her solid second round
lifted her into the top 20 and
only three shots out of the
top 10.
The real story for Stan
ford at the NCAA finals thus
far has been Stackhouse's
classmate, Lauren Kim. Ar
guably the Card's best play
er over the course of the
spring season, this event may
be the coming-out party Kim

needs to vault her into the
upper echelon of collegiate
golfers. Her round one 3-
under 67, which included
birdies on three of the four
par-3s, put her in a three-way
tie for first in the individual
standings. She fell back a
fraction in the second round
with a 1-over 71, but still
signed an incredibly steady
scorecard that showed 17
pars. After Wednesday, Kim
finds herself in a tie for sec
ond, and only three strokes
off the pace set by Okla
homa's Alexandra Kaui.
But despite the excellent
showings from their two
stars, the Cardinal are cur
rently in seventh place in the
team race, eleven shots be
hind first-place Oklahoma.
As has been an issue
throughout the season, Walk
er's unit has struggled with
its depth thus far in the
NCAA championships, and
has not found a consistent
scorer in the four slot.
Freshman Casey Daniel
son who has played ex
tremely well for Stanford dur
ing the spring portion of its
schedule showed her age in
round one, limping to a 9-over
79. Junior Mariko Thmangan
also carded a 79 on Tuesday,
with senior Marissa Mar turn
ing in an 82. Though those
three improved their num
bers in round two, the Card
are going to need a lot more
from the back end of their
lineup in the second half of the
tournament if they are to chal
lenge for a podium spot.
