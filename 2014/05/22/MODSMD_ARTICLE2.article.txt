The bells at Hoover Tower, usually reserved for occa
sions like the baccalaureate ceremony, will ring Thursday
for a carillon concert intended to foster reflective contem
plation among students, faculty and staff.
Starting at 11:30 a.m., there will be optional tai chi and
stretching exercises in Dohrmann Grove and the Oval Ear.
The carillon music is scheduled to begin at noon, followed
by designated time for contemplation.
Tia Rich 'B2 M.A. 'B5, one of the chief organizers of the
concert, says the event will provide a much-needed re
prieve for the busy members of the Stanford community.

not always in our sympathetic nervous system, always try
ing to generate new ideas and output," she said. "We have
to invite ourselves to go more into our parasympathetic
nervous system, where we rest and digest."
In particular, she emphasized the power of the "contem
plative pause," a key element in de-stressing and general
well-being. According to Rich, the contemplative pause
provides an opportunity to rejuvenate and separate posi
tive stress from negative stress.
