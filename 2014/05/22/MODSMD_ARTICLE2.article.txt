# STUDENT LIFE
## Carillon concert offers relaxation 
### VICTOR XU STAFF WRITER 
The bells at Hoover Tower, usually reserved for occa
sions like the baccalaureate ceremony, will ring Thursday
for a carillon concert intended to foster reflective contem
plation among students, faculty and staff.
Starting at 11:30 a.m., there will be optional tai chi and
stretching exercises in Dohrmann Grove and the Oval Ear.
The carillon music is scheduled to begin at noon, followed
by designated time for contemplation.
Tia Rich 'B2 M.A. 'B5, one of the chief organizers of the
concert, says the event will provide a much-needed re
prieve for the busy members of the Stanford community.
"On an individual basis we need to be careful that we're
not always in our sympathetic nervous system, always try
ing to generate new ideas and output," she said. "We have
to invite ourselves to go more into our parasympathetic
nervous system, where we rest and digest."
In particular, she emphasized the power of the "contem
plative pause," a key element in de-stressing and general
well-being. According to Rich, the contemplative pause
provides an opportunity to rejuvenate and separate posi
tive stress from negative stress.

This afternoon, the bells at Hoover Tower will ring for a
carillon concert, marking the beginning of the
weeklong "Contemplation by Design" program intended
to promote healthy habits through reflection.
"Contemplation by Design"
program, which was also
spearheaded by Rich. The
weeklong event was put to
gether in order to promote the
use of contemplative reflec
tion in de-stressing and
achieving a daily peace of
mind.
Among the sponsors are
the Office of Student Affairs
and the Office for Religious
Life, along with well-being-fo
cused organizations like I
Thrive, BeWell, the Health
Improvement Program
(HIP), Stanford Live, the
HELP Center and the Work-
Life Office.
Wes Alles, the director of
HII) says that Contemplation

by Design was to some degree
a reaction to the levels of
stress at Stanford. Alles no
ticed relatively high stress in
faculty and staff despite im
provements in other health in
dicators like physical fitness
and diet. As one way of ad
dressing this, HIP has collab
orated with BeWell, the over
arching health and well-being
network at Stanford, to help
the Stanford community rec
ognize the importance of daily
reflection and relaxation.
"If we give people enough
knowledge and skills, we can
help them get to a better
place, with less straggle in
their life," Alles said. "Strug
gle can be overbearing. Too
much struggle leads to a
change in body physiology
that the body was not intend
ed to deal with."
The program has also en
listed the help of the arts com

munity at Stanford to aid in its
goal of introspection.
Matthew Tiews, executive di
rector of arts programs at the
Stanford Arts Institute and
another key collaborator, em
phasized the complementary
power of the arts in fostering
self-reflection, citing the med
itative quality of paintings like
the "Windhover" series by the
late art professor Nathan
Oliveira.
"[The arts] are away into
certain kinds of mindfulness
and certain kinds of pres
ence," Tiews said. "I think
that can be an important com
ponent of contemplation. The
arts are certainly a very effec
tive way of thinldng different
ly about yourself, and being
with yourself and just a work
of art."
