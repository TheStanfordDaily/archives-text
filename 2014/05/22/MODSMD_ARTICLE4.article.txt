# COLLO spurs collaboration
## New student arts group promotes interdisciplinary work 
### MINNA XIAO DESK EDITOR 
COLLO, a new student aids organiz
ing body housed under the Institute for
Diversity in the Ails (IDA), received vol
untary student organization (VSO) stand
ing from Student Activities and Leader
ship (SAL) this spring. The group aims to
facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration
within the arts at Stanford.

Though newly approved, COLLO
which stands for "COLLOQuium on is
sues of diversity x COLLABoration in the
arts" has been quite a few years in the

making.
The group's push to become a YSO last
spring did not receive approval, since
SAL wanted the group to distinguish it
self from other arts organizations on cam
pus, particularly the Student Organizing
Committee for the Arts (SOCA). This
year, COLLO formalized its new vision,
which is focused on elevating student tal
ent, improving networking and fostering
collaboration.
"What we identified is that SOCA is
very powerful at putting on large-scale
events that benefit the arts community,
such as Party on the Edge and Art After
Dark," said Annie Phan 'l6, a co-director
for COLLO. "How we differentiated our
selves is that instead of being more fo
cused on events programming, in the long
run we want to be network-based."

"We really focus on collaboration,"
said co-director Luke deWilde 'l6. "Some
thing that distinguishes us from SOCA is
that we really want to create a student
network that fosters collaboration and re
ally supports student artists across all
mediums, not just give them a stage."
Tyler Brooks 'l4, the organization's
founder and co-director, said COLLO
began as an "immensely nebulous idea"
during the 2010-11 school year in re
sponse to student demands for more on
campus support and pre-professional
training for the arts.
The next year, COLLO functioned as
the "Jam Committee" within IDA. Brooks

and his fellow committee members fo
cused on putting together events known
as "town halls" and "jam sessions," which
COLLO continues to organize to this day.

Brooks described the town halls as
"sort of house meetings for the arts on
campus," where students can come to
gether to vent them frustrations, plug
their events and brainstorm ideas for
what the arts could be like on campus.
During jam sessions, which average from
five to 10 participants, students from dif
ferent disciplines of art working in various
mediums come together to improvise and
engage creating interdisciplinary work.
During the 2012-13 school year, the
Jam Committee evolved into the

COLLO spotlights feature new student
work and offer an opportunity for student
artists to perform and discuss their latest
creations.

This past winter, for example, a listen
ing party was held for twin rapper/pro
ducer duo Aidan and Charlie Geronimus
'l6 at IDA's Harmony House. The twins
performed their latest mixtape and dis
cussed the humanitarian efforts behind
the project, the proceeds of which will all
be donated to feeding the homeless in the
Bay Area.
COLLO also hosts workshops, which
function as "skill shares" led by Stanford

As part of COLLO Spotlights, twins Aidan and Charlie Geronimus '16, who form
a rapper/producer duo called Authentic and Charlie G, held a listening party and
performed songs from their latest mixtape for fellow students at Harmony House.
COLLO is currently spear
heading a student artists'
portal integrated with Stan
ford's domain, which it hopes
to have ready by the end of
next year.

"It's kind of like a combi
nation of Facebook,
Linkedln, Craigslist and
Stanford Who," said Brooks
of the new portal, which is
being called ASSAP (the As
sociated Stanford Student
Artists' Portal). "You can cre
ate a profile of any of the
work you do on campus,
where you work, what soft
ware and equipment you use
and samples of your best
work."

deWilde, a rapper and
producer himself, envisioned
how a feature like ASSAP
could facilitate collaboration
amongst Stanford artists.
"For example, if [dance
group] DVB wanted to work
with [a capella group] Raa
gapella to create a perform
ance piece," he said. "What
would they do and where
would they start? We want to
be an organization that can
work with getting these two
groups into the same room
and do design thinking for
such interdisciplinary per
formances."

With the group's newly
minted standing as a VSO
and access to ASSU fees for
the upcoming year, COLLO's
directors are excited to ex
pand recruitment and foster
more opportunities to allow
Stanford's creative culture to
thrive.

This June, COLLO plans
to put on a one-and-a-half
hour-long pilot program that
will feature TEDx-style pre
sentations, student perform
ances and a facilitated jam
session.

"There's a lot that can be
discovered about the Stan
ford arts community," deWil
de said. "Every artist is al
ready extremely talented on
campus. But it's very easy to
feel alone on campus as an
artist, and to know that you
have a big group of people be
hind you supporting you
would be a pretty special feel
ing. And that's what we're
trying to create."
