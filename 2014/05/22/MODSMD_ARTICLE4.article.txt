# COLLO spurs collaboration
## New student arts group promotes interdisciplinary work 
### MINNA XIAO DESK EDITOR 
COLLO, a new student aids organiz
ing body housed under the Institute for
Diversity in the Ails (IDA), received vol
untary student organization (VSO) stand
ing from Student Activities and Leader
ship (SAL) this spring. The group aims to
facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration
within the arts at Stanford.

Though newly approved, COLLO
which stands for "COLLOQuium on is
sues of diversity x COLLABoration in the
arts" has been quite a few years in the

making.
The group's push to become a YSO last
spring did not receive approval, since
SAL wanted the group to distinguish it
self from other arts organizations on cam
pus, particularly the Student Organizing
Committee for the Arts (SOCA). This
year, COLLO formalized its new vision,
which is focused on elevating student tal
ent, improving networking and fostering
collaboration.
"What we identified is that SOCA is
very powerful at putting on large-scale
events that benefit the arts community,
such as Party on the Edge and Art After
Dark," said Annie Phan 'l6, a co-director
for COLLO. "How we differentiated our
selves is that instead of being more fo
cused on events programming, in the long
run we want to be network-based."

"We really focus on collaboration,"
said co-director Luke deWilde 'l6. "Some
thing that distinguishes us from SOCA is
that we really want to create a student
network that fosters collaboration and re
ally supports student artists across all
mediums, not just give them a stage."
Tyler Brooks 'l4, the organization's
founder and co-director, said COLLO
began as an "immensely nebulous idea"
during the 2010-11 school year in re
sponse to student demands for more on
campus support and pre-professional
training for the arts.
The next year, COLLO functioned as
the "Jam Committee" within IDA. Brooks

and his fellow committee members fo
cused on putting together events known
as "town halls" and "jam sessions," which
COLLO continues to organize to this day.

Brooks described the town halls as
"sort of house meetings for the arts on
campus," where students can come to
gether to vent them frustrations, plug
their events and brainstorm ideas for
what the arts could be like on campus.
During jam sessions, which average from
five to 10 participants, students from dif
ferent disciplines of art working in various
mediums come together to improvise and
engage creating interdisciplinary work.
During the 2012-13 school year, the
Jam Committee evolved into the

COLLO spotlights feature new student
work and offer an opportunity for student
artists to perform and discuss their latest
creations.

This past winter, for example, a listen
ing party was held for twin rapper/pro
ducer duo Aidan and Charlie Geronimus
'l6 at IDA's Harmony House. The twins
performed their latest mixtape and dis
cussed the humanitarian efforts behind
the project, the proceeds of which will all
be donated to feeding the homeless in the
Bay Area.
COLLO also hosts workshops, which
function as "skill shares" led by Stanford
