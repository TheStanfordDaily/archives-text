## Nigeria crisis coverage sparks concern 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
In the light of the kidnapping of over
200 young women by militant group Boko
Haram from a school in northern Nigeria
in mid-April, the Stanford Students in
Support of the Nigerian People hosted an
informative event last week to address
the tragedy.
The event aimed to not only provide a
space for students to show support of the
Nigerian people, but to also bring the

Stanford community up to speed with
what has been happening in the region af
fected by Boko Haram. Apanel includ
ing Associate Professor of African Histo
ry Sean Hanretta, second-year graduate
student Nisrin Elamin and Musila
Munuve 'l7 introduced the history of
Nigeria as well as a the international cov
erage of the story.
The panelists encouraged students to
be careful about gauging the information
that the media was presenting, especially
social media campaigns like #bringback

ourgirls, which have been particularly
controversial.

"As a social media campaign begun by
Nigerians in Nigeria, [#bringbackour
girls] did indeed provide away to draw
the attention of many outside the country,
particularly in the United States, to the
tragedy," Hanretta said. "Yet it also
quickly became appropriated by U.S.
media figures for their own distinct pur
poses. This shows clearly some of the pos-
sible limits of this kind of ac
tivism."
Uchechukwuka Monu, a
Ph.D. student who helped or
ganize of the event, echoed
Hanretta's warning.
"The social media cam
paign #bringbackourgirls
has brought back awareness
and it has brought the inter
national community to their
feet," Monu said. "But at lot
of times I feel like we have to
be aware of what [the cam
paign] is asking of the gov
ernment and see what Niger
ian people want. When we
support a campaign like that,
we need to check what these
activists are doing on the
ground."
The debriefing was fol

lowed by stories from three
Nigerian students. Second
year MBA student Ope
Aladekomo, Kemi Lijadu 'l6,
and Muzzammil Shittu 'l7
discussed their personal per
spectives on the series of
events in their home country.
"Forme, I can just imagine
myself in that situation,"
Aladekomo said. "The young
women are probably people
just like me 10 years ago. I
was also in a secondary gov
ernment school, lived in a
dorm house like them... it's
depressing to hear about how
it happened and wonder why
[no one did] anything until in
ternational press picked it
up."
Students later held a quick
candle-lit vigil and photo cam
paign in solidarity of the
Nigerian people.
Ultimately, the student or
ganizers hope the Stanford
community grows more wary

of the international media cov
erage of recent events, and
that students take the oppor
tunity to become more knowl
edgeable about the crisis.
"We need to make sure we
harness the energy of the re
sponse to the kidnapping in
the best way possible," Shit
tu said. "We should make
sure that all of the girls are
returned to their families
and also work towards find
ing solutions to the myriad
mix of problems that the kid
napping brought to light.
People smuggling, women's
education and chronic inse
curity are long-established
facts in much of northern
Nigeria and the Sahel region
of West Africa in general. Ef
fort needs to be directed at
the long-term resolution of
these problems."
