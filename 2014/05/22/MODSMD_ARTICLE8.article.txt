## Professor invents wireless energy transfer method for medical chips 
### â€“ Peter Samuel Moon 
Assistant Professor Ada Poon of the Elec
trical Engineering department recently in
vented a safe method to transfer energy to
medical chips in the body.
The technology, which was reported in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sci
ences, wirelessly transfers power into the
body. As waves travel differently when they
come into contact with different materials,
Poon was able to blend the safety of near-field
waves with the reach of far-field waves.
Poon's interdisciplinary research team
embarked on the project with collaboration of
John Ho M.A. 'l2 and Alexander Yeh M.A. 'l3,
electrical engineering graduate students in
Poon's lab; Yuji Tanabe, a visiting scholar; and
Ramin Beygui, associate professor of cardio
thoracic surgery at Stanford University Med
ical Center. The group experimented with
new ways to control electromagnetic waves to
help make the wireless transfer of power into
the body safe.
"To make electroceuticals practical, devices
must be miniaturized, and ways must be
found to power them wirelessly, deep in the
brain, many centimeters from the surface,"
said William Newsome, the Harman Family
Provostial Professor and professor of neuro
biology at Stanford.

This breakthrough technology will poten
tially allow for safely powering implantable
micro devices in the future.
