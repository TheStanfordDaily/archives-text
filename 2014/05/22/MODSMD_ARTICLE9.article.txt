### â€“ Peter Samuel Moon 
Stanford archaeologist Laura Jones is one
of three Stanford faculty members to win the
Amy J. Blue Award. As director of heritage
services and special projects, Jones has been
celebrated as "a champion of all things Stan
ford" and for setting a high ethical benchmark
in the care of tribal remains.
Jones was recognized by President John
Hennessy in a ceremony on May 21, in the
courtyard of Lagunita Court.
The program staff of the Native American
Cultural Center wrote on behalf of its mem
bers that Jones has left a "deep and wide
spread footprint" at Stanford. Further, Jones
was not only an advocate of preserving an
cient archaeological sites, but also of con
structing buildings anew.
"We also have a goal our leadership as a
world-class university," Jones said. "To
achieve that goal, we want to build a new hos
pital, to build a new chemistry building or to
be better stewards of the creek. It's my role to
see that we respect important archaeological
and historic sites and that our stewardship of
those sites is rewarded when we get permits
for our construction projects."
