## Op-Ed The 						pursuit of passion (part II) 
### Jason van der Merwe 
This is the second part of a two-part
op-ed. The previous installment ran on
Thursday.

So far, I have been writing
under one major premise: that
everyone should have a pas
sion. As high school seniors, we had
to show that we were "passionate"
about certain topics topics that
we would pursue throughout the
rest of our lives in order to gain
merit in the eyes of Stanford
University. Now that we are here,
the overwhelming narrative is that
Stanford is the time and place to
pursue that passion that we
displayed, and if you made it here
without having a passion, Stanford
is the place to find one. One
student that I talked with put it sim
ply, "The narrative is a little too
strong everyone should have a
passion and if you don't, you've
failed."

This fixation on passion is evi
dent in the way we label our peers
in our dorms, especially in fresh
men year. We refer our peers as
"the Olympian," "the math ge
nius," "the startup guy." Those of
us who don't have a "thing" desper
ately try to find that x-factor. So we
join a myriad of clubs and activities,
overcommitting as a method of soul-

searching.
The problem with this narrative
is that there is an expectation that
our "passion" is our identity. It turns
this ardent pursuit into a necessity,
the controlling component of who
we are. But while a passion can
indeed be a part of our identity, it was
never meant to be the core of who

While a passion
can be part of our
identity, it was
never meant to be
the core of what
we are.

we are. After all, though we like to
think that passions are forever, they
come and go, change and morph.
Additionally, our very motiva
tion driving the pursuit of the
passion ebbs and flows. As Stanford
behavior design expert B.J. Fogg ex
plains, motivation is like a wave,
with high and low points. I have
several friends who are Olympic
athletes, and one of them pointed
out that some days she absolutely
loves her sport, and some days she
struggles to find the enjoyment she
so regularly experiences.
Sometimes these low points
extend from days into long periods
of life, but this shouldn't have any
effect on our core identity. Who we
are as a person the key experi
ences and decisions that shape us
as humans still remains, even as
our passions change. We can't find
our identity in something that
changes as rapidly as our interests,
goals and dreams.
Furthermore, for those of us
who don't have a passion, the narrative leaves
us asking, "So, who are we? Where do we fit
in?" Freshman year can be exceptionally
overwhelming as we attempt to find our spe
cial niche our identity so that we fit in.
The idea that everyone at Stanford has their
"thing" pushes us to pursue passion relent
lessly. But we forget that passion isn't a
necessity. Passion is a privilege. There are
some people in the world who are privileged
enough to have found out what they love and
have been given an opportunity to pursue it
to endless bounds, but for most humans,
these opportunities simply don't exist. Can
we really say, then, that everyone ought to
pursue their passion no matter what?
We are fortunate to be at Stanford,
where we have the opportunity to explore
various areas of interest. Maybe we'll discov
er our true passion while we are here, maybe
we won't. But it is critical that we remember
that passion is not a sine qua non it's okay
if our passion doesn't result in a career. It's
okay if we don't know what we want to study.
It's even okay if we never find a passion.
Stanford should be four years of excited
exploration and experimentation, not four
years of stress about not having a "thing."
Your identity is not your passion you are
so much more than that.

In response to Steve Jobs, I don't think
that you need to find what you love in order
to do great work. While doing what you love
is a romantic idea, it discredits great work
that is done outside of passion, which occurs
every second all around the world. You can
be successful and happy outside of doing
what you love. Instead of actively searching
for what you love and not being content until
you find it, enjoy what you are already doing
and try new things, not for the sake of finding
passion, but out of curiosity.
If you're fortunate enough, passion will
develop organically. Jobs and Wozniak found
their infatuation for developing and distribut
ing personal technology through tinkering
with computers when they were young.
Rather than distracting from technology, their
curiosity added to it. Jobs went to typography
classes at Reed out of interest. Later, his
typography knowledge proved instrumental
in the development of digital typefaces.
Typography wasn't Jobs' dream, but he
produced something great as a result. My
point is: Enjoy Stanford and the many oppor
tunities here without stressing about finding
your passion. As C.S. Lewis pointed out,
"Don't let your happiness depend on
something you may lose." The frenetic quest
for passion is making us unsatisfied and un
happy and it's time that we reimagine that
otherwise noble pursuit.
