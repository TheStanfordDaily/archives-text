## From Kardinal Kink, with love 
### Lily Zheng 
Dear Stanford,

T A 7^ en * checked my email
\l\l that Monday afternoon
V V and saw the message titled
"Kardinal Kink New Group
Approval," I froze and stared at my
screen as if it were a bomb and that
email was its timer.
"New Group Approval?"

No, that doesn't mean any
thing by itself, I reasoned. It proba
bly means "newgroup decision" or
something. I was too scared to
assume we had made it that Kar
dinal Kink was now an official stu
dent group and my staring
match with this message quickly
turned into an episode rivaling my
showdown with Stanford's admis
sion email.

With that in mind, when I final
ly opened the email and saw the
word "congratulations!" in bolded
font, I practically started sobbing at
my desk.
We did it.

Kardinal Kink's journey to VSO
status was a long one, and definitely
a loud one in the last few months.
For those involved in our communi
ty, kink was a thing we were contin
ually thinking and rethinking to
understand better the culture of
consent, body-positivity and trust
that we took part in but for Kar
dinal Kink to become official, we
had to get Stanford to understand
us. And at first, that requirement
towered over our heads.

Kardinal Kink began as a place
for kinky Stanford students to meet
each other in real life. It didn't have
a formal structure or strong advoca
cy goals but it was a haven for
those first few members. Kink
hadn't ever been an integral part of
the Stanford community, and hav
ing a safe space to meet, chat, and
talk about their lives without fear of
judgment or repercussions was in
credibly important for the first few

members of the young group.
But why did we have to meet in
secret? Why was this an under
ground group? Why couldn't we
have filed for VSO status in the very
beginning?

The truth of the matter is that
kink was (and still is) very much
misunderstood. The sensational
ized media representations of
dominatrices, naked politicians,
latex and leather BDSM porn,
essentially are the most accessi
ble representations of kink for most
people, and this is troublesome
because it leaves out the most im
portant parts of what makes kink
kink. People know the safewords
but not the negotiations that set
them up; people know the floggers
and whips but not the people who
they are used by and on; people
know the ropes and collars but not
the complicated interactions and
communication that goes on in
scene around bondage and every
thing else.
That is, people see kink as
actions and not as a community or a
culture and when your identity
is reduced to just a handful of
actions, it makes coming out even
harder. What does coming out
about kink even look like?

When your best friend tells you
"I'm gay," they're telling you a lot
more than who they want to have
sex with. (Shoutout to queer asexu
al people!) Most of the time "gay" is
just a specific way of talking about
love, attraction, desire —and it
has its own culture attached to it as
well, whether or not people want to
become involved with it. But when
your best friend tells you they're
kinky, that culture and community
don't immediately come to mind.
"You like to hit people?" or "I
don't understand why you needed
to tell me details of your personal
life," someone might say in disgust.
But in the same way that being gay

is about more than sex, kink is more
than kinky acts.

Kardinal Kink's mission state
ment defines kink as the following:
A community looking to
build on the historical cultures
of BDSM, Leather culture and
sex-positivity towards a modern
movement celebrating consent,
sexual and sensual freedom, and
the identities and communities
centered on these ideas. We de
fine kink as being broader than
just specific acts or identities, fo
cusing more on ways of under
standing cultures of consensual
intimacy unexplained by the pre
vailing narrative of "sex."
Kink is about consent about
trust.
But that idea wasn't too out
there, especially not to Stanford stu
dents who only knew kink through
media. Who knows what would
happen if they met an actually
kinky person, right?
There was a pretty big reason
for Kardinal Kink members to stay
anonymous —to not out them
selves. Public opinions on kink are
incredibly unaccepting, reflected in
the fact that fetishism, cross-dress
ing and BDSM were only just taken
out of the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders in
2013. Last year. On campus, there
were hardly any resources for stu
dents with questions about BDSM,
polyamory or so on, let alone a
community of peers. Coming out as
kinky on campus for many people
meant and still means shooting
their careers in the foot.

With all that in mind, Kardinal
Kink's group of students (not yet a
student group) continued quietly
for a few more quarters, gaining
50+, 60+ members through word
of mouth alone. Near the end of
winter quarter this year, we decided
that we wanted to be official.
Members were mobilized, the VSO appli
cation was completed almost overnight it
was like a movie training montage, but kinkier.
A month later, though, we were looking at the
email. "Consider reapplying," it said.
Spring quarter began and a good chunk of
our leadership left to study abroad or graduat
ed. We had a slew of suggestions to take into
account for revising our application, and we
made a lot of noise in return with an article in
Salon and on campus. There were a lot of
meetings.
Eventually, we came to the definition of
kink mentioned previously. We fleshed out a
leadership structure for our group, got the
help of an amazing faculty club advisor and
made ourselves a little better-known on

campus. When we submitted the application,
I honestly felt like the campus had become a
more accepting place for kink than it had been
earlier in the year.
A few weeks ago we reapplied, and a few
days ago, we got our answer.
Of course, as a new student group we
have a lot to do and we definitely won't say
that we've massively changed the perception
of kink on campus after just a few quarters.
But the outpouring of support from Stanford
students and faculty has been amazing to see,
and the enthusiasm more than we could ever
have predicted.
Kardinal Kink is official, and it's thanks to
the continuing support and enthusiasm of the
Stanford community. Thank you!

Love,
Kardinal Kink

there, especially not to Stanford stu
dents who only knew kink through
media. Who knows what would
happen if they met an actually
kinky person, right?
There was a pretty big reason
for Kardinal Kink members to stay
anonymous —to not out them
selves. Public opinions on kink are
incredibly unaccepting, reflected in
the fact that fetishism, cross-dress
ing and BDSM were only just taken
out of the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders in
2013. Last year. On campus, there
were hardly any resources for stu
dents with questions about BDSM,
polyamory or so on, let alone a
community of peers. Coming out as
kinky on campus for many people
meant and still means shooting
their careers in the foot.

With all that in mind, Kardinal
Kink's group of students (not yet a
student group) continued quietly
for a few more quarters, gaining
50+, 60+ members through word
of mouth alone. Near the end of
winter quarter this year, we decided
that we wanted to be official.
Members were mobilized, the VSO appli
cation was completed almost overnight it
was like a movie training montage, but kinkier.
A month later, though, we were looking at the
email. "Consider reapplying," it said.
Spring quarter began and a good chunk of
our leadership left to study abroad or graduat
ed. We had a slew of suggestions to take into
account for revising our application, and we
made a lot of noise in return with an article in
Salon and on campus. There were a lot of
meetings.
Eventually, we came to the definition of
kink mentioned previously. We fleshed out a
leadership structure for our group, got the
help of an amazing faculty club advisor and
made ourselves a little better-known on

campus. When we submitted the application,
I honestly felt like the campus had become a
more accepting place for kink than it had been
earlier in the year.
A few weeks ago we reapplied, and a few
days ago, we got our answer.
Of course, as a new student group we
have a lot to do and we definitely won't say
that we've massively changed the perception
of kink on campus after just a few quarters.
But the outpouring of support from Stanford
students and faculty has been amazing to see,
and the enthusiasm more than we could ever
have predicted.
Kardinal Kink is official, and it's thanks to
the continuing support and enthusiasm of the
Stanford community. Thank you!

Love,
Kardinal Kink

Dear Stanford,

T A 7^ en * checked my email
\l\l that Monday afternoon
V V and saw the message titled
"Kardinal Kink New Group
Approval," I froze and stared at my
screen as if it were a bomb and that
email was its timer.
"New Group Approval?"

No, that doesn't mean any
thing by itself, I reasoned. It proba
bly means "newgroup decision" or
something. I was too scared to
assume we had made it that Kar
dinal Kink was now an official stu
dent group and my staring
match with this message quickly
turned into an episode rivaling my
showdown with Stanford's admis
sion email.

With that in mind, when I final
ly opened the email and saw the
word "congratulations!" in bolded
font, I practically started sobbing at
my desk.
We did it.

Kardinal Kink's journey to VSO
status was a long one, and definitely
a loud one in the last few months.
For those involved in our communi
ty, kink was a thing we were contin
ually thinking and rethinking to
understand better the culture of
consent, body-positivity and trust
that we took part in but for Kar
dinal Kink to become official, we
had to get Stanford to understand
us. And at first, that requirement
towered over our heads.

Kardinal Kink began as a place
for kinky Stanford students to meet
each other in real life. It didn't have
a formal structure or strong advoca
cy goals but it was a haven for
those first few members. Kink
hadn't ever been an integral part of
the Stanford community, and hav
ing a safe space to meet, chat, and
talk about their lives without fear of
judgment or repercussions was in
credibly important for the first few

members of the young group.
But why did we have to meet in
secret? Why was this an under
ground group? Why couldn't we
have filed for VSO status in the very
beginning?

The truth of the matter is that
kink was (and still is) very much
misunderstood. The sensational
ized media representations of
dominatrices, naked politicians,
latex and leather BDSM porn,
essentially are the most accessi
ble representations of kink for most
people, and this is troublesome
because it leaves out the most im
portant parts of what makes kink
kink. People know the safewords
but not the negotiations that set
them up; people know the floggers
and whips but not the people who
they are used by and on; people
know the ropes and collars but not
the complicated interactions and
communication that goes on in
scene around bondage and every
thing else.
That is, people see kink as
actions and not as a community or a
culture and when your identity
is reduced to just a handful of
actions, it makes coming out even
harder. What does coming out
about kink even look like?

When your best friend tells you
"I'm gay," they're telling you a lot
more than who they want to have
sex with. (Shoutout to queer asexu
al people!) Most of the time "gay" is
just a specific way of talking about
love, attraction, desire —and it
has its own culture attached to it as
well, whether or not people want to
become involved with it. But when
your best friend tells you they're
kinky, that culture and community
don't immediately come to mind.
"You like to hit people?" or "I
don't understand why you needed
to tell me details of your personal
life," someone might say in disgust.
But in the same way that being gay

is about more than sex, kink is more
than kinky acts.

Kardinal Kink's mission state
ment defines kink as the following:
A community looking to
build on the historical cultures
of BDSM, Leather culture and
sex-positivity towards a modern
movement celebrating consent,
sexual and sensual freedom, and
the identities and communities
centered on these ideas. We de
fine kink as being broader than
just specific acts or identities, fo
cusing more on ways of under
standing cultures of consensual
intimacy unexplained by the pre
vailing narrative of "sex."
Kink is about consent about
trust.
But that idea wasn't too out
there, especially not to Stanford stu
dents who only knew kink through
media. Who knows what would
happen if they met an actually
