## HEAD TRAUMA THE 						STEEP PRICE OF CONCUSSIONS 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
"I remember thinking I was feeling fine and I played the
rest of the game ... we did the concussion tests and every
thing seemed okay. Then I woke up the next morning and
everything was super foggy and I couldn't really think straight.
I could barely get out of bed. I just didn't know what was hap
pening."
It was a scary situation for then-freshman women's bas
ketball player Toni Kokenis, who had hit the back of her head
on the camera of a photographer during a game against UCLA
after getting fouled hard on a layup attempt. Not only was the
injury not readily apparent, but it also escaped immediate di
agnosis, which likely magnified its effect after Kokenis had
been allowed to re-enter the game.
The topic of concussions has come to the forefront of the
athletic world within the last several years, at least in part due
to increasing awareness toward injuries like Kokenis', as well
as the emergence of long-term health detriments due to the
improper handling of concussions and other traumatic brain
injuries (TBIs).
Even though deterrent measures, like the newly estab
lished NCAA football targeting penalty a 15-yard punish
ment for hits on defenseless players, particularly on the head
or neck area have been established to mitigate the effects
of concussions, the nature of the injuries themselves and pos
sible courses of action still largely remain a mystery.
Even as research tries to find answers to this mystery, the
issue of concussions in sports remains very real, with lasting
and significant effects on the athletes that suffer from them.
Luckily for players like Kokenis, new research conducted at
Stanford might bring the sports world closer to a better under
standing of how to mitigate the effects of concussions.

Theo Roth' 14 already knows that he wants to spend his
life doing research. Even though he has juggled several other

activities, such as playing the tenor saxophone in the Band,
he maintained research as a focal point of his Stanford edu
cation and his academic career. Roth first started conducting
research during the summer after his senior year of high
school at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Although he participated in several projects when he
first started, Roth began to work in neurosurgery as part of a
project that enabled him to take live images of the outer lay
ers of mice's brains. Because he was learning a surgery that
required specialized techniques that often took years to de
velop, Roth found himself making mistakes with the delicate
techniques.
Even when he made mistakes that accidentally caused
damage to the brains, however, he would still scan and take
images of them. This led to an interesting discovery: The
damaged cells didn't die, but instead reacted more actively
than expected.
Roth then collaborated with an MRI imagery expert to
find interesting broader similarities in brain damage between
human patients suffering from mild traumatic brain injuries
and the damage to the mice brains in his experiments.

Theo Roth '14 (above) has conducted research with the National
Institutes of Health that could potentially have important
ramifications for knowledge about tramautic brain injuries.
"That gave us hope that what
we were doing in mice is actually
biologically relevant to what hap
pens in a brain during mild trau
matic brain injury," Roth said.
The discovery led to further
exploration of the various types of
cells involved in the brain injuries
of mice, as well as these cells' func
tions; in turn, the researchers un
covered the first stages of a possi
ble therapeutic element that could
potentially mitigate brain cell dam
age. And while Roth's research rep
resented progress, a significant
hurdle still remained the deliv
ery of the drug to the brain.
"It's very difficult to get any
thing to the brain at the site of in
jury," Roth said. "And so there's
lots of drugs that have been previ
ously identified including the
one that we used as being pro
tective in traumatic brain injury,
but that's only effective if you gave
it before the injury or injected it
straight into where the injury hap
pened."

Essentially, this meant that on
going research allowed for the de
velopment of a therapeutic re
sponse that could act similarly to a
vaccine with a more preventative
element, but would not have much
use if a quick response was need
ed.

Even with the headway made
on the issue of response to TBIs, an
equally significant question lies on
the other side of the problem that
Roth's research: How to diagnose
and characterize a concussion.

The concussion that Kokenis
suffered against UCLA was neither
her first nor her last. Of the four
concussions that she endured, the
first occurred in her junior year of
high school, while the other three
at Stanford occurred in her fresh
man, sophomore and junior years,
respectively.

For all three concussions that
she suffered while at Stanford, Ko
kenis found herself confused and
dissatisfied with the protocol that
existed within the athletics depart
ment in dealing with her injuries.

Due to the long-term impact that
concussions can have Kokenis
suffered from after-effects for
months after each concussion

she was unable to simply "wait
out" the injury and recover proper
ly according to the athletic depart
ment's procedure. Instead, Koke
nis had to keep up with the work
and the other elements of her Stan

ford experience despite still deal
ing with the after-effects of her
concussion.

"I missed one midterm for a
class, and I had the next one com
ing up the next week, and I missed
that," Kokenis said of her third con
cussion. "So I had this struggle of
trying to get back into work so I
didn't fall super far behind, so it

wasn't like I could just not do any
thing and be totally fine. You have
to try to find away to keep up with
everything."

As a result of her continual ef
forts to close out the school year,
Kokenis wasn't able to use the
respite from basketball to recover.
Later, when the summer came
around and workouts began once
again, Kokenis started the "return
to-play protocol" to try and get
back into basketball but found her
self continuing to struggle with the
injury.

"That was just a long sum
mer," Kokenis said. "I would just do
a little bit, and then I would feel
horrible, and then I couldn't
progress and would have to take a
day off because I would have symp
toms. And then I'd go back to it. I
was doing a lot better when I got
back to school, but I wasn't at the
same level as my teammates.
"It's like, 'Why can't you [do
the conditioning tests]? You should
be able to do them by now.' So it
was really hard trying to find a bal
ance ... what is too much? Since
nobody knows anything."
The reason why Kokenis found
herself so unclear and confused
about her ultimate road to recov
ery was because of the loose, rela
tively unstructured protocol that
the athletic department instituted
for concussions. While the depart
ment offered her general guide
lines with regards to the various
"steps" in the process, the guide
lines often left her with more ques
tions than answers.

The protocol involved activi
ties at different stages of rigor, like
a light bike ride, an intense bike
ride, a weightlifting session and a
run; Kokenis would need to "step
up" the activity based on whether
she was asymptomatic for the 24
hours following each step.
But what if she was not feeling
well at a certain stage for an ex
tended period of time? Should she
stay at the same step? Should she
take a step back? Should she take a
break for a while and start over?
There were many questions, and

few answers. This was not neces
sarily the fault of the athletic de
partment; the uncharacterized na
ture of concussions and traumatic
brain injuries has not allowed for
the development of a definitive
protocol yet.
"It's so up in the air," Kokenis
said. "And that's what's frustrating.
I wouldn't blame the athletic de
partment for not knowing this; it's
so individual. What I may be able to
do at stage one and be totally fine
could be too much for somebody
else to do. So how do you decide
what is the right amount to do?
"It was frustrating as an ath
lete not really having a structure to
go by," she continued. "Which was
frustrating but at a time nice, be
cause when I was home, my work
outs were in my own hands and I
could more so go on how I was feel
ing."

Over the summer, as she re
covered at home, Kokenis benefit
ed strongly from being able to in
tersperse her workouts between
naps, which allowed her to recover
at her own pace. However, when
she returned to campus for team
workouts, the more rigid structure
of longer practices resulted in her
condition deteriorating, leaving
Kokenis not feeling like herself. As
such, she entered her junior sea
son at a lower level than the rest of
her teammates.

Then, the straw that broke the
camel's back came during a Feb. 3,
2013 matchup against Oregon
State, when she hit her head again
while boxing out. At that point,
after all she had been through

all of the uncertainties and hard
ships she knew it was over.
"Once I got my fourth, it was
not worth it," she said. "I hadn't
felt like myself for a year, basically.
It wasn't worth going through for
anything."
