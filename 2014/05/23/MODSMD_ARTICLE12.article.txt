## HEAD TRAUMA THE
						STEEP PRICE OF CONCUSSIONS 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
"I remember thinking I was feeling fine and I played the
rest of the game ... we did the concussion tests and every
thing seemed okay. Then I woke up the next morning and
everything was super foggy and I couldn't really think straight.
I could barely get out of bed. I just didn't know what was hap
pening."
It was a scary situation for then-freshman women's bas
ketball player Toni Kokenis, who had hit the back of her head
on the camera of a photographer during a game against UCLA
after getting fouled hard on a layup attempt. Not only was the
injury not readily apparent, but it also escaped immediate di
agnosis, which likely magnified its effect after Kokenis had
been allowed to re-enter the game.
The topic of concussions has come to the forefront of the
athletic world within the last several years, at least in part due
to increasing awareness toward injuries like Kokenis', as well
as the emergence of long-term health detriments due to the
improper handling of concussions and other traumatic brain
injuries (TBIs).
Even though deterrent measures, like the newly estab
lished NCAA football targeting penalty a 15-yard punish
ment for hits on defenseless players, particularly on the head
or neck area have been established to mitigate the effects
of concussions, the nature of the injuries themselves and pos
sible courses of action still largely remain a mystery.
Even as research tries to find answers to this mystery, the
issue of concussions in sports remains very real, with lasting
and significant effects on the athletes that suffer from them.
Luckily for players like Kokenis, new research conducted at
Stanford might bring the sports world closer to a better under
standing of how to mitigate the effects of concussions.

Theo Roth' 14 already knows that he wants to spend his
life doing research. Even though he has juggled several other

activities, such as playing the tenor saxophone in the Band,
he maintained research as a focal point of his Stanford edu
cation and his academic career. Roth first started conducting
research during the summer after his senior year of high
school at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Although he participated in several projects when he
first started, Roth began to work in neurosurgery as part of a
project that enabled him to take live images of the outer lay
ers of mice's brains. Because he was learning a surgery that
required specialized techniques that often took years to de
velop, Roth found himself making mistakes with the delicate
techniques.
Even when he made mistakes that accidentally caused
damage to the brains, however, he would still scan and take
images of them. This led to an interesting discovery: The
damaged cells didn't die, but instead reacted more actively
than expected.
Roth then collaborated with an MRI imagery expert to
find interesting broader similarities in brain damage between
human patients suffering from mild traumatic brain injuries
and the damage to the mice brains in his experiments.

was frustrated by the lack of knowledge regarding traumatic brain injuries knowledge that could have saved her career.
