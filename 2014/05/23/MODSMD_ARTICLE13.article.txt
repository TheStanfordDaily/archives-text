## Cardinal cling to NCAA hopes, seek sweep 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN DESK EDITOR 
A marathon regular season for Stanford
baseball suddenly comes down to a final
sprint with three all-important games in Salt
Lake City this weekend. Fittingly, "The
Crossroads of the West" will provide the
backdrop for a Cardinal squad entering the
most crucial moment of its season the
Card are likely sitting on the outside looking
in for a spot in the NCAA Regionals, but
they still have a fighting chance of making a
move into the field of 64.

To avoid postseason doom, Stanford
(27-23, 13-14 Pac-12) will almost certainly
have to bring out the brooms and sweep the
University of Utah (16-33, 4-23), the last

place team in the conference; at this point,
taking two of three games will likely not cut
it. Though the odds are stacked against the
Card, there is still a good deal of confidence
in the Stanford dugout.

"If we can take care of business and
win the remaining games in Utah, I think
we give ourselves a chance, " said senior
Brett Michael Doran. "I don't really know
how the numbers work, but I know we're a
good enough team to make a run in the play
offs and I sure hope we get there."
In the latter part of the season, Stan
ford has gained a lot of ground, thanks to a
considerably easier second-half schedule.
After opening the season with tough non
conference matchups including No. 17
Rice and No. 10 Vanderbilt and jumping
into conference play with series against
Oregon State and Washington, Stanford ini
tially plummeted in the standings.
While the rough start to the season has
led to a pressure-packed final month of the

season, Stanford coach Mark Marquess
noted that the difficult schedule could give
his squad a boost over other teams on the
bubble.

"All I do know is that our RPI is a lot bet
ter than it was last year, even though our
record isn't because of the people we have
played," Marquess said. "We can speculate
and whatever. We're in better shape than
we were last year, I know that."
Last weekend, the Cardinal managed
to keep their postseason dreams howev
er unlikely alive after taking two out of
three games against Washington State. In
turn, the Card followed up the series win
with a victory over Pacific on Monday. Nev
ertheless, time has nearly run out for Stan
ford to rack up more wins. Fortunately for
the Card, they will have an excellent oppor
tunity to pick up victories against the strug
gling Utes, who have been swept by five

Sophomore left-handed pitcher Logan James (above), a late-season addition to the pitching rotation, will likely take the mound in Sunday's
regular season finale against Utah as the Cardinal look to sweep the last-place Utes and preserve their NCAA postseason aspirations.
Pac-12 opponents this season.
The Utes lack firepower in
their lineup slugging only .305
as a team but they have strug
gled even more with their pitching.
The Utes' projected starters for Fri
day, Saturday and Sunday jun
ior Mitch Watrous (3-6), senior
Zach Adams (0-6) and sophomore
Dalton Carroll (1-4), respectively

have a combined record of 4-
16, with ERAs all above 3.50.
The game plan for Stanford
should be simple, namely to jump
on Utah's pitchers early while neu
tralizing the Utes' bats particu
larly those of seniors T.J. Bennett
and Konnor Armijo. In a high-stakes
series, the Card will look to start
strong in each game in order to re
duce some of the postseason pres
sure hanging over them.
For Stanford, expect to see the
same starting rotation as last week,
with freshman right-hander Cal
Quantrill (4-5), junior lefty John
Hochstatter (9-1) and sophomore
lefty Logan James (2-3) all set to
close out the Card's regular season.
Stanford's pitching which has
seen numerous ups and downs
over the course of the season

has really hit its stride in the final
month of the regular season, as
Quantrill and Hochstatter have
both served as stabilizing forces for
the rotation.

On offense, junior center
fielder Austin Slater will look to
lead the way by putting runs on the
board for Stanford. Slater is in the
midst of his best stretch of the sea
son, taking a 14-game hit streak
into Salt Lake City and a .481 bat
ting average over the course of
those 14 games.
Stanford's final regular season
series begins Friday at 11 a.m. at
Smith's Ballpark. Saturday and
Sunday's games will also begin at
11 a.m.

After Sunday's game, Stanford
will not have to wait long to learn
its postseason fate. The field of 64,
and the NCAA Regional hosts, will
be announced at 9 a.m. on Monday.
