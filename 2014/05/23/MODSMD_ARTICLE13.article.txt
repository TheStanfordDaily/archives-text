## Cardinal cling to NCAA hopes, seek sweep 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN DESK EDITOR 
A marathon regular season for Stanford
baseball suddenly comes down to a final
sprint with three all-important games in Salt
Lake City this weekend. Fittingly, "The
Crossroads of the West" will provide the
backdrop for a Cardinal squad entering the
most crucial moment of its season the
Card are likely sitting on the outside looking
in for a spot in the NCAA Regionals, but
they still have a fighting chance of making a
move into the field of 64.

To avoid postseason doom, Stanford
(27-23, 13-14 Pac-12) will almost certainly
have to bring out the brooms and sweep the
University of Utah (16-33, 4-23), the last

place team in the conference; at this point,
taking two of three games will likely not cut
it. Though the odds are stacked against the
Card, there is still a good deal of confidence
in the Stanford dugout.

"If we can take care of business and
win the remaining games in Utah, I think
we give ourselves a chance, " said senior
Brett Michael Doran. "I don't really know
how the numbers work, but I know we're a
good enough team to make a run in the play
offs and I sure hope we get there."
In the latter part of the season, Stan
ford has gained a lot of ground, thanks to a
considerably easier second-half schedule.
After opening the season with tough non
conference matchups including No. 17
Rice and No. 10 Vanderbilt and jumping
into conference play with series against
Oregon State and Washington, Stanford ini
tially plummeted in the standings.
While the rough start to the season has
led to a pressure-packed final month of the

season, Stanford coach Mark Marquess
noted that the difficult schedule could give
his squad a boost over other teams on the
bubble.

"All I do know is that our RPI is a lot bet
ter than it was last year, even though our
record isn't because of the people we have
played," Marquess said. "We can speculate
and whatever. We're in better shape than
we were last year, I know that."
Last weekend, the Cardinal managed
to keep their postseason dreams howev
er unlikely alive after taking two out of
three games against Washington State. In
turn, the Card followed up the series win
with a victory over Pacific on Monday. Nev
ertheless, time has nearly run out for Stan
ford to rack up more wins. Fortunately for
the Card, they will have an excellent oppor
tunity to pick up victories against the strug
gling Utes, who have been swept by five

regular season finale against Utah as the Cardinal look to sweep the last-place Utes and preserve their NCAA postseason aspirations.
