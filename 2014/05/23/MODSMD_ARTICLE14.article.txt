There are few locales in the U.S. that can
stake a claim to "Golf Capital of America." Augus

men's golf team also will hit the American prairie
lands for the biggest prize of them all: an NCAA
championship. Prairie Dunes Country Club
aptly named in Hutchinson, Kansas, will host
the collegiate finals, which will start today and
conclude next Wednesday.

"We talk about those guys a lot, but I think
the keys for our success this whole year have been
our younger guys on the roster," Ray said. "We've
had some great depth, and Viraat Badhwar snuck
in a nice top-15 finish at regionals and just played
solid. David Boote played solidly as well and Mav
erick had a little bit of an off-week, but I thinkhe'll
be ready to go here at nationals. We're excited
about relying on those guys to pitch in a good
