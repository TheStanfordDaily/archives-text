## Taking aim at 9th title 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
There are few locales in the U.S. that can
stake a claim to "Golf Capital of America." Augus
ta, Georgia certainly has history and tradition on
its side with The Masters, while Pinehurst, North
Carolina, fashions itself as "The Cradle of Ameri
can Golf." Oakmont Country Club outside of
Pittsburgh has hosted a record eight U.S. Opens,
and the positions of Olympic Club and Pebble
Beach in California cannot easily be glossed over.
This week, however, the Midwest will capture
the attention of the American golf consciousness
an occasion that does not occur with great fre
quency, and one that will likely not be eclipsed for
some time.

That is because, like their female counter
parts currently in action in Tulsa, the Stanford
men's golf team also will hit the American prairie
lands for the biggest prize of them all: an NCAA
championship. Prairie Dunes Country Club
aptly named in Hutchinson, Kansas, will host
the collegiate finals, which will start today and
conclude next Wednesday.

The Cardinal enter the event as the nation's
third-seeded squad behind Oklahoma State and
defending national champion Alabama while
sporting two of the best amateur golfers in the
world in their lineup: junior Patrick Rodgers and
senior Cameron Wilson. Head coach Conrad Ray
knows the type of production he will get out of his
well-known front-runners, so he believes that it is
the back end of his lineup that will need to do
some heavy lifting over the next several days.
"We talk about those guys a lot, but I think
the keys for our success this whole year have been
our younger guys on the roster," Ray said. "We've
had some great depth, and Viraat Badhwar snuck
in a nice top-15 finish at regionals and just played
solid. David Boote played solidly as well and Mav
erick had a little bit of an off-week, but I thinkhe'll
be ready to go here at nationals. We're excited
about relying on those guys to pitch in a good
score and contribute to the team, and just make
a lot of pars—which is what they're good at."
"In my opinion, the best 1-2 punch in col
lege golf right now is Patrick Rodgers and
Cameron Wilson," added college golf analyst
Steve Burkowski on a media conference call
Wednesday. "Very solid team, and Patrick
Rodgers is on a mission. I'm telling you, he's
going to try to put the team on his back and ride
them to a national championship.
"That being said, when you get to match
play, you need others to step up. And my slight
est of concerns is that if you're good with Patrick
and Cameron, what are you going to get from
the guys in the 4-5 holes? They're going to need

a little something special down in the 4-5 spots
to win it all come next Wednesday."
The task of shoring up Stanford's team
score will be on the clubs of sophomore Boote,
freshman McNealy and freshman Badhwar.
Boote has been a fixture in Ray's lineup for much
of the past two campaigns, recording three top
-25 individual finishes in his past three tourna
ments. These impressive results, combined
with his experience, make him the likely candi
date to follow-up Rodgers and Wilson in the No.
3 scoring position.
McNealy also figures to be either the unit's
third or fourth scorer; the local Portola Valley
product has had an excellent spring, with three

top-10 finshes in four tournaments, dating back
to The Goodwin. His classmate Badhwar is com
ing off an impressive showing at regionals, and
the Card hope that he can maintain his momen
tum at his first NCAA finals.

An obstacle facing the Card in Kansas is the
howling winds that are common in the region,
as well as the links-style course that they will
face in Prairie Dunes. Both the course and the
conditions are relatively unfamiliar to the Bay
Area squad. Former Cardinal golfer Notah Begay
111 '95 who was a teammate of Tiger Woods
and Ray in his time on the Farm noted as
much in Wednesday's conference call, while
seeming concerned that Stanford does not
often play in this type of environment. However,
despite the steep learning curve that the unit
has faced in its practice rounds this week, Ray
believes that his squad knows how to handle the
swirling winds.

"We're excited to be at Prairie Dunes in
Hutchinson, Kansas; it's a Perry Maxwell de
sign, who's a famous old architect throughout
vthe United States," Ray said. "It's an epic golf
course, and even though it's out in the middle
of nowhere a bit, it's a very good golf course.
It's not uncommon for the wind to blow 20 to
30 miles an hour on a daily basis in the prairie
lands of Kansas, so we've been focusing this
week on our wind game and controlling our
shots, using the wind as our friend and as a
backstop ... keeping the ball on the ground is a
huge advantage."
A victory for the Cardinal at Prairie Dunes
would cap a tremendous season that has seen the
group win six events. The last time that Stanford
won six times in a regular season was back in
2007, when the Cardinal won their most recent
national championship, the eighth in program his
tory. It would also be the perfect send-off for the
graduating senior Wilson and the outgoing
Rodgers, given their significant contributions to
the team, and to the rich legacy of Stanford golf.
Both veterans noted that talented teams that the
Card have fielded in the past several years have
underperformed—last season's ouster at the re
gional, for example so Stanford is determined
to reverse that luck this time around.

"Our guys felt good about their play at the
regional," Ray remarked. "We didn't have the
best day in our final round, but that's part of win
ning: Wins come in all forms, and our motto this
year has been 'make winning a habit.' We've
done that here over the last couple months and
hope that will continue at NCAAs... spirits are
high and the vibe is great."

a solid performance to spur the Cardinal to their first national title since 2007.
