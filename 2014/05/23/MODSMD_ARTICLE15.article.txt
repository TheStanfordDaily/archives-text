# THE 						HUNGER STRIKES OF 1994
## 
### 
Twenty years ago this May, four
hunger strikers, with the support of
MEChA - the Chicano/a student
group on campus - did not eat for
three days as they protested what they
perceived to be a lack of University
support for the Chicano/a community.
Galvanized by the dismissal of Cecilia
Burciaga, the University's highest
ranking Latina administrator, the strik
ers had four demands that they com
municated to then-President Gerhard
Casper and then-Provost Condoleezza
Rice: a new position for Burciaga, the
creation of a Chicano/a studies
major, a campus-wide ban on grapes
and the creation of a community
center in East Palo Alto. Out of the
protests came the Center for Compara
tive Studies in Race and Ethnicity.

"It was a build up of a lot of things that had been happening both across campus and overall in this
nation about the status of Chicanos and Chicanas... everything just piled on and piled on and we said
'wait, we need to do something about it to change what's going on because nothing that we want to
happen is happening.'"

"Whenever we've had meetings and
got together with any of the adminis
tration, we don't get any results that
we are happy with and how extreme
the situation is on this campus and
how extreme things are outside, I
think it was the only way it would
touch their hearts to stop and think
about it. Or if we could get enough
bad press for this university that they
would have to stop and think about
it. Otherwise they weren't paying
attention, it would have just been
business as usual."

"Cecelia embodied all who we wanted to be. We all
wanted to be like her.... We all emulated her. And
for the University to say okay so now we're going
to take her away? We were like hell n0!... And
because Cecelia happened to be a woman, the
women were the ones that stood up and said we're
going to fight because what you're telling us is that
we can't reach our potential. And so I think that's
why it was the women that stood up."

JULIA GONZALEZ-LUNA '94, in 2014

"We collectively made the decision, it wasn't any one
person's decision, that the decision would be a
hunger strike. So myself personally, I felt very
strongly about the issues, and that it was something
that I could do. I was in good health, I felt my body
could take it."
