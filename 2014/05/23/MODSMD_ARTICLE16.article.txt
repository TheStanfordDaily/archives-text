# Puig's style of play should not be discouraged
## 
### Do-Hyoung Park 
My roommate lives and dies by
the fact that he is from Los An
geles. According to him, there is
no better place on Earth and he
cannot understand why people
would choose to live anywhere else.
I vehemently disagree with that opinion for
a list of reasons that could take up this entire
newspaper if I chose to flesh them out, but as a

fan of an NL West
team, nothing about
the city draws my ire
quite like the Los An
geles Dodgers. The
very idea of living in a
city, in which people
cheer for a team that
essentially amounts to

the West Coast's very own rich, spoiled cousin
that nobody else in the family likes, makes me
cringe.

That being said, one storyline has emerged
within the confines of Chavez Ravine that has
caught my eye and drawn my full attention over
the last season. You hear about him in some con
text every day, whether it is him making anoth
er laser throw to gun down a runner, or making
some hilarious mishap that will grace the air
time of Sports Center multiple times before the
next morning. If you are a baseball fan, you sim
ply cannot be ambivalent about him â€”you ei
ther love him or hate him.
You guessed it: I am talking about Yasiel
Puig.
We are just two weeks away from celebrat
ing the one-year anniversary of the Wild Horse
first galloping into the Major League Baseball
rodeo, and number 66 remains every bit as po
larizing, exhilarating, dynamic and immature
of a figure as he was a season ago when he first
drew the collective eyes of America to the
right-field grass in Dodger Stadium.
Last July, my colleague (and notorious
Dodger fan) Winston Shi wrote a column
about how it was Puig's imperfections that
made him such a polarizing figure. And in
deed, while the workmanlike Paul Gold
schmidt and the consistent Miguel Cabrera
put up bigger numbers in the long run, there

was seemingly no more talked about
baseball player on the planet than
Puig. As a matter of fact, a simple
Google Trends search shows that, on
average, Puig has been searched for
at twice the clip of Cabrera, Bryce
Harper and Mike Trout over the last
year.

In turn, it has become abun
dantly clear that Puig has deserved
all that attention, as he has followed
up on a breakout 2013 campaign
with a stellar start to the 2014 sea
son, as Puig is currently second in
the National League with 37 RBIs.
However, while his contributions
on the field are noteworthy enough
on their own, it is his unbridled en
thusiasm with which he approaches
the game every day that makes peo
ple so strongly opinionated about
him.

I, for one, cannot fathom why
people hate him for that. In sports,
it is quite common for people to
hate success I am guilty of this at
times as well but it is difficult for
me to hate what Puig does for his
team, arrogance and aggression be
darned. I think it is important to
have a figure like Puig that can spark
that energy and fire at any given mo
ment, especially for a team that is
struggling to meet expectations
early in this season like the Dodgers.
This hate arises from the expec
tation that baseball players need to
be subdued and mindful of the "eti
quette" of the game. Players are not
happy with players who watch their

home runs for too long. If you so
much as flip your bat wrong, you
will get jawed at. But why? Celebrat
ing big hits is commonplace in foot
ball, and when I am watching soc
cer, the goal celebrations are hon
estly some of the most exciting
things to see. Baseball is an emo
tional game and individual players
have an enormous impact on the
success of their team on every pitch
and as a fan, I love seeing Puig on
the field because he does not re
press that, letting his enthusiasm
for the game shine through.
Love him or hate him, Yasiel
Puig is here to stay, and in many peo
ple's minds, he needs to transform
himself from a raw talent filled with
emotion into a more "refined" and
"mature" ballplayer. However, I do
not want that to happen. I want to
see Puig mistakenly think that there
are two outs in an inning when there
are actually three and fire a rocket to
third base after a fly ball. I want to
see him messing around like a kid
with Adrian Gonzalez and Juan
Uribe. I want to see him flip his bat
and jaw at pitchers. I want to see
Yasiel Puig, and I do not want that
electric personality to go anywhere.
Never change, Yasiel. Never
change.

Child genius Do-Hyoung Park, like
Peter Pan, does not want Yaisel Puig
to grow up. To assure him that Yasiel
will be just fine, contact Do-Hyoung
