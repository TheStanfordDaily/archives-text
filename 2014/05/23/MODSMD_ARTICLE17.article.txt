## Women's golf falls to 14th after 54 holes at NCAA Championships 
### â€“ Cameron Miller 
After moving up into seventh
following Wednesday's second
round, the 12th-seeded Stanford

women's golf team slipped out of
the top 10 on Thursday, finding it
self in 14th at the NCAA Champi
onships. The Cardinal turned in the
third-worst Thursday score in the
24-squad field, posting a 14-over
294 at the Tulsa Country Club. In
the individual competition, sopho
more Lauren Kim is in a three-way
tie for third, with classmate Mariah

Stackhouse now sitting outside the
top 25 in a tie for 27th.
The third round began incredi
bly well for Anne Walker's quintet,
which vaulted into a tie for third by
virtue of completing its first nine
holes with a cumulative 1-over
score. Stanford was particularly suc
cessful on the par-5 16th hole,
recording two eagles, two birdies
and a par. However, the group was
unable to sustain its torrid pace in
the latter half of the round, shooting
13-over and tumbling down the
team leaderboard. Kim, who took
the individual lead with a birdie on
the par-4 18th, went 3-over on her
back nine, with three bogeys and a
double bogey dragging down her
performance. Nevertheless, Kim is
still within striking distance of the
leaders and sits only three strokes
back.

Stackhouse was unable to repli
cate her strong second round, post
ing three bogeys on the six par-4s on
the back nine en route to a 4-over
74. Her T-27th position is ahead of
her 29th-place finish at last year's
championships. If the statistics are
any indication, Stackhouse should
finish strong in today's final round,
given her 72.42 final round scoring
average this season.

The core of the Cardinal's is
sues in Tulsa, however, has been
their inability to produce solid third
and fourth scores. Freshman Casey
Danielson who showed incredi
ble promise during the spring sea
son and certainly has a bright future
on the Farm has not played up to
her potential with rounds of 79-72-
74. In addition, although senior
Marissa Mar has improved her
score with each successive day, she
is currently tied for 116 th in the
126-woman field. Finally, junior
Mariko Tumangan is still mired in a
slump, in which she has not cracked
the top 30 in any spring event.
Today's final round begins at 5
a.m., with Stanford teeing off be
tween 5:55 and 6:39. Live scoring is
available on NCAA.com.
