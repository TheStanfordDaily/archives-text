## Fighting for the future: the 1994 hunger strike Protests led to creation of CCSRE, undergraduate major

One long week in May, exactly 20 years
ago, a hunger strike sent Shockwaves
through a campus now known less for its
sense of activism and more for its ability to
churn out Silicon Valley startups.
"We wanted everyone to see us," said
Eva Silva '94 M.A. '95, reflecting on the
events that marked one of the largest and
most coordinated protests in recent Stan

We' was a group of four Chicana stu

Rice eliminated redundancies within the
University's administration. No department
or position was safe from cuts.
On the chopping blockwas Cecilia Bur
ciaga. Her position as associate dean of stu
dent affairs was deemed redundant and
folded into the Office of Development. At
the time, Burciaga, who had been at Stan
ford for 20 years, was the highest-ranking
Latino/a administrator at the University. In
addition, she and her husband Tony Burcia
ga were the resident fellows at Casa Zapata.
"She's an important contact for us,"
said Tamara Alvarado '95, one of the four
hunger strikers, in a video interview record
ed immediately after the strike. "There are
so few of us here, and so few of Chicano/a


Twenty years ago, on May 4, 1994, students began protesting in response to the dismissal of
Latina administrator Cecilia Burciaga and various racial slurs used during a FLiCKs screening.
