## Fighting for the future: the 1994 hunger strike Protests led to creation of CCSRE, undergraduate major 
### ANDREW VOGELEY DESK EDITOR 
One long week in May, exactly 20 years
ago, a hunger strike sent Shockwaves
through a campus now known less for its
sense of activism and more for its ability to
churn out Silicon Valley startups.
"We wanted everyone to see us," said
Eva Silva '94 M.A. '95, reflecting on the
events that marked one of the largest and
most coordinated protests in recent Stan
ford history.
We' was a group of four Chicana stu
dents, backed by MEChA de Stanford
the Chicano/a group on campus and var
ious faculty members, who went without
food for three days as they camped out in
the Quad in tents.

The protests, Silva said in an interview
immediately following their conclusion,
"were a buildup of a lot of things that had
been happening across campus and in this
country about the status of Chicanos and
Chicanas."
And the complaints were numerous.
But four injustices, in the eyes of the protes
tors, loomed largest and hurt the most.
The spark
Condoleezza Rice was the University's
Provost in 1994, second in command to
President Gerhard Casper. Her role includ
ed overseeing the budget at a time when the
University was running an annual deficit in
the range of $ 18-20 million.
As part of her plan to reduce and ulti
mately eliminate the University's deficit,

Rice eliminated redundancies within the
University's administration. No department
or position was safe from cuts.
On the chopping blockwas Cecilia Bur
ciaga. Her position as associate dean of stu
dent affairs was deemed redundant and
folded into the Office of Development. At
the time, Burciaga, who had been at Stan
ford for 20 years, was the highest-ranking
Latino/a administrator at the University. In
addition, she and her husband Tony Burcia
ga were the resident fellows at Casa Zapata.
"She's an important contact for us,"
said Tamara Alvarado '95, one of the four
hunger strikers, in a video interview record
ed immediately after the strike. "There are
so few of us here, and so few of Chicano/a

Latina administrator Cecilia Burciaga and various racial slurs used during a FLiCKs screening.
role models... she always has time to
hear us out."

Burciaga's role as a mentor for
many of the Latino/a students on
campus made the fact that she was
laid off even more difficult for a com
munity that was already struggling
with its identity at Stanford. Many of
the students that would ultimately
become the organizers of the
protests felt her layoff was another
example of University administra
tors' failure to understand and re
spect the different ethnic communi
ties on campus.
Stanford's culture today can
only be described as different from
what it was in 1994. There were con
cerns about diversity from both sides
of the issue some argued there
was too little; others argued there
was too much.
Much about the era can be
gleaned from the May 1, 1994
FLiCKs showing of "Mrs. Doubtfire."
Before this feature presentation, the
leaders of FLiCKs, in a move that was
quite common at the time, allowed
MEChA to screen "No Grapes," a
short film about the labor conditions
of California grape pickers.
Grapes would eventually be
come an issue of greater significance
in the protests, but on that night they
served merely as a catalyst for some
racist remarks.
"Beaners go home" and similar
taunts echoed throughout the audi
torium.
"Students were also throwing
food," Silva recalled. "We needed to
educate students about our cause
and our community."
The Chicano/a community had
had enough, and decided that a
hunger strike was the best and most
effective course of action.

"I think it was the only way it
would touch their hearts and [make
them] stop and think about [the is
sues facing the Chicano/a communi
ty]," said Elvira Prieto '96, one of the
hunger strikers and now the associ
ate director at El Centro Chicano,
after the strike.
"We looked at different kinds of
actions," Alvarado said. "We were
also heavily influenced by Cesar
Chavez —he did many hunger

strikes for many issues."
The strike
The four hunger strikers came
well prepared to the Quad on
Wednesday, May 4, armed with
tents, water, blankets and mattresses
for a strike that, in theory, could con
tinue indefinitely. They came with a
resolve to continue the strike until
they were satisfied. They also came
with demands a list of four

and an envoy of supporters. The de
mands covered a wide range of issues
that the strikers thought would
strengthen the Chicano/a communi
ty-

The first and perhaps most unre
alistic demand was for the adminis
tration to find another position for
Burciaga.
"We asked for an apology for Ce
cilia," Silva said. "We wanted her
back, but we knew in reality it would
be difficult [for us to secure her an
other job within the university]."

The second demand was the
creation of a Chicano/a studies
major.

"The Chicano Studies major
was envisioned back in the 70s, and
we've been waiting since then. Chi
canos are coming to be a majority in
California, maybe in the whole coun
try after awhile," saidjulia Gonzalez-
Luna '94 M.A. '95, another one of
the hunger strikers, in the video after
the conclusion of the strike. "It's
about time these issues get recog
nized and people realize we are not
going to go away."
The third request was perhaps
the most contentious and least un
derstood: a campus-wide ban on
grapes. The demand was an attempt
to better the working conditions of
the grape pickers, who were exposed
to pesticides while working in the
field and, the protesters believed,
were disrespected overall.

The final demand was the con
struction of a Stanford Chicano/a
community center in East Palo Alto,
as a means of connecting Stanford to
the greater community.
The first day, the team of nego
tiators — comprised primarily of
Jorge Solis '94, Gabbi Cervantes '94
and Alma Medina '92 J.D. '95
talked to Casper and Rice. Out of
those meetings came an offer from
Casper and Rice to form three com
mittees to explore the issues of
grapes, a Chicano/a studies major and
the construction of a community cen
ter in East Palo Alto. Casper and Rice
made no concessions on the issue of
finding Burciaga another position.
The offer was rejected.
Day two of the strike Thurs
day saw no progress in the talks
with the administration, but did see a
larger outpouring of community sup
port for the protestors. Some profes
sors taught their classes outside and
others gave speeches in acts of soli
darity.

Friday brought another intense
round of negotiations. An offer made
by the administration at 8 p.m. was
not much different than the first one

they added in a statement high
lighting the importance of Burciaga to
the community.
The negotiators decided to take

the offer to the members of MEChA
that Friday night. The future of the
strike would be determined by the
most democratic of processes: a sim
ple majority vote.

"We were a little divided —was
this agreement good enough?" Silva
said.

Ultimately, the group decided
that Casper's offer to form commit
tees to investigate the three issues
would suffice.

The negotiations team alerted
Casper and Rice to the results of the
vote. Casper and Rice then spent the
rest of the night tweaking the official
wording and language of the agree
ment. The hunger strike would offi
cially end on Saturday, May 7.
But the official ceremony Satur
day morning wasn't without drama.
The protestors seemed to think there
was an agreement that Casper and
Rice would sign the offer as a kind of
symbolic photo op. But Casper
balked, claiming no such agreement
was made. As the tension of the mo
ment began to rise, Casper and Rice,

perhaps sensing some sort of impend
ing public-relations disaster, decided
to sign the agreement.
Both sides claimed some victory
even though it was by no means a
complete victory for either side.

"I do think there was one bot
tom line: the University's processes
were respected. [The agreement
came out of] reasoned, productive
consideration," Rice told The Daily in
1994. "This is the way to move for
ward."

Casper and Rice were unavail
able for comment.

The significance
The most tangible long-term im
pact of the protests can best be found
in the creation of the Center for Com
parative Studies in Race and Ethnicity
(CCSRE) and the corresponding un
dergraduate program of Comparative
Studies in Race and Ethnicity (CSRE),
which includes the Chicano/a studies
major. The program created in
1996 out of the committee's sugges
tion — has provided a spot for Chi
cano/a studies, Asian American stud
ies, Jewish studies, Native American
Studies and a general comparative
studies concentration.

"It was a big deal for Stanford to
establish a Comparative Race and Eth
nicities major," Alvarado said. "For
me, the impact was beyond the uni
versity; it was national."
So while the legacy of the
protests most visibly lives on in the
form of CCSRE, the real legacy lies
within the impact the events had on
the protestors and the Stanford Chi
cano/a community.
"We have been re-inspired after
learning all the hard work that went
into planning and executing the
hunger strike," said Najla Gomez Ro
driguez ' 14, a Chicana community or
ganizer. "Learning about the struggles
they went through puts our own ex
perience in perspective and gives us
all the more reason to work harder in
every aspect."

The hunger strikers erected a tent in the center of the Main Quad and did
not leave their post beyond bathroom breaks and clinic visits. Each
striker had a sleeping bag and blankets, in addition to community support.
