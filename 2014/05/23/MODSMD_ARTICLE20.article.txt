## CANNES CANNES FILM FESTIVAL HEADS TO A CLOSE WITH "DEUX JOURS, UNE NUIT" AND "MOMMY" 
### ALEXANDRA HEENEY MANAGING EDITOR 
On my second last day in Cannes I
decided to skip the 8:30 a.m.
press screening, in favor of sleep.
Exhaustion is an occupational haz
ard at Cannes when trying to cram
in three movies a day, meals, sleep
and writing coverage. The film Iwas miss
ing was "The Search," the latest by

Michel Hazanavicius, best known for his
overly praised silent film, "The Artist." I
was dreading seeing it anyway, as Chuck
Williamson (@ch_williamson), on Twit
ter summed it up: 'A two-and-a-half hour
film set in war-torn Chechnya directed by
Michel Hazanavicius = my personal
hell." It received almost exclusively bad
reviews.

If you're willing to wait to see a film
until the day after all of the press frenzy

and buzz, you can see it at a more reason
able time, with a shorter line-up and pri
ority access. At most screenings, there's
a rank order of press passes, and if you've
got the lowest priority badge, like this
journalist, you can line up for two hours
and not even get in. But at La Salle du
Soixantieme, where day-after screenings
are held, I showed up at about 11:15 a.m.
for a 12 p.m. screening and was maybe
50th in the press line, which gets let in
first. By that time, there were already
hundreds of people in line with industry
badges, referred to as "Marche de Film,"
who only get access to the screenings
after all the press are seated.
I was there to see the new film by
two-time Palme d'OrwinnersJean-Pierre
and Luc Dardenne, "Deux Jours, Une
Nuit," starring Marion Cotillard. The day
before, people were praising it as a mas
terpiece, predicting a long-overdue
Cannes Best Actress award for Cotillard,
and a third Palme for the Belgian broth
ers. But one of the things I've learned
here on the Croisette this week is that re
views at the festival tend to be hyperbol
ic: critics denounce mediocre films as
utter trash and call merely good films
'masterpieces.'
