## CANNES CANNES FILM FESTIVAL HEADS TO A CLOSE WITH "DEUX JOURS, UNE NUIT" AND "MOMMY" 
### ALEXANDRA HEENEY MANAGING EDITOR 
On my second last day in Cannes I
decided to skip the 8:30 a.m.
press screening, in favor of sleep.
Exhaustion is an occupational haz
ard at Cannes when trying to cram
in three movies a day, meals, sleep
and writing coverage. The film Iwas miss
ing was "The Search," the latest by

Michel Hazanavicius, best known for his
overly praised silent film, "The Artist." I
was dreading seeing it anyway, as Chuck
Williamson (@ch_williamson), on Twit
ter summed it up: 'A two-and-a-half hour
film set in war-torn Chechnya directed by
Michel Hazanavicius = my personal
hell." It received almost exclusively bad
reviews.

If you're willing to wait to see a film
until the day after all of the press frenzy

and buzz, you can see it at a more reason
able time, with a shorter line-up and pri
ority access. At most screenings, there's
a rank order of press passes, and if you've
got the lowest priority badge, like this
journalist, you can line up for two hours
and not even get in. But at La Salle du
Soixantieme, where day-after screenings
are held, I showed up at about 11:15 a.m.
for a 12 p.m. screening and was maybe
50th in the press line, which gets let in
first. By that time, there were already
hundreds of people in line with industry
badges, referred to as "Marche de Film,"
who only get access to the screenings
after all the press are seated.
I was there to see the new film by
two-time Palme d'OrwinnersJean-Pierre
and Luc Dardenne, "Deux Jours, Une
Nuit," starring Marion Cotillard. The day
before, people were praising it as a mas
terpiece, predicting a long-overdue
Cannes Best Actress award for Cotillard,
and a third Palme for the Belgian broth
ers. But one of the things I've learned
here on the Croisette this week is that re
views at the festival tend to be hyperbol
ic: critics denounce mediocre films as
utter trash and call merely good films
'masterpieces.'

Because there are relatively few
films screened, about 60 overall com
pared to the 300 at the Toronto Inter
national Film Festival, and everyone
sees them on the same day, there's
enormous pressure to get your re
view out there quickly before it's no
longer buzzworthy. This rush to pub
lish, often less than two hours after a
film finishes, means the opinions
written aren't particularly consid
ered: critics denounced Atom Egoy
an's flawed but well-directed "Cap
tives" as beyond terrible, and within a
few days, other outlets had further
propagated this exaggeration. De
spite being a fan of the Dardennes, I
walked into the screening with a
healthy dose of skepticism.
"Deux Jours, Une Nuit" is a very
good film by the Howard Hawks def
inition â€” "Three great scenes, no
bad scenes" but it wasn't as emo
tionally stirring as I suspect it was try
ing to be. It was the story of Sandra
(Marion Cotillard), a married woman
and mother-of-two recovering from
depression, who finds out her boss
has just polled her co-workers to de
cide if she gets to keep her job a vote:
they can either vote to fire her or to
give up their 1000 Euros bonus. They
vote for the bonus, 14-2, but it wasn't
an anonymous vote and one of their
supervisors was deliberately scaring
people into voting against Sandra.
When she manages to get her
boss to agree to a re-vote on Monday,

she has the weekend to visit each of
her coworkers at home to try to per
suade them to vote her way. Sandra
is convinced it's a fool's errand: her
self-confidence is still at a low, and
she understands the other employ
ees need the money from their
bonus. Since her family depends on
the income from her salary, she re
luctantly sets out.

I've never seen Marion Cotillard
be anything short of great, and this is
no exception. The Dardennes favour
long, uncut takes, which lets us
watch Cotillard convincingly go
through multiple emotions within
the space of minutes, a real feat.
They also shoot her walking towards
each of her coworker's homes, and
there's a subtle shift in her posture
and gait as she gains confidence. She
starts off slouched and shaky, but
fiercely determined. As more people
agree to vote her way, she wavers less
and less. When making her requests,
there's the perfect balance of trepi
dation and strength, fear and deter
mination. If she were to win the Best
Actress award, it would be richly de
served.

After the train wreck that was
Jean-Luc Godard's 2010 "Film Social
isme," a perplexing film intentionally
without subtitles meant to alienate
the non-French-speaking audience (I
speak French and I still had no clue
what it was about), I decided to skip
his new 3D film, "Goodbye to Lan

guage." Instead, I headed over to one
of the festival's sidebars, the Direc
tors' Fortnight, to see the latest from
Studio Ghibli, "The Tale of Princess
Kaguya," directed by Isao Takahata.
It's a gorgeously drawn film, where
the landscapes look like watercolor

paintings, and the characters are
beautifully etched in charcoal.

The film is about a bamboo cut
ter who finds a doll-sized person who
looks like a Princess in a bamboo
stalk. Within seconds, she trans
forms into a human baby who

screams and cries, and before long,
she is doing bare-bottomed somer
saults. The young girl gets the nick
name "Little Bamboo" from the local
kids because she grows up unusually

quickly: within weeks, she's a full-grown
woman.

Before long, her adopted father decides to
move them all to a mansion in the city, where
she can get an upbringing befitting of a
princess-to-be. She's a reluctant student, pre
ferring the freedom she had in her youth, and
there's a somewhat interesting narrative about
how gross it is that she's being trained to be
come some man's property. The middle stretch
drags quite a bit at over two hours, the film
could lose about a quarter and not miss much
but this is a buoyant tale with humor and visual
wit, without the promise of a Disney happy
ending.

After a quick dinner at the bizarre Ameri
can-owned burger place across the street from
the Palais half the employees only speak
English, and the other half only speak French
and some macarons from Laduree, I re
turned to the Palais for the press screening of
Xavier Dolan's "Mommy." At just 25, this is the
fifth film from the French-Canadian director,
and its his fourth to screen Cannes. It is, how
ever, the first time he's had a slot in the Official
Competition: he took his last film to Venice out
of spite for not getting into the Competition

the last time he was here. Since the film is
Quebecois, where they speak their own dialect
of French with anglicized slang, a "joual" ac
cent, and swear words like "tabernac," other
wise unknown in the French-speaking world,
Dolan wrote French subtitles, which screened
with the film.

"Mommy" was warmly applauded at
Wednesday's press screening, which has
quickly turned it into a front-runner for the
Palmed' Or. It's certainly one of the best films
I've seen in Competition. Dolan has a singular
vision, and he's crafted a funny, emotional,
personal, and provocative film. Shot it in the
unusual 1:1 aspect ratio, like Instagram, the
characters are necessarily very close to one an
other when in close-ups, or they wouldn't all fit
into the frame. If a character is looking at
something, the camera has to move to show us
what.

As the story of the too-close relationship
between a mother, Die (Anne Dorval) and her
troubled son, Steve (Antoine-Olivier Pilon),
who feel like society is out to get them, the 1:1
aspect ratio makes the film feel appropriately
claustrophobic. Gorgeously and expertly shot
by cinematographer Andre Turpin, you quickly

forget that the aspect ratio reminds you of
something you could shoot on your phone:
there's nothing amateurish here. There seems
to be hope when their neighbor Kyla (Suzanne
Clement) comes into their orbit, a former
teacher with a newly developed stutter, who
helps Steve get on track, and brings warmth
into their relationship. But Steve has a short
fuse, and we're told at the beginning of the film
that it's the future, and Canada has implement
ed a new law that allows parents to send their
children to a mental institution, no questions
asked, if they become too much to handle. The
law is a ticking time bomb.
As Steve, the blond-haired Pilon is charis
matic and goofy at times, and rash and violent

at others. Even when he's at his most lovable,
there's the suggestion of something darker that
lies beneath. Clement makes Kyla a quiet and
compassionate woman, easily seduced by Die's
fast-talking and Steve's childish doting. Togeth
er, they help Kyla come out of her shell, and re
discover the joie de vivre. Dorval steals the
show as the fiesty Die, whose potty mouth and
love of a good time mask the fact that she's ill
equipped to deal with her son's problems and
may be a source of them. Much of what she says
is hilarious, which makes the otherwise dark
film, easier to swallow.
