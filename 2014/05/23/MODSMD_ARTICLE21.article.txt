## Next to Normal hits good notes 
### KATIE STRAUB CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Open the director's note of the Next to Normal pro
gram to find the following instruction from direc
tor Allison Gold 'l5: "Open yourself for the next
few hours, and let yourself feel everything."
These are pertinent words for any audience mem
ber about to see "Next to Normal." The musical
follows the ups and downs of suburban mother Diane
Goodman, who struggles with the destructive effects her
bipolar disorder while trying to maintain the glossy sheen
of "a perfect family." As illness pervades her life, Diane's
family becomes torn to pieces, and all characters in the
musical try to cope with issues of grief, depression, drug

range of human emotion seen in its characters. Given the
plotline, the show is often solemn and serious, but this
production does not miss on opportunities to demon

sarcasm and even dark, grim humor. And it all feels real.
Part of this, of course, is written into the show itself.
It's a "rock musical," fueled by strong pop singing, thump
ing bass and twanging guitar, and the lyrics often demon
strate a surprising realness in the character's struggles.
Some are heavy: "Do you wake up in the morning and
need help to lift your head?" sings Diane, or Natalie sings
