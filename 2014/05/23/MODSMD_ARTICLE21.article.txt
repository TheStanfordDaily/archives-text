## Next to Normal hits good notes 
### KATIE STRAUB CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Open the director's note of the Next to Normal pro
gram to find the following instruction from direc
tor Allison Gold 'l5: "Open yourself for the next
few hours, and let yourself feel everything."
These are pertinent words for any audience mem
ber about to see "Next to Normal." The musical
follows the ups and downs of suburban mother Diane
Goodman, who struggles with the destructive effects her
bipolar disorder while trying to maintain the glossy sheen
of "a perfect family." As illness pervades her life, Diane's
family becomes torn to pieces, and all characters in the
musical try to cope with issues of grief, depression, drug
abuse and suicide.

It's a trying show, one that will put an audience and
its cast members through the wringer. Yet Ram's Head's
production of "Next to Normal" hits the necessary notes
for a powerful production.
Immediate strengths of the production are seen
quickly and clearly. From the first number, we witness
impressive vocal work from the entire cast. Robert Poole
'l4 as the family's son, Samantha Williams 'l7 as the
daughter, and Peter Kurzner 'l7 as Natalie's boyfriend
are vocal standouts in their solos, but group numbers in
particular are sung with a force and skill that bring goose
bumps to the skin. The set and lighting are creatively
imagined by Keenan Molner' 15 to transform the Elliot
Programming Center into a new world. We watch as we
move from kitchen to hospital to school and even to
dream worlds, all punctuated by lighting to fit the feel
and emotion.

But an important triumph of the show is the realistic
range of human emotion seen in its characters. Given the
plotline, the show is often solemn and serious, but this
production does not miss on opportunities to demon
strate for characters to exhibit delight, compassion, fury,
sarcasm and even dark, grim humor. And it all feels real.
Part of this, of course, is written into the show itself.
It's a "rock musical," fueled by strong pop singing, thump
ing bass and twanging guitar, and the lyrics often demon
strate a surprising realness in the character's struggles.
Some are heavy: "Do you wake up in the morning and
need help to lift your head?" sings Diane, or Natalie sings
"Some days I think I'm dying, but I'm really only trying to
get through." But others are more
off-handed and even humorous,
"Living on a latte and a prayer," sings
Dan, the father, "I'm a sociopath,
not Sylvia Plath," Diane sings from
the psych ward, and "These are a
few of my favorite pills," they all
sing, in chorus.
This may appear flippant at first,
in the face of such large issues. But,
owed perhaps in equal parts to talent
ed acting and smart direction, charac
ters occupy the stage with an energy
and honesty that is as deeply human
in their struggles to survive—we
sympathize and relate to them.
In particular, Megan Gage 'l5

plays Diane with a striking instinctual
ferocity. Her manic highs are stun
ning; she is her most natural on stage
when crawling around floors or liter
ally tangoing with her psychophar
macologist. Her approach to Diane is
often sarcastic and fiery, making her
feel appropriately alien to her family
and the audience. When she drops
into rare moments of true despair,
her performance is moving. Brady
Richter's 'l5 characterization of the
father is at times campy, but comes
from a place of authentic exhaustion
and depression that feels right. The
list goes on an important authen
ticity is regularly detected at the

heart of each of these characters. It is
this commitment to humanity that
makes the audience able to "feel
everything" and meet Gold's request.

Next to Normal shows this week
end, May 22-24 at Bp.m., in the El
liot Programming Center. Admis
sion is free. The show was spon
sored by (among other organiza
tions) Stanford's Psych One pro
gram, to integrate arts and academ

tal illness in the arts.
