## Drag at the d.school 
### KATIE STRAUB CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A drag show in the d.school: "Art as Identity" ex
plores gender norms. Neal Ulrich 'l6 stands
on the floor of the d.school atrium, decked
head to toe in a dramatic red ball gown, adjust
ing the top of a chestnut wig to meet his hair
line. As eager audience members file in to find
seats, they hoot and holler excitedly upon seeing Ulrich.
He smiles and laughs, easily 6-foot-4 in his golden high
heels. "Sissy That Walk" by RuPaul blares in the back
ground.

After a few minutes, Brianne Huntsman' 15 steps to
the front of the atrium and commands the audience's at
tention. "Thankyou, Dina!" she shouts, motioning to Ul
rich, whose oh-so-fabulous drag queen pseudonym hap
pens to be "Dina Mite." From his place flitting around
the room, Ulrich then takes his position. Before long, an

other RuPaul track crescendos, Ulrich strut-strut-struts
across the atrium, bolstered by a wave of cheers. The
show begins.

The show was indeed a drag show, entitled "Art as
Identity," and was imagined and executed by Ulrich and
Huntsman for a one-time-only performance last week.
Funded by the Stanford Arts Institute, the show was a
product of a MashUp grant, a flash grant designed for
student artists from differing artistic disciplines to come
together in making an exciting, collaborative artwork.
Ulrich, a longtime singer and performer, and Hunts
man, an experienced costume designer for theater,
knew each other from working part time in the LGBT
center and their mutual major in product design. They
had not, however, collaborated artistically. As they ex
plained, it made immediate sense to them to undertake
this project in particular.

"I've recently become interest
ed in drag in general," Ulrich said. "I
was talking to Brie very casually
about it... Then this grant opportu
nity came through our mailbox, and
she was like, 'wait, we should do
this.'"

Over a grand total of just five weeks
(hence the "flash grant"), Ulrich and
Huntsman worked to create their
show. For her part, Huntsman craft
ed a full ball gown for Ulrich to wear
as Dina Mite a full-length red
dress with golden buttons, com
plete with a classic Hollywood-style
halter-top and flowing train. Over 10
yards of fabric, Huntsman explained,
were used for the dress's skirt section
alone.

Meanwhile, Ulrich would wear
the piece as Dina Mite. To do so, he
underwent a significant amount of
body modification for the show: he
applied drag stage make-up and built
feminine-looking hip pads to be worn
beneath Huntsman's dress.

The show started with a campy
high-heeled catwalk performance by
Ulrich and led into the lip-synch act
a classic formula in popular drag
shows today. The song wonderfully
and hilariously over-the-top lip
synch to Cher's "Believe," complete
with exaggerated head bobbles, furi
ous hand and finger waving, dramat
ic leg flinging and billowing full
turns.

The history of drag as an art
form, Ulrich and Huntsman ex
plained, is distinctly separate from
being transgendered. Drag began in
mid-20th century Harlem, where
groups of black, low-income, LGBT
men would organize drag "balls" to
dress up, temporarily, as certain
identities.

"They would dress up to affect
an identity that they could not oth
erwise belong to," Ulrich explained.
"There was a lot of female imper
sonation, but also people dressing
up as business executives or high
fashion models. It was about putting
yourself in that place of privilege."
For Ulrich and Huntsman, drag
today occupies a more entertain
ment-based space in club scenes
and television shows, but it still has

a socially conscious intention.
"Drag really highlights how we
present ourselves and what we
think of as feminine," Ulrich ex
plained. "If I'm saying, I'm dressing
up as a woman, what does that
mean? [Drag] is making very clear
how society defines femininity."
Huntsman elaborated that drag
can also make larger comments on
the performativity of any identity, in
cluding that of a Stanford student,
for example.
"We just wanted to bring con
versation about drag and identity to
Stanford," Huntsman said. "You
dress yourself in a specific way, and
you elicit reactions that you proba
bly want to elicit. Everybody pres
ents themselves in a certain way be
cause they want to be treated in a
certain way."
As the duo wanted to explore
such questions, the end of "Art as
Identity" also featured a faux-inter
view series of questions and answers
on the subject, in front of the audi
ence.

"It's about breaking the rules
that people say, 'this is how you have
to dress, and this is how you have to
act,'" Ulrich said at the end of the per
formance. "I don't necessarily want
to live my life as a woman, but it's an
exciting transformation... Like, why
not? Don't police my gender!"
Judging from the snaps and
shouts in response from the audi
ence that night, many were in agree
ment.

"What I really want people to
do is to show up and have a good
time. Dress how you want, come as
you are," Huntsman said of her ulti
mate intentions for the show.
"There is a lot a gender theory be
hind this...but let's just take over
the d. school for an hour and have
fun."
Hear, hear.
