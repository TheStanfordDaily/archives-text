## Drag at the d.school 
### KATIE STRAUB CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A drag show in the d.school: "Art as Identity" ex
plores gender norms. Neal Ulrich 'l6 stands
on the floor of the d.school atrium, decked
head to toe in a dramatic red ball gown, adjust
ing the top of a chestnut wig to meet his hair
line. As eager audience members file in to find
seats, they hoot and holler excitedly upon seeing Ulrich.
He smiles and laughs, easily 6-foot-4 in his golden high
heels. "Sissy That Walk" by RuPaul blares in the back
ground.

After a few minutes, Brianne Huntsman' 15 steps to
the front of the atrium and commands the audience's at
tention. "Thankyou, Dina!" she shouts, motioning to Ul
rich, whose oh-so-fabulous drag queen pseudonym hap
pens to be "Dina Mite." From his place flitting around
the room, Ulrich then takes his position. Before long, an

other RuPaul track crescendos, Ulrich strut-strut-struts
across the atrium, bolstered by a wave of cheers. The
show begins.

The show was indeed a drag show, entitled "Art as
Identity," and was imagined and executed by Ulrich and
Huntsman for a one-time-only performance last week.
Funded by the Stanford Arts Institute, the show was a
product of a MashUp grant, a flash grant designed for
student artists from differing artistic disciplines to come
together in making an exciting, collaborative artwork.
Ulrich, a longtime singer and performer, and Hunts
man, an experienced costume designer for theater,
knew each other from working part time in the LGBT
center and their mutual major in product design. They
had not, however, collaborated artistically. As they ex
plained, it made immediate sense to them to undertake
this project in particular.
