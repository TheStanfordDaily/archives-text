## Stanford Shakes puts on "The Winter's Tale" 
### TULIO OSPINA 
Thousands of years ago, our
common ancestors began
telling stories by casting shad
ows against the walls of caves.
By the light of fire, humans de
veloped the skill of storytelling
to closer accompany their hungry
imaginations. The shadows were
eventually embodied by the figures
they represented, which led to the
creation of theater. This year's cho
sen venue for the Stanford Shake
speare Company's spring show of
"The Winter's Tale" transports the
audience back to this deeply ances
tral form of entertainment.

Performed May 22 - 25 at 8 p.m.
and located outdoors at Josef Alber's
"Stanford Wall," the play is a mes
merizing experience that manages to
blur the boundary between play and
virtual dreamworld. The production
begins at a twilight hour that is just

dim enough for the stringed lights
hung above the audience's seats to
glow warmly. Approaching the
venue, after passing under Little
field's Romanesque arched passage
way, one can see the tops of two
small tents hidden behind the trees
of an enclosed field like stum
bling upon a troupe of traveling per
formers in the woods.

Adjacent to these tents stands
the Stanford Wall. It is 50 feet in
length, made of brick and striped by
several metal bars. During the per
formance of "The Winter's Tale," it
serves as the backdrop and stage, lit
up from afar and connected on
ground level with the audience. The
smell of hay and blossoming trees
perfume the air while faint acoustic
folk music strums into the night. Re
markably, Insiya Jafferjee 'l4 and
Yura Kim' 17, the play's technical di
rector and set designer, respectively,
have likened the theater space to the

coziness of a farm.
Shakespeare's strange tragicom
edy shows the story of King Leontes
(Matthew Libby 'l7) whose unwar
ranted jealousy over his pregnant
wife, Hermione (Hanna Tyson 'l7),
drives him to stubborn madness and
tragically leads to her death, as well
as their son's (Lora Kelley 'l7). False
ly believing that he has been made a
cuckold, despite the pleading re
marks by Paulina (Sunny Huang 'l4)
that cry otherwise, Leontes banishes
his newborn "bastard" daughter to
the wilderness where a bumbling old
shepherd (Kevin Hurlbutt 'l7) dis
covers her.
As the first half of the play ca
reens towards tragic conclusions, the
skies around the Stanford Wall grad
ually darken, sucking the audience
into the world that Shakespeare has
imagined and Nora Tjossem' 15, the
play's director, has created. An in
door theater performance would
dim the lights before the perform
ance to command the audience's at
tention. Tjossem's rendition of "The
Winter's Tale" uses the naturally fad
ing sunlight for the same effect. An
hour into the play, as the darkness of
night shrouds the lit up stage and lim
its one's vision to it, the world of the
play is indefinitely expanded into its
dark surroundings. The feeling is
analogous to lying down to rest and
unexpectedly finding oneself asleep
and dreaming.
Watching the actors' shadows
splayed across the brick wall is so
primitively familiar and the story so
transporting that the roaring of air
planes that sometimes pass overhead
is shockingly out of place.

The latter half of the play oddly
twists the circumstances into a
happy comedy with many ridiculous
characters tromping across the stage.
The hard-of-hearing shepherd and
his jester-like son (Kaya Mc√üuer 'l7)
are a hilarious duo who are repeated
ly conned out of their gold by the fast
talking and slimy Autolycus (also Kel
ley).

There is a fantastic "sheep
shearing" festival scene where the
two have unwittingly invited their
king Polixenes (Graham Roth B.S.' 10
M.S. 'l4) and his close friend Camil
lo (Jackie Emerson' 17) who are both
disguised as bent old men. It is an oc
casion of celebration where Polix
enes' son Florizel (Patrick O'Hare
'l7) announces his desire to wed
with the Shepherd's daughter Perdi

ta (Melanie Arnold 'l6), who is un
knowingly the banished daughter of
Hermione. The actors pair off and
square dance to a fiddling tune. Try
not to stand up and clap along to their
celebratory enjoyment.
When you go to see this reimag
ining of Shakespeare's late romance,
make sure to bring warm blankets
and good friends, as the performance
goes into the cool night. The warmth
of the play and the bundling up
against close friends keep the chilli
ness of the brisk carnival air at bay.
And do not be surprised if you find
yourself suddenly shipped away to
sea in a world of jealous kings and
howling fools, or vice versa.
