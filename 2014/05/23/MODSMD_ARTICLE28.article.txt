# ON CAMPUS
## Poetry Out Loud returns 
### MARTY SEMILLA 
Last Wednesday marked the final competition
for the third annual "Poetry Out Loud" event,
which was sponsored by the English Depart
ment and Creative Writing Program and held
in the Terrace Room in Margaret Jacks Hall.
The competition showcased 10 strong final
ists, and, after weeks of memorization and training,
these finalists were ready to give their A-game. Not
only did were the finalists a diverse group of Stanford
students (only two of whom were English majors),
they brought to the table a diverse collection of poet
ry, ranging from contemporary poetry to well-known
classics, for example, Edgar Allen Poe's "The Raven."
Graduate students Abigail Droge and Justin
Tackett, two members of the Poetry Out Loud Com
mittee, began the event by telling the audience that
this event was a return to poetry's roots as a vocal
experience. The audience was definitely not disap
pointed. All of the performers had a strong control
over their poems, and they each used that to the
best of their abilities. Some commanded the atten
tion of an already focused audience with a single
syllable. Others were earnest in their approach, al
lowing the audience to see what was in their heart.
A brave few fully inhabited the words of their poems,
creating personas that were remarkably different and

complex.
Droge and Tackett were, however, slightly mis
taken. What the audience saw that night was not only
a vocal experience, it was also a physical experience.
The body language of the performers was open and
inviting, and I felt more connected to the material
that they had held close to their hearts. Some finalists
swayed to the rhythm of their words while others
used hand and arm gestures freely to carry out their
words. Droge and Tackett urged us to "think about
the 'ahs,' the words, and the voices," but seeing how
these performers communicate and define those
'ahs' is another pleasure in it of itself.
After some deliberation, the judge, lecturer
Keith Ekiss, declared that Marianne Dang ' 17, who
had performed "Tulips" by Sylvia Plath won, with sec
ond place going to Elliot Williams' 15 for "Let Amer
ican Be America Again" by Langston Hughes and
third place going to Gabriela Quintana 'l4 for "The
Language of the Brag" by Sharon Olds.
For those who missed out on the event or for
those who want a second try, never fear. "Poetry Out
Loud" will continue as long as there is demand, and
with any luck, poetry as an art form will blossom
throughout campus and inspire everyone, even the
"techies."
