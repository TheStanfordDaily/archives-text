## Snapshots of activism from the past 
### NITISH KULKARNI DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
Stanford has a long and colorful his
tory of student activism, with students
protesting incidents ranging from the
Rodney King beating in 1992 to a bicycle
ban in the Main Quad in 2006. Protests
in recent years at Stanford have cen
tered around LGBTQ rights, Stanford
worker pay and equal opportunity is
sues, especially for custodial staff.

Here are some notable activist
events in Stanford's recent history:

■ On April 7,2002, close to 1,000 stu
dents, staff and workers protested
Stanford's treatment of University
workers and their comparative pay.
The demonstrators marched from
Memorial Auditorium, down Palm
Drive and into the courtyard of the
Littlefield building, which housed
the business school at the time.
■ On March 3, 2003, approximately
1,000 students rallied against a pre
emptive war in Iraq, as a part of the
"Books, Not Bombs" movement
against such military action. Many
faculty members canceled lectures
and other academic events.
■ On May 28, 2003, about 100 work
ers and students gathered outside of
President Hennessy's office at Build
ing 10 in the Main Quad to seek
changes in the employment policies
for staff of Stanford University.
■On June 15, 2006, over 1,000 stu
dents, faculty and staff protested at a
meeting between then-President
George W. Bush and the Fellows of
the Hoover Institution. The protest
pushed the Presidential convoy off
campus and forced a change in venue
for the protest. Three students were
arrested and charged with misde
meanors: failure to yield to an official
vehicle in a restricted area and ob
struction of police activity.
