# Q&A ALBERT CAMARILLO
## PROFESSOR OF AMERICAN HISTORY 
### KYLIE JUE DESK EDITOR 
Albert Camarillo, professor of American history, was the
founding director of the Center for Comparative Studies in Race
and Ethnicity (CCSRE) in 1996. Amemberofthe History Depart
ment since 1975, Camarillo was also the founding director of the
Stanford Center for Chicano Research from 1980-1985, and
played a large supporting role during the student hunger strike in
1994.

The Daily sat down to discuss the development of the
CCSRE in the aftermath of the hunger strike as well as his
thoughts on the changes in the campus culture regarding race
and ethnicity.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): So do you thinkyou can start by talk
ing about how the Center for Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity began in context of the hunger strike of 1994?

Albert Camarillo was the founding director of the Center
for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity in 1996, and
a central supporting figure during the 1994 hunger strike.
Albert Camarillo (AC): The idea for something
like CCSRE formed before the hunger strike.
Back in 1993 there was a group of faculty, across
a number of social sciences and humanities de
partments that were discussing the idea of possi
bly bringing together the faculty to create some
center. [At the time,] there were seminars that
the University had funded from the Andrew Mel
lon Foundation and gave money to the University
to support faculty seminars. And so we received
a two-year grant to bring together faculty and
start talking about race and ethnicity.
So there was already a group of people
thinking about making a subset, a research cen
ter, not so much for students and teaching. And
that's when the hunger strike came along de
manding a Chicano studies program... and the
decision at the time, because of the intellectual
inertia already in comparative studies, was not to
develop a Chicano Studies program separate
from, but be a part of programming comparing
race and ethnicity. And so at that time we decid
ed, the faculty together with students, that we
were going to create a center that had both an un
dergraduate program and a research institute to
support the research and other intellectual activ
ities of faculty and graduate students. So the two
things converged.

TSD: Couldyoutalkabitabouthowthe commit
tee developed the CCSRE program?

AC: Typically what happens is that the dean, or
sometimes it could be a provost or president,
they call a committee together and they give the
committee a great deal of autonomy to come up
with proposals or recommendations.
And so the committee [for developing
CCSRE] met for quite a few months, did a big as
sessment of ethnic studies, related programs
across the nation, to see what kind of models ex
isted. And in the end, [it] decided to do some
thing pretty different no other program that
had been created had been comparative across
and between groups, domestic and internation
al.

TSD: How was the campus culture then com
pared to what it is today, and what was it like to
be on campus at the time of the strike?

AC: It was an intense period of time, and as long
as I've been here, in 40 years, there have never
been hunger strikes. There have been demon
strations, but nothing as dramatic as a hunger
strike. When you get people fasting for one or

two, three or four days, then it becomes a med
ical issue, it becomes a crisis. Everyone wanted
to avert the crisis of actually harming student
health and taking up the issues that they felt the
University could deal with. There were a number
of committees that were established to take up
particular parts of the demands by the strikers. I
was involved with only the one with the curricula
side of it.

TSD: What would you say was the long-term im
pact of the 1994 hunger strike?

AC: The strike mobilized the students and it later
mobilized the administration and the faculty to
create something that now is almost 20 years old.
And in the end, I think it was an important factor
as an impetus for the institutionalization of eth
nic studies at Stanford.

TSD: What is your involvement with CCSRE
now and what are your hopes for the future of
the center?

AC: I'm not the director of the center anymore.
But my current role is to help departments and
schools find new faculty and hopefully appoint
them. By the beginning of next year, we would
have 13 faculty appointed over the last seven
years whose work focuses on the study of race
and ethnicity. And these are really successful
people that we've hired.
My involvement with the center all these
years ...we viewed our mission and this with
faculty and students and staff together to cre
ate the premier intellectual center of its time in
the world studying race and ethnicity, and we've
achieved that goal already.
