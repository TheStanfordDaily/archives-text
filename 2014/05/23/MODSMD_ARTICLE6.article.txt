## CSRE: From strike to impact 
### KYLIE JUE DESK EDITOR 
Established in 1996, shortly after
and partly in response to the hunger
strike of 1994, Stanford's undergradu
ate program in Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity (CSRE) is the fastest
growing major at the University. The
CSRE major is the largest of five offered
by the Center for Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity (CCSRE).
According to professor of compara
tive literature David Palumbo-Liu, one of
CCSRE's founding faculty members and
director of the Undergraduate Program
in CSRE, the program's flexible curricu
lum and unique focus on comparative
studies draws on average 25 to 30 new
majors each year.
The Director of the CCSRE, Jose
David Saldivar M.A. '79 Ph.D. 'B3, also
spoke about the program's growth.
"Since 1996, CSRE has probably
been the fastest-growing major in the
University," Saldivar said. "We've had
over 450 majors and minors... In June
2013, we graduated our largest under
graduate class close to 55 to 60 [stu
dents]."

An interdepartmental program
The CSRE program is an interde
partmental program that houses five dif
ferent majors: Asian American Studies,
Chicana/o-Latina/o Studies, Compara
tive Studies in Race and Ethnicity, Jew
ish Studies and Native American Stud
ies.

"One of the things that we were
adamant about was that it would com
parative," Palumbo-Liu said. "We creat
ed this umbrella CSRE under
which those programs sit, but there is
also yet another major simply called
Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnic
ity, and that's by far our most popular
major."

Palumbo-Liu also emphasized the
program's flexibility and explained that
students can design their course path
around a theme of their choice.

"Our actual requirements are not

onerous at all, but we do leave it up to
the students to either create a thematic
cluster of their own or else adapt one
that we already have intersectional,
public health, migrations, sexuality,"
Palumbo-Liu said.

Since the program is interdepart
mental, all affiliated faculty members
are volunteers and come from several
different departments on campus. The
CCSRE encompasses two major compo
nents: research and the undergraduate
study program.
"It's a volunteer interdepartmental
program," Palumbo-Liu said. "We're
here because we want to invest a certain
amount of our time sustaining the pro
gram, and it's been sustained now for a
good long time."

How it began
Despite being approved shortly
after the protests in November 1996,
the CSRE program had origins well be
fore the 1994 hunger strike.
Palumbo-Liu spoke about the Uni
versity Committee on Minority Issues
(UCMI), which compiled a commission
in 1989 that contained extensive re
search on minority issues on campus.
He explained that although the commis
sion was looked over, the issues were
not directly addressed. The committee
was chaired by Albert Camarillo, profes
sor of American History and the found
ing director of the CCSRE.
However, Camarillo emphasized
the importance of discussions about
race and ethnicity rather than the UCMI
in the development of the CCSRE. Ac
cording to Camarillo, before the CSRE
program, a group of faculty from the hu
manities and social science departments
received a two-year grant to hold semi
nars around the topics in 1992 or 1993.
Just as faculty began considering
the development of a research center,
protests around the issues surrounding
ethnicity began to heat up, and the firing
of University administrator Cecilia Bur
ciaga sparked the 1994 hunger strike.
The strikers' demands included a re
quest for a Chicano studies program,

and after the protests, several University
committees were established to address
the protesters' concerns.
"It made the University pay serious
attention to the undergraduate curricu
lum in terms of ethnicity and race," Ca
marillo said. "In the end it was more
than just Chicano Studies. It really ad
dressed broad issues about ethnic cur
riculum at Stanford."

"It probably would have taken sev
eral more years for the University to for
mally recognize ethnic studies in many
areas across the board without that
prompting that the hunger strike creat
ed," he added.
Palumbo-Liu explained that he and
humanities professor Gordon Chang
M.A. '72 Ph.D. 'B7 came to Stanford in
1990 under efforts to increase faculty
diversity.
"We were hired under that reinvig
orated efforts to recruit a diverse facul
ty," Palumbo-Liu said. "There was in
creased and intensified student interest
[in diversity issues] ... There were more
faculty from different schools not
just H&S, but the medical school, the
law school."
Palumbo-Liu became one of the
founding faculty members of the
CCSRE who was present when the pro
gram was approved under Dean John
Shoven.

"We were rather late in the game in
terms of developing an ethnic studies
program here at Stanford," Palumbo-Liu
said. "Earlier programs had existed at
UCLA and Berkeley, of course, but the
fact that we started late also let us take
advantage of how other institutions had
done it."

Growth and development
Since its establishment, the pro
gram has continued to grow steadily,
and according to Student Services Coor
dinator Jaime Barajas Hernandez, the
program currently has 52 active stu
dents in one of the minors or majors.

"We started out with like two or
three students in the first year and then after
wards it was the fastest growing major at Stan
ford," Camarillo said.
The number of affiliated faculty has also
grown from the original 33 or 35 to over 140
volunteers. Saldivar himself came to Stanford
under the CCSRE's Faculty Diversity Initia
tive, which aims to recruit top scholars in
their fields to teach courses specifically
through the CCSRE.
In terms of growth, Saldivar explained
that the program will graduate its third cohort
of honors students through the Bing Eionor
College this year.
Palumbo-Liu spoke about how CSRE has
also seen a shift in the themes over time, as
more students have become interested in top
ics such as feminism and sexuality. The center
is also working to develop stronger connec
tions with Stanford's other schools like the
Law School and the School of Medicine.

"There is some talk of starting a graduate
program, but that's at the very early stages of
conceptualization," Palumbo-Liu said. "I think
right now we are putting a lot of energy be
hind community-based learning and [our part
nership with] the Institute for Diversity in the
Arts."

Focusing on international expansion and
community engagement, the CCSRE also re
ceived a grant to hire its first director of serv
ice learning, Nadia De Leon. Palumbo-Liu ex
plained that the center hopes the program will
continue to grow and gain more recognition.
"For the people who are involved in
teaching for CSRE, we say it's one of the most
enjoyable aspects of teaching at Stanford,"
Palumbo-Liu said. "Not just in terms of the
topic, but for the colleagues that we meet and
also the students are fabulous we're a big
happy community."

cluster of their own or else adapt one
that we already have intersectional,
public health, migrations, sexuality,"
Palumbo-Liu said.

Since the program is interdepart
mental, all affiliated faculty members
are volunteers and come from several
different departments on campus. The
CCSRE encompasses two major compo
nents: research and the undergraduate
study program.
"It's a volunteer interdepartmental
program," Palumbo-Liu said. "We're
here because we want to invest a certain
amount of our time sustaining the pro
gram, and it's been sustained now for a
good long time."

How it began
Despite being approved shortly
after the protests in November 1996,
the CSRE program had origins well be
fore the 1994 hunger strike.
Palumbo-Liu spoke about the Uni
versity Committee on Minority Issues
(UCMI), which compiled a commission
in 1989 that contained extensive re
search on minority issues on campus.
He explained that although the commis
sion was looked over, the issues were
not directly addressed. The committee
was chaired by Albert Camarillo, profes
sor of American History and the found
ing director of the CCSRE.
However, Camarillo emphasized
the importance of discussions about
race and ethnicity rather than the UCMI
in the development of the CCSRE. Ac
cording to Camarillo, before the CSRE
program, a group of faculty from the hu
manities and social science departments
received a two-year grant to hold semi
nars around the topics in 1992 or 1993.
Just as faculty began considering
the development of a research center,
protests around the issues surrounding
ethnicity began to heat up, and the firing
of University administrator Cecilia Bur
ciaga sparked the 1994 hunger strike.
The strikers' demands included a re
quest for a Chicano studies program,

and after the protests, several University
committees were established to address
the protesters' concerns.
"It made the University pay serious
attention to the undergraduate curricu
lum in terms of ethnicity and race," Ca
marillo said. "In the end it was more
than just Chicano Studies. It really ad
dressed broad issues about ethnic cur
riculum at Stanford."

"It probably would have taken sev
eral more years for the University to for
mally recognize ethnic studies in many
areas across the board without that
prompting that the hunger strike creat
ed," he added.
Palumbo-Liu explained that he and
humanities professor Gordon Chang
M.A. '72 Ph.D. 'B7 came to Stanford in
1990 under efforts to increase faculty
diversity.
"We were hired under that reinvig
orated efforts to recruit a diverse facul
ty," Palumbo-Liu said. "There was in
creased and intensified student interest
[in diversity issues] ... There were more
faculty from different schools not
just H&S, but the medical school, the
law school."
Palumbo-Liu became one of the
founding faculty members of the
CCSRE who was present when the pro
gram was approved under Dean John
Shoven.

"We were rather late in the game in
terms of developing an ethnic studies
program here at Stanford," Palumbo-Liu
said. "Earlier programs had existed at
UCLA and Berkeley, of course, but the
fact that we started late also let us take
advantage of how other institutions had
done it."

Growth and development
Since its establishment, the pro
gram has continued to grow steadily,
and according to Student Services Coor
dinator Jaime Barajas Hernandez, the
program currently has 52 active stu
dents in one of the minors or majors.

"We started out with like two or
three students in the first year and then after
wards it was the fastest growing major at Stan
ford," Camarillo said.
The number of affiliated faculty has also
grown from the original 33 or 35 to over 140
volunteers. Saldivar himself came to Stanford
under the CCSRE's Faculty Diversity Initia
tive, which aims to recruit top scholars in
their fields to teach courses specifically
through the CCSRE.
In terms of growth, Saldivar explained
that the program will graduate its third cohort
of honors students through the Bing Eionor
College this year.
Palumbo-Liu spoke about how CSRE has
also seen a shift in the themes over time, as
more students have become interested in top
ics such as feminism and sexuality. The center
is also working to develop stronger connec
tions with Stanford's other schools like the
Law School and the School of Medicine.

"There is some talk of starting a graduate
program, but that's at the very early stages of
conceptualization," Palumbo-Liu said. "I think
right now we are putting a lot of energy be
hind community-based learning and [our part
nership with] the Institute for Diversity in the
Arts."

Focusing on international expansion and
community engagement, the CCSRE also re
ceived a grant to hire its first director of serv
ice learning, Nadia De Leon. Palumbo-Liu ex
plained that the center hopes the program will
continue to grow and gain more recognition.
"For the people who are involved in
teaching for CSRE, we say it's one of the most
enjoyable aspects of teaching at Stanford,"
Palumbo-Liu said. "Not just in terms of the
topic, but for the colleagues that we meet and
also the students are fabulous we're a big
happy community."

Established in 1996, shortly after
and partly in response to the hunger
strike of 1994, Stanford's undergradu
ate program in Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity (CSRE) is the fastest
growing major at the University. The
CSRE major is the largest of five offered
by the Center for Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity (CCSRE).
According to professor of compara
tive literature David Palumbo-Liu, one of
CCSRE's founding faculty members and
director of the Undergraduate Program
in CSRE, the program's flexible curricu
lum and unique focus on comparative
studies draws on average 25 to 30 new
majors each year.
The Director of the CCSRE, Jose
David Saldivar M.A. '79 Ph.D. 'B3, also
spoke about the program's growth.
"Since 1996, CSRE has probably
been the fastest-growing major in the
University," Saldivar said. "We've had
over 450 majors and minors... In June
2013, we graduated our largest under
graduate class close to 55 to 60 [stu
dents]."

An interdepartmental program
The CSRE program is an interde
partmental program that houses five dif
ferent majors: Asian American Studies,
Chicana/o-Latina/o Studies, Compara
tive Studies in Race and Ethnicity, Jew
ish Studies and Native American Stud
ies.

"One of the things that we were
adamant about was that it would com
parative," Palumbo-Liu said. "We creat
ed this umbrella CSRE under
which those programs sit, but there is
also yet another major simply called
Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnic
ity, and that's by far our most popular
major."

Palumbo-Liu also emphasized the
program's flexibility and explained that
students can design their course path
around a theme of their choice.

"Our actual requirements are not

onerous at all, but we do leave it up to
the students to either create a thematic
cluster of their own or else adapt one
that we already have intersectional,
public health, migrations, sexuality,"
Palumbo-Liu said.
