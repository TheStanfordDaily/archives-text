# FLASHBACK FRIDAY
## Similar struggles in other institutions 
### â€“ Transcribed by Andrew Vogeley 
Stanford University was not the
only institution that experienced
a hunger strike in 1994. In fact,
students at UC-Santa Barbara,
University of Colorado and UCLA
held similar protests, and all
around the same time. Below is an
article that appeared on Thursday,
May 5, 1994.

Similar struggles

The scene that greeted Stan
ford students cutting through the
Quad yesterday morning stu
dents marching, tents and banners
blocking off the center of campus
may have surprised many, but
it is not an isolated event.
Nine students at UC-Santa
Barbara will begin their ninth day
of fasting today, and a hunger
strike on the University of Col
orado campus at Boulder conclud
ed only last week. Both events, as
well as a 14-day protest at UCLA
last spring, attempted to force
recognition of Chicano/Latino is
sues.

UC-Santa Barbara protesters
are demanding a moratorium on
student-fee increases, a universi
ty-wide boycott of grapes, a doc
toral program in Chicano studies,
a community center in neighbor
ing East La Vista and 15 more Chi
cano/Latino faculty members.
The boycott, organized by
campus Chicano/Latino group El
Congreso, has blocked off the
main administrative building on
campus and garnered national at
tention from Spanish language tel
evision, according to UC-Santa
Barbara spokesperson Joan Mc-
Gridden.

A "negotiating team" of four
high-level administrators has been
meeting with students over the

past four days to end the strike,
said McGridden.

El Congreso chair Abel
Gutierrez said that after "feeling
out" students, administrators of
fered counter-proposals to meet
some of their demands, and stu
dents revised their stipulations in
later negotiations. UC-Santa Bar
bara currently has the only Chi
cano studies department in the
University of California system.
Three full-time and one half-time
faculty positions are allocated to
the program.

Another fast on the Universi
ty of Colorado campus at Boulder
ended last week when school Pres
ident Judith Albino agreed to strik
ing students' goal of an ethnic
studies department at the univer
sity. Thirty-seven students, many
of them members of the campus
chapter of MEChA a Chi
cano/Latino student group and
United Mexican-American Stu
dents, began the strike during a
rally urging the university to grant
Asst. Prof. Estevan Flores tenure.

While Albino agreed to some
of the group's demands in princi
ple, the decision on whether to
renew Flores' tenure has not yet
been made, according to universi
ty spokesperson Jeannine Malms
bury.

Ethnic studies had been "in
the works" for a while before the
strike began, Malmsbury added.
Last year's 14-day hunger
strike on the UCLA campus, in
which nine people called for a Chi
cano studies department, was per
haps the most highly publicized of
recent campus strikes.

UCLA has since established
the Cesar Chavez Center for Chi
cano Studies and named UCLA
Assoc. Dean Carlos Grijalvaas director. Grijalva
said he personally favors compromise to affect
change instead of the "extremist kind of ap
proach" represented by hunger strikes, while
admitting the strike "moved the timetable [for
the center] forward significantly."

The success of the strike was "a matter of
timing" that depended on "getting people en
gaged in the process" after the strike ended, he
said. "Without faculty support their attempts
are going to be attempts in futility."
