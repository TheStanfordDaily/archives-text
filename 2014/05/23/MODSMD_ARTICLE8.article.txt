# FLASHBACK FRIDAY
## University must stick to signed agreement 
### â€“ Transcribed by Andrew Vogeley 
The Daily published many articles regard
ing the hunger strike in 1994. Below is an edi
torial that appeared on Monday, May 9, 1994,
after the events concluded.

A delicate situation
The tents have been dismantled. The
Quad has been cleared. The fasters have eaten.
What is left now is one piece of paper that car
ries the weight of all these events of the past
few days and the enormous frustrations that
prompted them.

And while it is fortunate that the Chicano
community's hunger strike in the Quad ended
quickly and safely, their struggle now requires
vigorous follow-through by both parties to en
sure that the victory they celebrated this week
end is a lasting one.

After members of the Chicano communi
ty endured three days of hunger and rain, the
struggle has hardly begun for both the pro
testers and those protested against.
What the protest in the Quad won was an
agreement by the administration to form three
committees to investigate the strikers' de
mands.

The demands included an offer of a high
level position for Assoc. Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Cecilia Burciaga, who was recently
laid off due to budget cuts; the establishment
of a community center in East Palo Alto; a cam
pus-wide ban on grapes; and the development
of a Chicano studies program.

Committees will be formed to examine
the feasibility of the latter three demands. On
the first demand, the administration offered a
formal statement acknowledging Burciaga's
contributions to the community, but no job or
apology for the layoff.
But the written statement signed by Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper and Provost
Condoleezza Rice contains few of the concrete
details that were discussed, unlike at other
schools which are having similar strikes, Xand
essentially asks for a leap of faith, which stu
dents apparently took when they ended the
strike.

Whether the leap of faith was justified re
mains to be seen.

For this reason, it is crucial for students
and faculty who supported the protest to con-

tinue showing their support for the demands
until they are more clearly within reach, be
cause while the most generous concessions
a Chicano studies program by 1995 and a com
munity center in East Palo Alto were dis
cussed, they were not documented in specific
details on paper.
Administrators, for their part, must realize
that the situation is still delicate. It will take a
long series of positive steps to build a comfort
able relationship of mutual trust and respect.
Though the vaguely worded document
may not hold them accountable to the specifics
discussed in the negotiations, the administra
tion must realize that developing this trust and
respect largely rests on their following through
on these specifics. Straying too far from what's
not on paper could be as detrimental to the re
lationship as simply reneging on a part of the
written document.

After all, this is much of what the strike
was about trust and respect, or the per
ceived lack thereof. Committees to examine
the issue of grapes and the others could likely
have been formed through different channels,
though perhaps not as rapidly. The strike, how
ever, was also away to mobilize the communi
ty, express deeply rooted frustrations and point
out the urgency of the situation in away that
face-to-face board room meetings probably
could not.

And though there may not be a hunger
strike to rally around or respond to any more,
both parties need to understand that their indi
vidual efforts must continue as convincingly as
ever. Because beyond the rhetoric of desperate
situations must lie actions that will endure.
