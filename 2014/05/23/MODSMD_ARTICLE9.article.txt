pus, Finn was a well-recognized member of

Klein. "Sometimes we would get a phone call
from a dorm and then 10 minutes later he
would be back at our house."

According to Klein, Finn has been seen in
dormitories throughout Escondido Road in
cluding Lantana, Branner, Kimball and
Crothers. However, the adventurous cat has
also been seen in Pi Phi, Munger, Roble and
White Plaza, and has even been picked up by
one of the Hennessys.
"We tried to keep him in the house some
times, but he just wouldn't have it," Klein said.
"If he wasn't let out, he would just pee all over
things in the house. If we let him out, he would
go and then he'd come back. And sometimes
he would go for an extended time if he found
somebody who was feeding him. Not long ago
he came back smelling like perfume. We want
ed to put a GoPro camera on him or at least a
GPS real-time tracking device."
News of Finn's death spread quickly on
campus, with many students reaching out
with condolences to the family.
"It's been an incredible outpouring of
support on Facebook and on the RF email list,"
Klein said. "People have been at the door and
saying how much he meant to them. It's been
amazing. It's hard and sad, but we're also re
membering the adorable and funny things he
did. We're imagining that he's off to his next
adventure. Any creatures people or ani
mals that we know that were out for an ad
venture, it was him."
Klein and Michelle Darby plan to have a
memorial service for Finn. The date has yet to
be determined.
