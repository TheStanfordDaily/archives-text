After doing all it could in the
second half to make its case for
the postseason, Stanford baseball
saw its efforts come to fruition on
Monday morning when it heard
its name called by the NCAA se
lection committee. The Cardinal
will be headed to an NCAA Re
gional for the fourth time in five
years and for the 29th time in pro
gram history, clinching a ticket to
the Bloomington, Indiana Re
gional as the No. 3 seed in a quar
tet that features host and fourth
overall seed Indiana.
In order to make that happen,
the Cardinal (30-23,16-14 Pac-12)
finished the regular season
strong with a sweep of the last
place Utah Utes (16-36,4-26 Pac

loss to San Jose State two weeks

postseason; you can't do more
than a sweep, so it was good."

Cardinal needed to get their of

Utes pitching staff that carried an
ugly 5.05 ERA. And with their
postseason hopes lying in the bal

up to the plate and delivered an
inspired offensive effort, scoring
17 runs and cranking 33 hits over
the weekend.
Spearheading that offensive
effort was sophomore right field
er Zach Hoffpauir, who continued
a stretch of excellent hitting dur
ing the second half of the season
by hitting .615 over the weekend
including a five-hit perform
ance on Friday and driving in
six runs. In doing so, he raised his
season average to .339 second
best on the team behind junior
center fielder Austin Slater.
"[Hoffpauir] has really been
swinging it," said Marquess after
the team's win on Sunday. "He got
five hits on Friday and then got
the big hit today that won the
game for us, and he's played phe
