### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
After doing all it could in the
second half to make its case for
the postseason, Stanford baseball
saw its efforts come to fruition on
Monday morning when it heard
its name called by the NCAA se
lection committee. The Cardinal
will be headed to an NCAA Re
gional for the fourth time in five
years and for the 29th time in pro
gram history, clinching a ticket to
the Bloomington, Indiana Re
gional as the No. 3 seed in a quar
tet that features host and fourth
overall seed Indiana.
In order to make that happen,
the Cardinal (30-23,16-14 Pac-12)
finished the regular season
strong with a sweep of the last
place Utah Utes (16-36,4-26 Pac
-12), remaining on the NCAA
Tournament bubble after suffer
ing a setback with its midweek
loss to San Jose State two weeks
ago.
"We can't do more than what
we did," said head coach Mark
Marquess. "We got ourselves in
position to hopefully go to the
postseason; you can't do more
than a sweep, so it was good."
Heading into the weekend, the
Cardinal needed to get their of
fense going against a beleaguered
Utes pitching staff that carried an
ugly 5.05 ERA. And with their
postseason hopes lying in the bal
ance, the Cardinal hitters stepped
up to the plate and delivered an
inspired offensive effort, scoring
17 runs and cranking 33 hits over
the weekend.
Spearheading that offensive
effort was sophomore right field
er Zach Hoffpauir, who continued
a stretch of excellent hitting dur
ing the second half of the season
by hitting .615 over the weekend
including a five-hit perform
ance on Friday and driving in
six runs. In doing so, he raised his
season average to .339 second
best on the team behind junior
center fielder Austin Slater.
"[Hoffpauir] has really been
swinging it," said Marquess after
the team's win on Sunday. "He got
five hits on Friday and then got
the big hit today that won the
game for us, and he's played phe
nomenally for the last five or six
weeks."
That five-hit outburst for Hoff
pauir on Friday contributed to a
strong offensive rally in which the
Cardinal knocked 15 hits, a season
high. The Card also benefitted from
a splendid outing from staff ace and
freshman righty Cal Quantrill, who
dipped his ERA to 2.92 by giving the
team eight strong innings of
shutout, four-hit ball.
In just the latest in a string of
stellar outings, the Canadian dis
played exceptional control as he
struck out a career-high 10 batters
for his second straight start and
walked just two. He threw 120
pitches but only ran into trouble
once when he loaded the bases in the
7th before throwing a three-pitch
strikeout to get out of the jam.
Following Quantrill's gem, the
second game of the three-game se
ries was delayed due to rain, forcing
a doubleheader on Sunday. But the

inclement weather did nothing to
disrupt the Cardinal's rhythm.
Junior southpaw John Hochstat
ter took the hill for the first game of
the doubleheader seeking his 10th
win of the season and managed to
earn just the third 10-win season in
Stanford history despite a shaky
outing.

While the lefty went just six in
nings and gave up five earned runs,
Stanford's offense didn't lose pace
and gave him more than enough
support. In a three-run third inning,
the Cardinal used back-to-back
RBI singles from freshman second
baseman Tommy Edman and senior
first baseman Danny Diekroeger
and a sacrifice fly from junior center
fielder Austin Slater to pull ahead.
And in the seventh inning, facing
a one-run deficit, it was again Hoff
pauir that provided the spark for
the Cardinal offense.
After Slater reached on an error

that scored a run and tied the game,
Hoffpauir came up to the plate with
men on first and second. With the
green light to swing on a 3-0 count,
Hoffpauir drilled the fastball deep
to left, and although the ball initial
ly appeared to leave the ballpark, it
was ruled to be in play after taking a
tough bounce and the sophomore
never broke stride on his 360-foot
journey around the diamond, slid
ing headfirst into home with the
first inside-the-park home run of his
career to give Stanford a three-run
lead.
From there, it was just mop-up
duty for senior right-hander A.J.
Vanegas, who put the cap on what
could have been his final game in a
Stanford uniform with a three-in
ning save.
While the second game of the
doubleheader saw the offense take a
step back, sophomore lefty Logan
James took control and made it a

non-issue, tossing 111 pitches in a
gutsy 7.2-inning effort in which he
gave up just two runs and struck out
five. It was the third consecutive
start in which James pitched at least
seven innings, and opened the gate
for sophomore righty Marcus
Brakeman to contribute yet another
solid relief outing to end the regular
season on a high note for the Cardi
nal.
And after the series he'd had to
that point, who better than Hoff
pauir to give the Cardinal offense
the spark in the regular-season fi
nale? After Slater put the Cardinal
on the board with an RBI double,
Hoffpauir laid the hammer down
with a deep homer to left this
time, of the conventional variety
to give the Cardinal the lead that
they would never relinquish.
Looking ahead to the NCAA Re
gional, the Cardinal will first face off
against second-seeded Indiana

State (35-16, 14-7 Missouri Valley),
which finished second in the MVC to
earn an at-large bid. Aside from Big
Ten champion Indiana (42-13-1,21-3
Big Ten), the Cardinal's bracket
also features fourth-seeded
Youngstown State, which automati
cally made the cut as the Horizon
League champions despite its 16-36
overall record.
Stanford will kick off its latest
postseason run on Friday in the
first-to-three-wins, double-elimina
tion regional against the
Sycamores, Hoosiers and Penguins
with the winner advancing to the
Super Regional to face the winner of
the Nashville Regional, which fea
tures Vanderbilt, Xavier, Clemson
and Oregon.
In order to qualify, the Cardinal
had a strong second half after a
mediocre first half to their regular
season, finishing 19-7 in their last 26
games, including series wins in each
of its final four weekends, to become
the fifth and final team in the Pac-12
to be named to the field of 64 teams.
Stanford joins top overall seed Ore
gon State, Oregon, Arizona State
and Washington as qualifiers from
its conference.
In their last qualification for the
NCAA Tournament, the Cardinal
were the No. 1 seed in their region
al and qualified for the Super Re
gional with three wins over Fresno
State and Pepperdine before suffer
ing a combined 35-8 drubbing at the
hands of third overall seed Florida
State.
Stanford has not played any of
the teams in its regional since 1959.
The Cardinal will kick off post
season play at 11 a.m. against Indi
ana State in Bloomington, with the
winner of the game moving on to
face the winner of the 4 p.m. Indi
ana-Youngstown State matchup and
the loser going on to face its losing
counterpart.

Sophomore outfielder Zach Hoffpauir (above) swung a hot bat last week, going 9-for-17 with four extra-base hits over the team's last four games,
all wins for Stanford. For his efforts, Hoffpauir, also a safety on the football team, was awarded the Pac-12's Player of the Week award.
