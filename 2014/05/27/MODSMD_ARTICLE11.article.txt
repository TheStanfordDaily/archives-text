# Early ouster in Athens
## Ahn, Zhao fall in singles, doubles 
### FIONA NOONAN STAFF WRITER 
The season came to a disap
pointing end for the No. 11 Stan
ford women's tennis team (20-3,8-
2 Pac-12) on Friday as senior
Kristie Ahn and freshman Carol
Zhao ended their runs in the
NCAA Division I Women's Tennis
Tournament.

The losses came for Ahn and
Zhao in the both the doubles and
singles rounds of 16, a surprisingly
early finish for two of the Cardi
nal's strongest players.
After Stanford cruised through
the opening round of the individual
tournament, sending all of their
lineup but junior Ellen Tsay onto
the second round, the outlook
looked good for the squad. All five
players had momentum from the
Card's semifinal finish in the team
tournament, and each had a domi
nant opening individual perform
ance. When the round of 32 con
cluded in Athens, Georgia on
Thursday, however, only Ahn and
Zhao remained standing.

The No. 10 doubles duo of Ahn
and Zhao was also a force to be
reckoned with all season, and was
consistently among the top 10
pairs in the country finishing
second in the Pac-12 doubles tour
nament in April.
Coming into Friday's match
against No. 8 Monique Albu
querque and Clementina Riobueno
of Miami, Stanford's lone doubles
pair had an impressive 29-5 record.
Ahn and Zhao started off strong in
the first set, but quickly let the lead
slip away as Albuquerque and Ri
obueno went ahead 6-4. In typical
fashion, the Cardinal's pair fought
back and rallied late in the second
set, but fell short, losing 7-5 to give
the Hurricane duo the win.

On the singles side, expecta
tions were high for No. 21 Zhao, a
freshman who was recently named
the ITA Northwest Region Player
to Watch. She spent the year at
number three for the Cardinal,
consistently exceeding expecta
tions and taking 27 of her 30
matches in straight sets.
On Thursday, she pulled off a
huge upset victory over host Geor
gia's No. 6 Lauren Herring, con
tinuing her pattern of steady per
formances in high-pressure situa
tions. The 7-6 (4), 7-5 win should

have been a nice boost going into
the round of 16, but failed to pro
vide the necessary momentum to
push Zhao to the quarterfinals.
Zhao hit a roadblock against
UCLA's No. 13 Chanelle Van
Nguyen, a familiar Pac-12 oppo
nent. The Bruins junior took Zhao
down 7-5, 6-2 in an extremely rare
straight-set loss for the freshman.
After UCLA's powerhouse players
Jennifer Brady and Robin Ander
son also fell in the round of 16, Van
Nguyen's victory became doubly
important for the national team
champion Bruins.
However, the story of the day
was No. 3 senior Kristie Ahn, who
faced Georgia State's No. 22 Abigail
Tere-Apisah. Ahn, too, had a good
round of 32 showing against UCLAs
No. 38 Kyle McPhillips, but could not
repeat her success on Friday.
Ahn, whose Stanford career be
fore this year was riddled with in
juries, fell victim once again during
the second set of the match. Tere-
Apisah took the first set 6-3, and
after falling behind 1-0 in the sec
ond set, Ahn was forced to stop the
match early due to injury.
It was a perhaps unfair end to a
career that saw Ahn post a 97-17
overall record and clinch the na
tional championship match against
Texas A&M during last year's

NCAA Tournament. She was
named the ITA National Senior
Player of the Year after finishing
29-5. Incredibly, the senior never
dropped consecutive matches dur
ing her time on the Farm.
Ultimately, neither Tere-
Apisah nor Van Nguyen made it to
the championship match, which
took place Monday between Cal's
No. 24 Lynn Chi and UVA's No. 38
Danielle Collins.

For the Cardinal, despite a pre
mature end to the individual tour
nament run, the team's success in
Athens remains significant. The
round of 16 finishes by Ahn and
Zhao automatically earned them
Ail-American status, and the pair
will earn the same honor for dou
bles if they finish ranked in the
ITA'stop 10.
As for the rest of this young
Stanford squad, there is nowhere
to go but up. The roster will look al
most identical next season, and the
country's most decorated program
will continue to build under head
coach Lele Forood.
Especially after not winning
any championship titles this sea
son, the hunger will be even
greater come 2015.

the second round, the outlook
looked good for the squad. All five
players had momentum from the
Card's semifinal finish in the team
tournament, and each had a domi
nant opening individual perform
ance. When the round of 32 con
cluded in Athens, Georgia on
Thursday, however, only Ahn and
Zhao remained standing.

The No. 10 doubles duo of Ahn
and Zhao was also a force to be
reckoned with all season, and was
consistently among the top 10
pairs in the country finishing
second in the Pac-12 doubles tour
nament in April.
Coming into Friday's match
against No. 8 Monique Albu
querque and Clementina Riobueno
of Miami, Stanford's lone doubles
pair had an impressive 29-5 record.
Ahn and Zhao started off strong in
the first set, but quickly let the lead
slip away as Albuquerque and Ri
obueno went ahead 6-4. In typical
fashion, the Cardinal's pair fought
back and rallied late in the second
set, but fell short, losing 7-5 to give
the Hurricane duo the win.

On the singles side, expecta
tions were high for No. 21 Zhao, a
freshman who was recently named
the ITA Northwest Region Player
to Watch. She spent the year at
number three for the Cardinal,
consistently exceeding expecta
tions and taking 27 of her 30
matches in straight sets.
On Thursday, she pulled off a
huge upset victory over host Geor
gia's No. 6 Lauren Herring, con
tinuing her pattern of steady per
formances in high-pressure situa
tions. The 7-6 (4), 7-5 win should

have been a nice boost going into
the round of 16, but failed to pro
vide the necessary momentum to
push Zhao to the quarterfinals.
Zhao hit a roadblock against
UCLA's No. 13 Chanelle Van
Nguyen, a familiar Pac-12 oppo
nent. The Bruins junior took Zhao
down 7-5, 6-2 in an extremely rare
straight-set loss for the freshman.
After UCLA's powerhouse players
Jennifer Brady and Robin Ander
son also fell in the round of 16, Van
Nguyen's victory became doubly
important for the national team
champion Bruins.
However, the story of the day
was No. 3 senior Kristie Ahn, who
faced Georgia State's No. 22 Abigail
Tere-Apisah. Ahn, too, had a good
round of 32 showing against UCLAs
No. 38 Kyle McPhillips, but could not
repeat her success on Friday.
Ahn, whose Stanford career be
fore this year was riddled with in
juries, fell victim once again during
the second set of the match. Tere-
Apisah took the first set 6-3, and
after falling behind 1-0 in the sec
ond set, Ahn was forced to stop the
match early due to injury.
It was a perhaps unfair end to a
career that saw Ahn post a 97-17
overall record and clinch the na
tional championship match against
Texas A&M during last year's

NCAA Tournament. She was
named the ITA National Senior
Player of the Year after finishing
29-5. Incredibly, the senior never
dropped consecutive matches dur
ing her time on the Farm.
Ultimately, neither Tere-
Apisah nor Van Nguyen made it to
the championship match, which
took place Monday between Cal's
No. 24 Lynn Chi and UVA's No. 38
Danielle Collins.

For the Cardinal, despite a pre
mature end to the individual tour
nament run, the team's success in
Athens remains significant. The
round of 16 finishes by Ahn and
Zhao automatically earned them
Ail-American status, and the pair
will earn the same honor for dou
bles if they finish ranked in the
ITA'stop 10.
As for the rest of this young
Stanford squad, there is nowhere
to go but up. The roster will look al
most identical next season, and the
country's most decorated program
will continue to build under head
coach Lele Forood.
Especially after not winning
any championship titles this sea
son, the hunger will be even
greater come 2015.

After dealing with injuries for much of her collegiate career, senior
Kristie Ahn (above) was forced to retire in her round of 16 match
against Georgia State's Abigail Tere-Ansipah while trailing 6-3, 1-0.
The season came to a disap
pointing end for the No. 11 Stan
ford women's tennis team (20-3,8-
2 Pac-12) on Friday as senior
Kristie Ahn and freshman Carol
Zhao ended their runs in the
NCAA Division I Women's Tennis
Tournament.

The losses came for Ahn and
Zhao in the both the doubles and
singles rounds of 16, a surprisingly
early finish for two of the Cardi
nal's strongest players.
After Stanford cruised through
the opening round of the individual
tournament, sending all of their
lineup but junior Ellen Tsay onto
the second round, the outlook

tournament, and each had a domi
