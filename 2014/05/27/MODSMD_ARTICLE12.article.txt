"Perfection."
We don't talk about perfection
much because this is Stanford, and
we don't want to seem conceited and
obnoxious. But the idea of perfection
haunts us. We've continually strived
for it â€”2400 on the SAT, 4.0 GPA,
starting on the varsity team, admis
sion to Stanford.
Pushing for perfection is what
got us here and we aren't about to
abandon the quest. The adrenaline
rush of getting an "A" in a class, the
honor of being elected president of
your club, the triumph of landing the
perfect internship or getting into the
best lab, all push us forward. We
aren't satisfied, however, with being
the perfect student. We strive to be
the perfect girlfriend, boyfriend,
daughter or son. We strive for perfect
bodies because this is California, with
shorts weather all year round. We
strive to take as many classes as pos
sible because there are too many
amazing classes to cram into four
short years. We don't say it out loud,
but we still want to be perfect.

Not surprisingly, then, there's
been a lot of talk about "Duck Syn
drome" and mental health around
campus recently. CAPS, the Bridge
and PHEs all want us to acknowl
edge our stress, tell each other about
it, stop pretending to glide when we
are on the verge of drowning. Rec
ognizing the issue is important and
valuable, but I'm guessing it hasn't
led many of us to drop a class or club,
or even to skip any parties or cancel
any lunches. And recognizing that
there's stress doesn't mean that
we're doing anything about the
stressor: our obsession with being
perfect.
More and more studies show the
damage that chronic stress has on
our bodies and minds. We must pro
tect our current and future selves by
deciding what we can actually han
dle. Dealing with stress healthily is
crucial.
I'm as susceptible this desire to
be perfect as much as the next per
son. I want to take every amazing
class, join every interesting club,
make countless lifetime friends,
have an ideal romantic relationship
and maintain a perfect GPA. Isn't
that what everyone else here is
doing? But this is where there is
something to be learned from my
atypical life experience.
I try to be perfect, but I've had to
change my definition of perfection.
In sixth grade I became mysteri
ously ill. Years later, I was diagnosed
with Postural Orthostatic Tachycar
dia Syndrome (POTS) a neuro
logical disorder of the autonomic
nervous system. This disorder is
complicated, rare and confusing but
basically leaves me with a compro
mised immune system, little energy
and constant pain. Getting through
high school was almost physically
impossible. By choosing to come
here rather than a less challenging
school, I signed up for more physical
pain and stress.
But I'm here. Why? Because I'm
a perfectionist who loves learning
and refuses to let my illness make
me any less than what I would have
been if healthy. I refuse to be a less
er person, but I am most definitely a
different person. I can't take twenty
units I work hard to manage ten. I
can't join six clubs I push myself to
participate in three. I can't have thirty
"best friends" whom I see constantly
I push to keep up with the dozen or
so I have. I can't study until two in the
morning the night before a midterm,
or any night for that matter.

I've had to find a new definition of
perfection, to redefine what perfect
means for me and not anyone else.
"Perfect" for me means getting my
work done to the best of my ability in
those classes that I can take. "Per
fect" means joining low key clubs
that tolerate my frequent absences.
"Perfect" means finding a smaller
group of friends who understand
why I sometimes cancel at the last
minute.
This is my perfection. It isn't
yours, nor should it be. What I urge,
though, based upon my own experi
ence, is that we each assess realisti
cally how much we can handle with
out sacrificing our health. Some
amount of stress is necessary for
achievement, but something is out of

whack when the University adminis
tration struggles to stem an epidem
ic of stress-related suffering. We
don't have to live like this. We can
choose to create a balanced life. Tak
ing a night off isn't being lazy. Stay
ing in to watch a movie or read a
book doesn't mean that you're anti
social. Taking a reasonable class
load isn't weak. If we want mental
health to improve on campus we
must change both our collective and
personal definitions of "perfection."
My life has forced me to make the
changes; your life may be better if
you take a deep breath and learn to
allow yourself a bit of slack while
pursuing perfection.
