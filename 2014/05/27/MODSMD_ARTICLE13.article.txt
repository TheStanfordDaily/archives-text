## Autism, allyship and Autism Speaks 
### Erika Lynn Abigail Kreeger 
How would you feel if you were
told on a national platform,
by the co-founder of a sup
posed advocacy group working on
your behalf, that you were lost?
That you, and three million other
people like you, were stolen from
your family, your friends, and your
community?
According to Suzanne Wright, co
founder of Autism Speaks the
most prominent and well-known
autism advocacy group in America
I am lost. I am not living. My fam
ily is not living, either. They just
exist, trying to deal with the burden
that I am. Trying to deal with my dif
ficulties with non-literal language.
Trying to deal with my difficulties
with abrupt change, unfamiliarity
and the unplanned. Trying to deal
with my constant fidgets and my sen
sory differences.
Last November, before the
Autism Speaks' first ever National
Policy and Action Summit in D.C,
Suzanne published an essay on
Autism Speaks' website about the
"autism crisis."
"If three million children in
America one day went missing
what would we as a country
do?[...]We would call out the
[military... ]Yet we've for the
most part lost touch with three
million American children
[with autismJ, and as a nation
ive've done nothing."
In case it wasn't clear, I greatly
dislike and disagree with Autism
Speaks in part because their
fundraising budget is more than five

times their family service grant
budget (4 percent vs. 22 percent),
and in part because their views to
wards Autistics are infantilizing: it's
not three million Autistic kids; it's
three million Autistic people. I dis
like and disagree with them in part
because they have no (open) Autistic
representation on any senior or advi
sory board. The one Autistic person
that they hired for an advisory board
resigned last November, citing that
he joined in 2010 in the hopes the he
could reform the organization, but
that with the publication of
Suzanne's piece, he realized that
Autism Speaks has not changed
and will not change.
And that gets to one of my
biggest problems with Autism
Speaks. They don't listen, and they
don't change. And they sure don't
speak for Autistics. After years of
outcry from Autistics demanding re
spect, change and that more than 2
percent of their research budget be
spent on understanding the needs of
and services for Autistics, they are
still the same organization that views
me as diseased, disordered and a
burden to society.
Recently at Stanford, a new stu
dent group has been formed, Autism
Speaks U, the university-level or
ganization of Autism Speaks. Across
the country, the chapters of this or
ganization sponsor Walk for Autism,
Light it Up Blue and other cam
paigns that many, if not, most, Autis
tics do not support. While their in
tentions are good, the dialogue that
these campus organizations creates

is centered on awareness of the prob
lems we are seen as, not acceptance
of the people non-Autistics far too
often forget us to be.
If you want to be or consider
yourself an Autistic ally, I urge you
not to support Autism Speaks or the
Stanford chapter of Autism Speaks
U. Rather, look for organizations to
support that are run by Autistics and
for Autistics, like the Autistic Self
Advocacy Network, the Autism
Women's Network, The Thinking
Person's Guide to Autism and the
Autism National Committee. The
work they do supports Autistics,
their families and communities.

There are also many other infor
mal ways you can be an ally to Autis
tics. First off, educate yourself about
who we are, our diversity and our col
lective goals and desires. Come to
see us as a varied community of func
tional, competent people.
Call us Autistic (identity-first lan
guage). I'm not a person with trans
genderness. I'm a transwoman. Sim
ilarly, I'm not a "person with autism."
I'm an Autistic. (Note: Some folks do
prefer to be called person with
autism, in which case, you should
refer to them as such.)
It's also important to understand
that most Autistics do not want a
cure, because most of us don't believe
that autism is a disease or a disorder.
Nothing is wrong or broken with us.
Our brains just function differently
than those of others. We process the
world around us differently. Some
times it is a wonderful gift. Other
times, it's quite disabling. But it is

not something that needs fixing or
changing. What we need is accept
ance and understanding.
Going into more detail about
some of our neurological differences,
most Autistics experience and sense
the world very differently from neu
rotypicals (non-Autistics). For exam
ple, it is dangerously difficult for me
to feel cold. Light touch can be very
overwhelming for me, and I'm very
sensitive to color and light. Most
Autistics also have difficulty in large,
crowded and loud situations and
events. Having sensory-free (or as
sensory-free as possible) spaces at
parties, events and other large gath
erings for Autistics to decompress
and regulate themselves can make
Autistics feel much safer and more
comfortable in social situations.

Another important thing to do is
to listen to us, assume our compe
tence and take us seriously. If we ask
for an accommodation of some kind,
it's because we need it. Likewise, if
we give you feedback or a suggestion
on how to make a space more acces
sible for Autistics, listen and engage
seriously.
Keep these simple, easy ways of
being an Autistic ally in your mind at
all times, especially if you are planning
an event or social gathering. Don't be
like Autism Speaks and ignore and
denigrate us. Listen to us, respect us
and take our needs seriously.

ive've done nothing."
In case it wasn't clear, I greatly
dislike and disagree with Autism
Speaks in part because their
fundraising budget is more than five

times their family service grant
budget (4 percent vs. 22 percent),
and in part because their views to
wards Autistics are infantilizing: it's
not three million Autistic kids; it's
three million Autistic people. I dis
like and disagree with them in part
because they have no (open) Autistic
representation on any senior or advi
sory board. The one Autistic person
that they hired for an advisory board
resigned last November, citing that
he joined in 2010 in the hopes the he
could reform the organization, but
that with the publication of
Suzanne's piece, he realized that
Autism Speaks has not changed
and will not change.
And that gets to one of my
biggest problems with Autism
Speaks. They don't listen, and they
don't change. And they sure don't
speak for Autistics. After years of
outcry from Autistics demanding re
spect, change and that more than 2
percent of their research budget be
spent on understanding the needs of
and services for Autistics, they are
still the same organization that views
me as diseased, disordered and a
burden to society.
Recently at Stanford, a new stu
dent group has been formed, Autism
Speaks U, the university-level or
ganization of Autism Speaks. Across
the country, the chapters of this or
ganization sponsor Walk for Autism,
Light it Up Blue and other cam
paigns that many, if not, most, Autis
tics do not support. While their in
tentions are good, the dialogue that
these campus organizations creates

is centered on awareness of the prob
lems we are seen as, not acceptance
of the people non-Autistics far too
often forget us to be.
If you want to be or consider
yourself an Autistic ally, I urge you
not to support Autism Speaks or the
Stanford chapter of Autism Speaks
U. Rather, look for organizations to
support that are run by Autistics and
for Autistics, like the Autistic Self
Advocacy Network, the Autism
Women's Network, The Thinking
Person's Guide to Autism and the
Autism National Committee. The
work they do supports Autistics,
their families and communities.

There are also many other infor
mal ways you can be an ally to Autis
tics. First off, educate yourself about
who we are, our diversity and our col
lective goals and desires. Come to
see us as a varied community of func
tional, competent people.
Call us Autistic (identity-first lan
guage). I'm not a person with trans
genderness. I'm a transwoman. Sim
ilarly, I'm not a "person with autism."
I'm an Autistic. (Note: Some folks do
prefer to be called person with
autism, in which case, you should
refer to them as such.)
It's also important to understand
that most Autistics do not want a
cure, because most of us don't believe
that autism is a disease or a disorder.
Nothing is wrong or broken with us.
Our brains just function differently
than those of others. We process the
world around us differently. Some
times it is a wonderful gift. Other
times, it's quite disabling. But it is

not something that needs fixing or
changing. What we need is accept
ance and understanding.
Going into more detail about
some of our neurological differences,
most Autistics experience and sense
the world very differently from neu
rotypicals (non-Autistics). For exam
ple, it is dangerously difficult for me
to feel cold. Light touch can be very
overwhelming for me, and I'm very
sensitive to color and light. Most
Autistics also have difficulty in large,
crowded and loud situations and
events. Having sensory-free (or as
sensory-free as possible) spaces at
parties, events and other large gath
erings for Autistics to decompress
and regulate themselves can make
Autistics feel much safer and more
comfortable in social situations.

Another important thing to do is
to listen to us, assume our compe
tence and take us seriously. If we ask
for an accommodation of some kind,
it's because we need it. Likewise, if
we give you feedback or a suggestion
on how to make a space more acces
sible for Autistics, listen and engage
seriously.
Keep these simple, easy ways of
being an Autistic ally in your mind at
all times, especially if you are planning
an event or social gathering. Don't be
like Autism Speaks and ignore and
denigrate us. Listen to us, respect us
and take our needs seriously.

How would you feel if you were
told on a national platform,
by the co-founder of a sup
posed advocacy group working on
your behalf, that you were lost?
That you, and three million other
people like you, were stolen from
your family, your friends, and your
community?
According to Suzanne Wright, co
founder of Autism Speaks the
most prominent and well-known
autism advocacy group in America
I am lost. I am not living. My fam
ily is not living, either. They just
exist, trying to deal with the burden
that I am. Trying to deal with my dif
ficulties with non-literal language.
Trying to deal with my difficulties
with abrupt change, unfamiliarity
and the unplanned. Trying to deal
with my constant fidgets and my sen
sory differences.
Last November, before the
Autism Speaks' first ever National
Policy and Action Summit in D.C,
Suzanne published an essay on
Autism Speaks' website about the
"autism crisis."
"If three million children in
America one day went missing
what would we as a country
do?[...]We would call out the
[military... ]Yet we've for the
most part lost touch with three
million American children
[with autismJ, and as a nation
ive've done nothing."
