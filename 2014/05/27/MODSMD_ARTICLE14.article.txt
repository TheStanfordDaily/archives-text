### Francis Fukuyama 
This interview is part of The
Daily's "Ideas of an Interna
tional Order" series, running
from April 27-30, 201b, 'which
explores the potential for evolv
ing and, contrasting concepts of
an international system in the
21st, century, and what Ameri
ca can or should, do in response.

Do you believe that there are ex
isting alternatives to the world
order, as is right now?
Well, it depends a little bit by
what you mean by "world order."
Because it's different at an interna
tional and national level. I think that
the dominant form of national level
organization is some combination of
liberal democracy and a market-ori
ented economic system, and that
this has largely been true since the
1970s and particularly after the fall
of the Berlin Wall. And on an inter
national level, institutions largely
reflected the dominance of this kind
of state. The WTO and Bretton
Woods institutions and the like have
all supported a kind of liberal, glob
alized, trading order. The United
States obviously, as the largest cap
italist democracy, has been ex
tremely important in supporting
both the spread of that kind of na
tional institution and also support
ing the larger order.
Now, that's challenged by some
countries. The most important chal
lenge is China, because China has
an only partially marketized econo
my. It's an authoritarian political
system. It partakes of this liberal
order but it doesn't spend any effort
to maintain it. So there's an alterna
tive model at the national level, but
my view has been for a long time
that the China model is not a sus
tainable one in the long run. They've
done very well in the last generation
but as they try to become a high-in
come country, both political and eco
nomic sides of this model are going
to show a lot of strain.
And then on an international
level, they don't really have an alter
native other than just pursuing

their own commercial and national
self-interest. When they go into
Africa or Latin America, they don't
behave the way the European,
North American firms and govern
ments behave. But I don't think that
that's based, really, on a systematic
view of how the world ought to be
different. There are principles
you should respect national sover
eigntyâ€” but that's not really a
principle on which you can build
very much of an international struc
ture.
And the other problem is that
their interests are different from
Russia's, which are different from
Venezuela's, which are different
from Iran's. So there are a lot of peo
ple [who] are unhappy with the cur
rent world order, but they don't real
ly constitute a cohesive bloc. The
long-winded answer to your question
is, I don't really see a systematic al
ternative to the current order.
Do you think China's a kind of
heir to the Soviet Union in terms
of "of the order, but not terribly
content with it?"
No, I think that's probably not a
good analogy for a couple of rea
sons. First of all, the Soviet Union
had a universalistic ideology so they
were trying to spread their system
in Central America and sub-Saha
ran Africa. The Chinese don't care
about spreading their system.
They're primarily interested in
earning money, and that's why
they're in all of these different
places. They just don't have the kind
of imperial, messianic agenda that
the former Soviet Union did.
They've also got a much more co
herent and better economic system
than the Soviet Union did that
makes them a tougher rival.
I think, actually, the best analogy
is between the unified Germany
that merged after 1871 and China. A
lot of people made this comparison
Bismarck's Germany was not a
messianic, universalistic, revisionist
state, but it was very big and power
ful, and it had a lot of national inter

ests. And I think China's very much
like that.
You talked at the Milken [lnsti
tute Global] Conference recently,
and you discussed how the United
States could respond in a more
forceful manner to Russia.
In response to Russia, you can
easily think of stronger sanctions
that we could have imposed after
Crimea. But you've got this big
problem the Europeans don't re
ally want to go along with a lot of
them.
We still could have done more. In
my view, there are two big things
that we really ought to do. The first
is to start taking NATO seriously as
a military alliance that will defend
the existing states that are mem
bers of NATO, meaning the Baltics
in particular, Poland, other coun
tries in Eastern Europe. We have
not taken them seriously for a good
twenty years, because we assumed
the Russian threat was gone. So
that's one thing. The other thing is,
we ought to accelerate the export of
national gas. That's going to cut into
the Russians' ability to use gas as a
political weapon.
In light of that, what sort of ways
could the United States encour
age the adoption of our institu
tions on a national scale as well as
international?
It's basically two things. One is
just presenting a good model to the
world, and I think that that form of
soft power has been the dominant
way that American influence has
spread over the last two centuries.
And right now we've got some seri
ous problems: We just went through
a big financial crisis, adjustments
that need to be made to the econom
ic model, and I think we've got an
ongoing political crisis, because the
government is largely polarized and
paralyzed and unable to pass budg
ets and things of that sort. We need
to fix these domestic things.
The other things that we've done
have to do with helping to level the

playing field so that democratic
forces can express themselves. I've
been a board member of the Nation
al Endowment for Democracy for
twelve, thirteen years or so and this
has been one of the premier organi
zations that gives support to [the]
civil society organizations, women's
groups, labor movements [and] en
vironmental groups that constitute
civil society, that in many countries
are suppressed or really don't have
access to any kind of political power.
And so I think we should continue
doing that sort of thing. But we
shouldn't have a lot of illusions that
we have all that much control over
this process.
Do you believe that the measures
you've proposed in the response to
the previous questions are things
that the U.S. will be politically
able to do?
It's hard to answer that in gener
al. I don't believe that there's any
economic constraint. The budget
deficit is a big problem but we're ei
ther going to fix it by fixing entitle
ments or not, and we're not going to
fix it by failing to open an embassy
somewhere.
The question more is of the do
mestic mood, and I think clearly
Obama's relative passivity reflects
the national mood. So we've just
gone through these big Middle
Eastern wars, we're tired of that,
and tired of getting involved in
other people's affairs, and so it's just
like after Vietnam, a period of re
treat. But I have always believed
that in foreign policy leadership
matters a lot, and so you can con
vince Americans to do more but you
have to make the arguments in
favor of that. Obama hasn't been
willing to do that.
There are a lot of things that we
could have done in Libya and Syria
and Egypt that wouldn't have been
necessarily decisive but could have
made an important difference. It
wouldn't have been costly. I think
you easily could have gotten
the American people to go
along with a number of them.
So I do think that we have
more choice in this matter
than some people think.

One last question. Do you
believe that the "End of
History" thesis has been
fundamentally misunder
stood by a lot of people?
This is the 25th anniver
sary of the original article.
I've actually written a retro
spective piece that will be
published by The Wall Street
Journal at some point over
the summer. So I've been

thinking about this a lot. But
it's certainly been misunder
stood. People don't under
stand that "history" was
meant in this Marxist-
Hegelian sense of modern
ization, basically of evolu
tionary process and human
societies. And the "end of his
tory" is of where is that
modernization process
leading? Does it lead to
communism, as the Marxists
thought, or does it lead to lib
eral democracy and some
form of market economy, and
that was my argument. And I
still think that that's basical
ly right, if you understand
the argument in that sense. I
think that's right.
I actually think that al
though 2014 has so far not
been a great year, with
China and Russia both push
ing a territorial agenda,
overall, we have made a lot of
progress towards democra
cy, because we've gone from
about 35 to about 120 coun
tries around the world having
some form of electoral
democracy between 1970 and
the present. I do think it is
still the dominant form of po
litical organization.
