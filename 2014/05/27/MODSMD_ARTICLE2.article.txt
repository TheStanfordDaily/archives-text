# STUDENT LIFE
## FroSoCo offers dorm seminars

As the first brave volunteer, An
gela Cattani 'l7, sunk her teeth into
the sour lemon, nine other students
watched, wincing.
But the volunteer smiled and
kept eating the lemon, as though it
were candy.
So what caused the lemon to be
sweet? A miracle berry, a fruit that
contains a molecule called miraculin
that binds to receptors on the taste
buds and activates sweet receptors.
The berries were provided by
James Ousey 'l6 at a small student
run class called "The Chemistry of
Taste" that he taught at Freshman
Sophomore College's (FroSoCo)
Sophomore Fellows (SoFo) program
earlier this month.
So far this year, seven SoFo class
es have been taught on subjects
ranging from calligraphy and pod
casts to space exploration and mu
rals. The student-run classes are
about an hour long and are usually
attended by six to 15 students.
SoFos began in FroSoCo in 2001
to increase the intellectual vitality of
the community.
"This has been an exceptionally
successful year for SoFos," accord
ing to Khalil Griffin 'l5, FroSoCo
staff member and SoFo organizer.
Ninety of the 160 FroSoCo resi
dents have been involved an all
time high, which Griffin attributes to
funding, resources and the dorm's
purely academic theme.
During the "The Chemistry of
Taste" seminar, FroSoCo residents
learned why tonic water glows under
ultraviolet light and why foam in
toothpaste makes drinking orange
juice after brushing your teeth taste
bitter. Both are caused by molecules
