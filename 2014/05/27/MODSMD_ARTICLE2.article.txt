# STUDENT LIFE
## FroSoCo offers dorm seminars 
### KATHERINE CARR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the first brave volunteer, An
gela Cattani 'l7, sunk her teeth into
the sour lemon, nine other students
watched, wincing.
But the volunteer smiled and
kept eating the lemon, as though it
were candy.
So what caused the lemon to be
sweet? A miracle berry, a fruit that
contains a molecule called miraculin
that binds to receptors on the taste
buds and activates sweet receptors.
The berries were provided by
James Ousey 'l6 at a small student
run class called "The Chemistry of
Taste" that he taught at Freshman
Sophomore College's (FroSoCo)
Sophomore Fellows (SoFo) program
earlier this month.
So far this year, seven SoFo class
es have been taught on subjects
ranging from calligraphy and pod
casts to space exploration and mu
rals. The student-run classes are
about an hour long and are usually
attended by six to 15 students.
SoFos began in FroSoCo in 2001
to increase the intellectual vitality of
the community.
"This has been an exceptionally
successful year for SoFos," accord
ing to Khalil Griffin 'l5, FroSoCo
staff member and SoFo organizer.
Ninety of the 160 FroSoCo resi
dents have been involved an all
time high, which Griffin attributes to
funding, resources and the dorm's
purely academic theme.
During the "The Chemistry of
Taste" seminar, FroSoCo residents
learned why tonic water glows under
ultraviolet light and why foam in
toothpaste makes drinking orange
juice after brushing your teeth taste
bitter. Both are caused by molecules
within the water and foam
quinine makes the glow and
sodium lauryl sulfate dulls the
sweet taste receptors. The ex
periments and explanations
brought chemistry out of the
traditional classroom.
With a marker pen in one
hand, a white board in the
other and students seated on
the lounge sofas a far cry
from a lecture hall Ousey
drew molecules and explained
how they worked inside the
body. When he got to the taste
mechanism, Ousey sketched a
snake-like structure protrud
ing from a smooth, oval
shaped surface.
"This is what a taste bud
looks like," he said. The head
end of the "snake" was the
pore where the tongue inter
acts with food. The tail was
the nerve which sends the
taste signals to the brain.
Ousey combined his two
primary interests food and
chemistry for the class.
"I chose food because it's

pretty universal; everyone
eats food," Ousey said. "If you
understand the chemistry be
hind a few things, you can
apply it to your cooking meth
ods."

Ousey developed his love
for cooking when he was in
high school in Esparto, Cali
fornia, a town of just over
3,000 people offering no AP
science classes. At that time,
he weighed 205 pounds.
After Ousey was admitted
to Stanford, the thought of
college motivated him to slim
down. He started cooking nu
tritious food and developed a
health regimen, which he
keeps up today.
In college, Ousey's inter
est in chemistry was sparked
in a class he took last quarter.
Ousey combined his interest
in chemistry with his love for
Alton Brown's cooking show
"Good Eats" on the Food Net
work.
"[Brown really tries to
bring the science behind it to a
general part of the popula
tion," Ousey said.
George Fei 'l7 came for
the food but stayed for the
chemistry. Apart from the
miracle berries, Ousey's

teaching style stood out for
Fei.
"He started with the ex
ample and then explained the
chemistry behind it," Fei said.
:He flip-flopped from the way
chemistry is normally
taught."
Tebello Qhotsokoane 'l6,
who attended Ousey's SoFo

despite his primary interest
in politics, complimented how
well Ousey conveyed his
knowledge.
"I didn't expect to learn so
much chemistry," Qhot
sokoane said.
