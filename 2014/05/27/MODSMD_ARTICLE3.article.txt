# SPEAKERS & EVENTS
## Big data discussed at conference 
### ALEXIS GARDUNO STAFF WRITER 
At the School of Medicine's Big
Data in Bio Medicine Conference
last week, academic and industry
leaders came together to speak
about the role of big data analysis in
tackling unanswered questions
about world health. Speakers repre
sented a range of companies and or
ganizations including Google,
Genentech, Intel and the White
House.
"Big data" referring to the
ability to capture and process mas
sive amounts of information due to
the growth of computing technology
is a recently developed buzzword
that has been ringing in the ears of
doctors, computer scientists, policy
makers and data scientists because
of its role in driving discovery and
innovation in medicine and other
fields.
According to conference organ
izer and Associate Professor of
Medicine Euan Ashley, the confer
ence aimed to bring together
thought leaders committed to ex
tracting new knowledge from big
data —on the scale of terabytes
and petabytes to transform pa
tient diagnosis and treatment, as
well as disease prevention.
"The reach of the conference and
the reach of the biomedical data sci
ence initiative is really multi-scale in
many ways from atoms to atmos
phere," Ashley said.
This is the second year of the
conference, which featured TED-
style talks and a panel ses
sion encouraging audience
engagement with speakers.
Topics varied from big data
in healthcare and infectious
disease to computers and ar
chitecture.
One of the major topics
during the conference was
the challenge of big data min
ing in the context of patient
privacy and data protection
laws, especially in the med
ical field.
David Glazer, director of
engineering at Google, spoke
about his company's goal of
encouraging collaboration
between those that have the
technological tools and those
that need the analysis in the
life sciences.
"I don't have genomic
problems to solve; you have
genomic problems to solve,"
Glazer said. "I have tools."
Glazer also spoke to other
concerns, and audience
members expressed worries
about obstacles to this sort of
partnership, as privacy-pro
tected data is not open to
study, even when made
anonymous.
"The problem is most of
our data sits behind firewalls
ethical, legal, and cultural
firewalls," an audience mem
ber said. "We talked a lot yes
terday, today and tomorrow
about how to get it out from
behind there, but the reason
Google is so powerful is that
it works on publically avail
able information."
Glazer responded to con
cern over privacy-protected
data by pointing to the poten
tials of self-reporting data,
explaining that when the in
formation is valuable to the
population at large, he ex
pects people to opt into vol
unteering their personal
data.

Jim Davies, computer sci
ence professor from Oxford
University, argued the first
step would be to win patient
trust by creating a suitable
environment and encourag-

ing education. Davies cited a
genomics and biotechnology
company, 23andMe, which
provides DNA analysis serv
ices to customers already.
However, 23andMe was
ordered last year to stop sell
ing its kits as diagnostic
tools. During the conference,
San Francisco Chronicle sat
down with 23andMe co
founder and CEO Anne Woj
cicki, who reported that the
company is currently work
ing with the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) to de
cide on the best way of mov
ing forward. As of yet, the
company's kits are not FDA
approved.

The conference was well
attended. Beyond the 350
people that physically at
tended the conference, ap
proximately 1,000 tweets
went out during the event,
which hit an online audience
of over 617,000 people, said
Robin Daines, director of op
erations in the Stanford
Medical School dean's office,
in a statement to The Daily.
James Xie 'lO M.D. 'l4, a
fourth-year medical student,
and his classmates were un
able to get tickets due to pop
ular demand, and instead
watched the live coverage to
gether in a building adjacent
to the conference.
"It's been incredible to
see the growth and interest
in this field as someone who
studied computer science
and is now entering medi
cine," Xie said.

At the School of Medicine's Big
Data in Bio Medicine Conference
last week, academic and industry
leaders came together to speak
about the role of big data analysis in
tackling unanswered questions
about world health. Speakers repre
sented a range of companies and or
ganizations including Google,
Genentech, Intel and the White
House.
"Big data" referring to the
ability to capture and process mas
sive amounts of information due to
the growth of computing technology
is a recently developed buzzword
that has been ringing in the ears of
doctors, computer scientists, policy
makers and data scientists because
of its role in driving discovery and
innovation in medicine and other
fields.
According to conference organ
izer and Associate Professor of
Medicine Euan Ashley, the confer
ence aimed to bring together
thought leaders committed to ex
tracting new knowledge from big
data —on the scale of terabytes
and petabytes to transform pa
tient diagnosis and treatment, as
well as disease prevention.
"The reach of the conference and
the reach of the biomedical data sci
ence initiative is really multi-scale in
many ways from atoms to atmos
phere," Ashley said.
This is the second year of the
conference, which featured TED-
style talks and a panel ses
sion encouraging audience
engagement with speakers.
Topics varied from big data
in healthcare and infectious
disease to computers and ar
chitecture.
One of the major topics
during the conference was
the challenge of big data min
ing in the context of patient
privacy and data protection
laws, especially in the med
ical field.
David Glazer, director of
engineering at Google, spoke
about his company's goal of
encouraging collaboration
between those that have the
technological tools and those
that need the analysis in the
life sciences.
"I don't have genomic
problems to solve; you have
genomic problems to solve,"
Glazer said. "I have tools."
Glazer also spoke to other
concerns, and audience
members expressed worries
about obstacles to this sort of
partnership, as privacy-pro
tected data is not open to
study, even when made
anonymous.
"The problem is most of
our data sits behind firewalls
ethical, legal, and cultural
firewalls," an audience mem
ber said. "We talked a lot yes
terday, today and tomorrow
about how to get it out from
behind there, but the reason
Google is so powerful is that
it works on publically avail
able information."
Glazer responded to con
cern over privacy-protected
data by pointing to the poten
tials of self-reporting data,
explaining that when the in
formation is valuable to the
population at large, he ex
pects people to opt into vol
unteering their personal
data.

Jim Davies, computer sci
ence professor from Oxford
University, argued the first
step would be to win patient
trust by creating a suitable
environment and encourag-

ing education. Davies cited a
genomics and biotechnology
company, 23andMe, which
provides DNA analysis serv
ices to customers already.
However, 23andMe was
ordered last year to stop sell
ing its kits as diagnostic
tools. During the conference,
San Francisco Chronicle sat
down with 23andMe co
founder and CEO Anne Woj
cicki, who reported that the
company is currently work
ing with the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) to de
cide on the best way of mov
ing forward. As of yet, the
company's kits are not FDA
approved.

The conference was well
attended. Beyond the 350
people that physically at
tended the conference, ap
proximately 1,000 tweets
went out during the event,
which hit an online audience
of over 617,000 people, said
Robin Daines, director of op
erations in the Stanford
Medical School dean's office,
in a statement to The Daily.
James Xie 'lO M.D. 'l4, a
fourth-year medical student,
and his classmates were un
able to get tickets due to pop
ular demand, and instead
watched the live coverage to
gether in a building adjacent
to the conference.
"It's been incredible to
see the growth and interest
in this field as someone who
studied computer science
and is now entering medi
cine," Xie said.
