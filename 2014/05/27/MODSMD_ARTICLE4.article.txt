## WILSON WINS NCAA TITLE IN TIEBREAK 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
There are some storylines in
which, despite their best efforts,
the good guys just don't win.
Game of Thrones, The
Usual Suspects and the Coen
brothers' No Country for Old
Men are striking examples of
antagonists swooping in unex
pectedly to seize victory. If you
like that type of narrative, the
stroke play portion of the 2014
NCAA Men's Golf Champi

onships was not your kind of
drama. Because in that story,
Stanford's Cameron Wilson first
took the individual medalist hon
ors, and then promptly proceed
ed to talk about his teammates
in classic good-guy fashion.
"It's incredible, so glad I
made that putt, this is surreal,"
Wilson said immediately after
his win on the third playoff hole
against Georgia Tech's Ollie
Schniederjans. "I've got to men
tion my team first. I've got to say
how proud I am of my guys so

far. There is a lot of golf left, but
I am really happy for all of the
guys."
The usually calm and stoic
senior showed just the slightest
bit of emotion after his final
birdie putt hit the bottom of the
hole, hugging his teammates
and his coaches as they met him
on the 17th green to celebrate
the program's first individual
national title since Tiger Woods
in Chattanooga, Tennessee in
