## WILSON WINS NCAA TITLE IN TIEBREAK 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
There are some storylines in
which, despite their best efforts,
the good guys just don't win.
Game of Thrones, The
Usual Suspects and the Coen
brothers' No Country for Old
Men are striking examples of
antagonists swooping in unex
pectedly to seize victory. If you
like that type of narrative, the
stroke play portion of the 2014
NCAA Men's Golf Champi

onships was not your kind of
drama. Because in that story,
Stanford's Cameron Wilson first
took the individual medalist hon
ors, and then promptly proceed
ed to talk about his teammates
in classic good-guy fashion.
"It's incredible, so glad I
made that putt, this is surreal,"
Wilson said immediately after
his win on the third playoff hole
against Georgia Tech's Ollie
Schniederjans. "I've got to men
tion my team first. I've got to say
how proud I am of my guys so

far. There is a lot of golf left, but
I am really happy for all of the
guys."
The usually calm and stoic
senior showed just the slightest
bit of emotion after his final
birdie putt hit the bottom of the
hole, hugging his teammates
and his coaches as they met him
on the 17th green to celebrate
the program's first individual
national title since Tiger Woods
in Chattanooga, Tennessee in

Senior Cameron Wilson (above) was unable to clinch his NCAA individual title in regulation, as he recorded a bogey on the 18th hole in the final
round to force a tiebreak. However, on the third tiebreak hole, he punched in a birdie to win the trophy over Ollie Schniederjans of Georgia Tech.

1996. Those embraces and
handshakes released the ten
sion that was clearly visible in
everyone but the man walk
ing the course.
The drama began back in
regulation, when Schnieder
jans birdied the 17th hole,
moving him into a tie for the
lead with Wilson. Schnieder
jans, however, was playing
several groups in front of Wil
son, and entered the club
house at 6-under for the tour
nament with Wilson still on
the course. Stanford's lone
senior in its lineup in Kansas,
Wilson surpassed the Geor
gia Tech junior by virtue of
his own birdie on 17, lowering
his score to 7-under with one
hole to play. But his initial
iron shot on the 18th went
slightly left into the rough,
and his approach caught the
wispy fescue before rolling
into the greenside bunker.
After his chip shot went beg
ging, Wilson's par putt snuck
just right of the cup, and he
tapped in for bogey to force a
playoff.
"I was disappointed, sure,
but I hit a couple shots that I
liked on the last hole," Wilson
said of his final regulation
hole. "The tee shot I hit al
most exactly how I wanted to.
Didn't hit it that much further
left than I was hoping to. And
the second shot I did what I
meant to, and the rough
caught my club. I really didn't
stray from my plan that
much, and I didn't beat myself
up."

Not that there was much
chance to. After confirmation
that it would be just
Schniederjans and Wilson in
the playoff, the two Ben
Hogan Award finalists quick
ly strode back to the tee box
on 18, where the sudden death
frame began. This time, Wil
son's iron shot found the slop
ing fairway, while Schnieder
jans' swing found the deep
rough on the left side of the
fairway. But he was not able to
capitalize on the birdie putt
that ensued, and both men
parred the hole and moved on
to the par-3,185-yard 10th.
Wilson had played the hole

even during the three regula
tion rounds, with Schnieder
jans posting a trio of birdies
on the course's shortest hole.
If there was any time for
Schniederjans to take advan
tage, it was then and, given
his first shot, it seemed like he
would. Schniederjans landed
his tee shot within 10 feet of
the cup, while Wilson was
about twice as far out. Wilson
left his subsequent putt a few
feet short, but Schniederjans
also missed his opportunity at
the win, pushing his putt a
fraction left. All the while,
Wilson appeared unfazed and
moved from shot to shot with
his usual steely focus and pre
cision.
"The emotional strength
that he has and his mental
strength, he doesn't go
through highs and lows," said
commentator Billy Ray
Brown of Wilson. "He pos
sesses a lot of power off the
tee, but more importantly to
me, I see him playing a lot of
half shots and keeping the
flight down. And the imagina
tion he has around the greens.
He has got great touch and I
think he has a bright future
ahead of him."
That bright future was ce
mented on the third and final
playoff hole, which took place
where much of the action on
Monday occurred: the par-5,
523-yard 17th. After going for
the green in two during regu
lation, Wilson took a more
conservative approach in the
playoff, sending his drive
down the middle, with the ball
sloping slightly to the right
into the thin rough.
Schniederjans followed with
an errant tee shot that missed
wide left.

After his opponent
stroked his ball back into the
fairway, Wilson stayed safe
and fired an iron shot just
short of the green. By the
time both were on the undu
lating, Perry Maxwell-de
signed green, Schniederjans
had a 20-footer for birdie to
Wilson's eight-footer. With
Schniederjans' miss, Wilson
solemnly stood over his ball,
putting for the individual title
for third time. The shot was
straight and true, and by the
time it found the bottom of the
cup, Wilson broke out his sel
dom-used, infectious smile
and greeted his coaches and

teammates as they moved in
to congratulate their on-and
off-course leader.
"I was a little nervous, but
more than anything I was re
ally excited," Wilson told the
media after the playoff. "I was
really excited for the opportu
nity, and I made it a point to
just enjoy the day and every
thing that came with it.
"More than anything, I
was just really loving the
chance to win and loving
being here with my guys,"
Wilson continued. "Once I
knew from Coach that we
were doing well in the team
portion, I really didn't feel
that much pressure to win."
Head coach Conrad Ray
'97 put Wilson's incredible ac
complishment into great per
spective after the round, laud
ing his senior's humility and
determination.
"I think Cameron is prob
ably the most under-the
radar player here," Ray told

the media after the round.
"He's had a great year, but not
many people have been talk
ing about Cameron Wilson.
So to see him pull off a victory
today in our biggest champi
onship that we know is really
cool, for Stanford, for our pro
gram and for all the hard
work that he's put in and the
efforts that he's made over
the last four years.
"He has gotten better and
he probably doesn't want to
tell you about it because he's
worked at it. It's come with a
lot of trials and tribulations,
ups and downs. I remember
him freshman year, and to see
him where he's at sitting in
front of you is pretty cool."
Chalk up another win for
the good guys, because
Cameron Wilson the per
son and golfer is one of the
best out there.

Senior Cameron Wilson (above) was unable to clinch his NCAA individual title in regulation, as he recorded a bogey on the 18th hole in the final
round to force a tiebreak. However, on the third tiebreak hole, he punched in a birdie to win the trophy over Ollie Schniederjans of Georgia Tech.

1996. Those embraces and
handshakes released the ten
sion that was clearly visible in
everyone but the man walk
ing the course.
The drama began back in
regulation, when Schnieder
jans birdied the 17th hole,
moving him into a tie for the
lead with Wilson. Schnieder
jans, however, was playing
several groups in front of Wil
son, and entered the club
house at 6-under for the tour
nament with Wilson still on
the course. Stanford's lone
senior in its lineup in Kansas,
Wilson surpassed the Geor
gia Tech junior by virtue of
his own birdie on 17, lowering
his score to 7-under with one
hole to play. But his initial
iron shot on the 18th went
slightly left into the rough,
and his approach caught the
wispy fescue before rolling
into the greenside bunker.
After his chip shot went beg
ging, Wilson's par putt snuck
just right of the cup, and he
tapped in for bogey to force a
playoff.
"I was disappointed, sure,
but I hit a couple shots that I
liked on the last hole," Wilson
said of his final regulation
hole. "The tee shot I hit al
most exactly how I wanted to.
Didn't hit it that much further
left than I was hoping to. And
the second shot I did what I
meant to, and the rough
caught my club. I really didn't
stray from my plan that
much, and I didn't beat myself
up."

Not that there was much
chance to. After confirmation
that it would be just
Schniederjans and Wilson in
the playoff, the two Ben
Hogan Award finalists quick
ly strode back to the tee box
on 18, where the sudden death
frame began. This time, Wil
son's iron shot found the slop
ing fairway, while Schnieder
jans' swing found the deep
rough on the left side of the
fairway. But he was not able to
capitalize on the birdie putt
that ensued, and both men
parred the hole and moved on
to the par-3,185-yard 10th.
Wilson had played the hole

even during the three regula
tion rounds, with Schnieder
jans posting a trio of birdies
on the course's shortest hole.
If there was any time for
Schniederjans to take advan
tage, it was then and, given
his first shot, it seemed like he
would. Schniederjans landed
his tee shot within 10 feet of
the cup, while Wilson was
about twice as far out. Wilson
left his subsequent putt a few
feet short, but Schniederjans
also missed his opportunity at
the win, pushing his putt a
fraction left. All the while,
Wilson appeared unfazed and
moved from shot to shot with
his usual steely focus and pre
cision.
"The emotional strength
that he has and his mental
strength, he doesn't go
through highs and lows," said
commentator Billy Ray
Brown of Wilson. "He pos
sesses a lot of power off the
tee, but more importantly to
me, I see him playing a lot of
half shots and keeping the
flight down. And the imagina
tion he has around the greens.
He has got great touch and I
think he has a bright future
ahead of him."
That bright future was ce
mented on the third and final
playoff hole, which took place
where much of the action on
Monday occurred: the par-5,
523-yard 17th. After going for
the green in two during regu
lation, Wilson took a more
conservative approach in the
playoff, sending his drive
down the middle, with the ball
sloping slightly to the right
into the thin rough.
Schniederjans followed with
an errant tee shot that missed
wide left.

After his opponent
stroked his ball back into the
fairway, Wilson stayed safe
and fired an iron shot just
short of the green. By the
time both were on the undu
lating, Perry Maxwell-de
signed green, Schniederjans
had a 20-footer for birdie to
Wilson's eight-footer. With
Schniederjans' miss, Wilson
solemnly stood over his ball,
putting for the individual title
for third time. The shot was
straight and true, and by the
time it found the bottom of the
cup, Wilson broke out his sel
dom-used, infectious smile
and greeted his coaches and

teammates as they moved in
to congratulate their on-and
off-course leader.
"I was a little nervous, but
more than anything I was re
ally excited," Wilson told the
media after the playoff. "I was
really excited for the opportu
nity, and I made it a point to
just enjoy the day and every
thing that came with it.

was just really loving the

Wilson continued. "Once I

were doing well in the team
portion, I really didn't feel
that much pressure to win."
Head coach Conrad Ray
'97 put Wilson's incredible ac
complishment into great per
spective after the round, laud
ing his senior's humility and
determination.
"I think Cameron is prob
ably the most under-the

the media after the round.
"He's had a great year, but not
many people have been talk

So to see him pull off a victory

"He's had a great year, but not
many people have been talk
ing about Cameron Wilson.
So to see him pull off a victory
today in our biggest champi
onship that we know is really
cool, for Stanford, for our pro
gram and for all the hard
work that he's put in and the
efforts that he's made over
the last four years.
"He has gotten better and
he probably doesn't want to
tell you about it because he's
worked at it. It's come with a
lot of trials and tribulations,
ups and downs. I remember
him freshman year, and to see
him where he's at sitting in
front of you is pretty cool."
Chalk up another win for
the good guys, because
Cameron Wilson the per
son and golfer is one of the
best out there.
