# Seeing Garcia-Molina through a different lens
## 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
Over the last 22 years, Hector
Garcia-Molina M.S.''7s M.S. '77
Ph.D. '79 has slowly but surely
carved his niche into Stanford's
computer science department.
Perhaps best known as the for
mer research advisor to Google co
founder Sergey Brin, Garcia-Moli
na has become one of the premier
names in the fields of digital compu
tation and information technology.
He was the principal investigator
for the Stanford Digital Library
Project in the late 19905, which was
a driving factor behind the eventual
development of the Google search
engine.
That's the side that most people
see, anyway.
Garcia-Molina's extensive work
in computer science only tells half
the story. Yes, Garcia-Molina's aca
demic reputation precedes him, but
his identity is just as much gov
erned by something that started as
a casual hobby but has quickly
transformed into a passion that ri
vals his love for computer science:
photography.
When talking about photogra
phy, Garcia-Molina's eyes light up
and a wide grin spreads across his
face, leaving little doubt about his
love for the art.

"I don't normally do interviews,
but I love to talk about photogra
phy," he said earnestly.
Garcia-Molina gets just as excit
ed talking about his vast collection
oflenses, ofwhichhe "definitely has
too many," as he does talking about
his life's work; he spends his free
time capturing the essence of hu
manity as he sees it and, for hours
on end, lovingly arranging those

snapshots into slideshows that he
carefully pairs with "just the right
music" to showcase to the fullest ef
fect.
Hector Garcia-Molina is a com
puter scientist. But equally so, Hec
tor Garcia-Molina is a photogra
pher.

On any given weekend during
the Stanford sports season, it's a
safe bet that you'll see Garcia-Moli
na on the sidelines snapping photos
of the action for Stanford Athletics.
Looking at how he carries himself

and the quality of his work, it's near
ly impossible to tell that he has no
formal training in the art.
He takes after his father, who
was also a college professor in Mex
ico who took on photography as a se
rious hobby on the side. Over the
years, the elder Garcia-Molina took
thousands of photos and even pur
chased his son a camera to capture
his interest.
Though the camera certainly
helped Garcia-Molina get early ex
posure to photography, his father's
more significant contribution to his

photography career was more indi
rect, initially manifesting as a star
tling discovery on a trip home 20
years ago.
"My mother said, 'l'm cleaning
this closet, and I'm going to throw
away all of the slides that your fa
ther has. They're just gathering
dust and we haven't seen them in
years,"' Garcia-Molina recounted.
'"The projector broke, and we just
don't want them here.' This is liter
ally a closet full of 35-millimeter

Hector Garcia-Molina M.S. '75 M.S. '77 Ph.D. '79 is well known in the field of computer science;
however, he also has a strong passion for sports photography and volunteers for Stanford Athletics.
transparencies. I just said,
'Wait a minute, wait a minute;
you can't just throw these
out! Give me a second, let me
have a few of them!'"

After his mother prom
ised that she wouldn't throw
any of the shots out, Garcia-
Molina's technology-focused
mind kicked into gear and
drove him to search both
books and the web for ways in
which he could restore those
transparencies often
dusty, scratched and at times
moldy and preserve those
memories.

Although it was a com
pletely unfamiliar area and the
learning curve was steep,
months of hard work from
Garcia-Molina proved fruitful;
he was able to not only resur
rect decades of family memo
ries that he was able to share,
but also gain valuable first
hand experience working with
photos that only furthered his
interest and gave him better
technical ability in the field.

"I discovered it was lots of
fun. These pictures that I
wouldn't remember would
come to life," he said. "The ef
fect was great, because I
could improve the lighting
and cropping. My father was
very passionate but he wasn't
very good at framing and get
ting the light right. In Photo
shop, I could fix a lot of that,
and I started building up a col
lection of family photos in
much better shape."
As he developed his eye for
photography and resurrected
his father's work, he started
out with his first SLR camera
just as many amateur photog
raphers have: by messing
around with his camera to
document the growth of his
child.

"I took pictures of [my
son] and family pictures and
so on, just like any father
would take," he said. "But
only when he went off to col
lege and I had more time, I
started taking pictures of
other things."
And as incidentally as his
photography career had
started, Garcia-Molina's
sports photography career
began in just as impromptu of
a manner. One day, he bought
a new lens and was itching to
try it out, but his son wasn't
around to be his subject and
he decided to go take a walk

around Stanford to find some
thing new to document.
"For some reason, I went
around the athletic fields to
find something to photograph
and there were some soccer
players practicing," he said. "I
just stood there and took
some pictures, and I enjoyed
it. It was a challenge to get
things in focus and get the
right moment."
That initial foray into
sports photography piqued
his interest, and on his next
outing, he was in the stands of
a Stanford athletic matchup
taking photos from the
stands. It eventually became
a regular pastime of his, and
when the other volunteer pho
tographers at Stanford Ph
oto.com noticed him and invit
ed him to join them several
years later, he eagerly accept
ed the opportunity.

Not only would Garcia-
Molina have the chance to
showcase his work on a larger
stage under the banner of
Stanford Athletics, but he
would also be able to go to
whatever events he wanted
and take photos whenever he
wanted, giving him a formal
outlet for his passion. He has
since firmly established him
self as one of the most talent
ed sports photographers on
that staff.

Today, Garcia-Molina con
tinues to shoot photos for
Stanford Athletics but has

also managed to bring togeth
er the two fields that he is
most passionate about aca
demics and photography
in the form of the freshman
seminar that he teaches:
"Computers and Photogra
phy: From Capture to Shar
ing."

"I just enjoy showing peo
ple how to do things, whether
it's writing programs, writing
algorithms or taking photos,"
he said. "I get a kick when I
see my students be success
ful, whether it's at computer
science or business or taking
good photos."
He also likes to provide a
hands-on way for his students
to improve, and with that mis
sion in mind, he often invites
groups of his current and for
mer students to follow him to
his sports shoots to give them
a firsthand taste of his style
and techniques. Through
those excursions, he has de
veloped close relationships
with many of his students,
several of whom have become
"regulars" as they have devel
oped as photographers fol
lowing in his footsteps.
That isn't to say that he
has stopped developing as a
photographer himself. One of
the unique things that Garcia-
Molina likes to do is to take
one camera and one lens to
the events that he photo
graphs, and to vary the an
gles, positions and settings
from which he shoots instead

of other settings or configura
tions.

While the lack of equip
ment means that he won't
necessarily get all of the shots
that other photographers
would, he likes the unique
perspective it gives him on
some of the close-range shots
out of the conventional range
of his lens. For somebody with
a scientific mind like Garcia-
Molina's, the process of ex
perimentation and discovery
is just as fascinating as the fin
ished product.
That perspective has also
translated to Garcia-Molina's
photography, for which he not
only continues to develop his
skill and technical ability, but
also has begun to establish an
artistic vision that he chooses
to stick by and convey
through his photos. Much of
that lies in the kinds of shots
that he likes to take: He only
likes to take shots that cap
ture the human element of
scenes, showing his subjects'
expressions in moments of
stress or exertion.
"If I don't see the face, I
don't take the picture," he
said. "It could be just a wax
figure for all I know if I can't
see the face. It just doesn't ex
cite me or interest me as
much."

Because of that, his favorite
events to shoot are sports like
rugby, water polo and synchro
nized swimming, where the ex
ertion of all of the athletes is ev
ident and there is relatively lit
tle covering their faces. In con
trast, he admits that repetitive
sports like baseball in which
caps or helmets obscure faces
and expressions are of less in
terest to him.

In the slideshows of pho

tos that he compiles after each
year of sports, there are vari
ety of grimaces, contortions
and scowls on the faces of the
athletes. But what is constant
through all of the photos is the
careful framing, lighting and
timing that brings the subject
to life and fully conveys the
emotion of the shot.
It's a care that stems from
the passion that started a gen
eration earlier with the elder
Garcia-Molina, but manifest
ed itself relatively late in life

for Hector after his father's
work inspired his fire for the
subject. Will Garcia-Molina's
son the subject of his fa
ther's first serious photos
follow in those footsteps as
well?

"He's not interested,"
Garcia-Molina says with a
laugh. "I've tried to get him
interested, but he just doesn't
like it as much."

Over the last 22 years, Hector
Garcia-Molina M.S.''7s M.S. '77
Ph.D. '79 has slowly but surely
carved his niche into Stanford's
computer science department.
Perhaps best known as the for
mer research advisor to Google co
founder Sergey Brin, Garcia-Moli
na has become one of the premier
names in the fields of digital compu
tation and information technology.
He was the principal investigator
for the Stanford Digital Library
Project in the late 19905, which was
a driving factor behind the eventual
development of the Google search
engine.
That's the side that most people
see, anyway.
Garcia-Molina's extensive work
in computer science only tells half
the story. Yes, Garcia-Molina's aca
demic reputation precedes him, but
his identity is just as much gov
erned by something that started as
a casual hobby but has quickly
transformed into a passion that ri
vals his love for computer science:
photography.
When talking about photogra
phy, Garcia-Molina's eyes light up
and a wide grin spreads across his
face, leaving little doubt about his
love for the art.

"I don't normally do interviews,
but I love to talk about photogra
phy," he said earnestly.
Garcia-Molina gets just as excit
ed talking about his vast collection
oflenses, ofwhichhe "definitely has
too many," as he does talking about
his life's work; he spends his free
time capturing the essence of hu
manity as he sees it and, for hours
on end, lovingly arranging those

snapshots into slideshows that he
carefully pairs with "just the right
music" to showcase to the fullest ef
fect.
Hector Garcia-Molina is a com
puter scientist. But equally so, Hec
tor Garcia-Molina is a photogra
pher.

On any given weekend during
the Stanford sports season, it's a
safe bet that you'll see Garcia-Moli
na on the sidelines snapping photos
of the action for Stanford Athletics.
Looking at how he carries himself

and the quality of his work, it's near
ly impossible to tell that he has no
formal training in the art.
He takes after his father, who
was also a college professor in Mex
ico who took on photography as a se
rious hobby on the side. Over the
years, the elder Garcia-Molina took
thousands of photos and even pur
chased his son a camera to capture
his interest.
Though the camera certainly
helped Garcia-Molina get early ex
posure to photography, his father's
more significant contribution to his

photography career was more indi
rect, initially manifesting as a star
tling discovery on a trip home 20
years ago.
"My mother said, 'l'm cleaning
this closet, and I'm going to throw
away all of the slides that your fa
ther has. They're just gathering
dust and we haven't seen them in
years,"' Garcia-Molina recounted.
'"The projector broke, and we just
don't want them here.' This is liter
ally a closet full of 35-millimeter

Hector Garcia-Molina M.S. '75 M.S. '77 Ph.D. '79 is well known in the field of computer science;
however, he also has a strong passion for sports photography and volunteers for Stanford Athletics.
transparencies. I just said,
'Wait a minute, wait a minute;
you can't just throw these
out! Give me a second, let me
have a few of them!'"

After his mother prom
ised that she wouldn't throw
any of the shots out, Garcia-
Molina's technology-focused
mind kicked into gear and
drove him to search both
books and the web for ways in
which he could restore those
transparencies often
dusty, scratched and at times
moldy and preserve those
memories.

Although it was a com
pletely unfamiliar area and the
learning curve was steep,
months of hard work from
Garcia-Molina proved fruitful;
he was able to not only resur
rect decades of family memo
ries that he was able to share,
but also gain valuable first
hand experience working with
photos that only furthered his
interest and gave him better
technical ability in the field.

"I discovered it was lots of
fun. These pictures that I
wouldn't remember would
come to life," he said. "The ef
fect was great, because I
could improve the lighting
and cropping. My father was
very passionate but he wasn't
very good at framing and get
ting the light right. In Photo
shop, I could fix a lot of that,
and I started building up a col
lection of family photos in
much better shape."
As he developed his eye for
photography and resurrected
his father's work, he started
out with his first SLR camera
just as many amateur photog
raphers have: by messing
around with his camera to
document the growth of his
child.

"I took pictures of [my
son] and family pictures and
so on, just like any father
would take," he said. "But
only when he went off to col
lege and I had more time, I
started taking pictures of
other things."
And as incidentally as his
photography career had
started, Garcia-Molina's
sports photography career
began in just as impromptu of
a manner. One day, he bought
a new lens and was itching to
try it out, but his son wasn't
around to be his subject and
he decided to go take a walk

around Stanford to find some
thing new to document.
"For some reason, I went
around the athletic fields to
find something to photograph
and there were some soccer
players practicing," he said. "I
just stood there and took
some pictures, and I enjoyed
it. It was a challenge to get
things in focus and get the
right moment."
That initial foray into
sports photography piqued
his interest, and on his next
outing, he was in the stands of
a Stanford athletic matchup
taking photos from the
stands. It eventually became
a regular pastime of his, and
when the other volunteer pho
tographers at Stanford Ph
oto.com noticed him and invit
ed him to join them several
years later, he eagerly accept
ed the opportunity.

Not only would Garcia-
Molina have the chance to
showcase his work on a larger
stage under the banner of
Stanford Athletics, but he
would also be able to go to
whatever events he wanted
and take photos whenever he
wanted, giving him a formal
outlet for his passion. He has
since firmly established him
self as one of the most talent
ed sports photographers on
that staff.

Today, Garcia-Molina con
tinues to shoot photos for
Stanford Athletics but has

also managed to bring togeth
er the two fields that he is
most passionate about aca
demics and photography
in the form of the freshman
seminar that he teaches:
"Computers and Photogra
phy: From Capture to Shar
ing."

"I just enjoy showing peo
ple how to do things, whether
it's writing programs, writing
algorithms or taking photos,"
he said. "I get a kick when I
see my students be success
ful, whether it's at computer
science or business or taking
good photos."
He also likes to provide a
hands-on way for his students
to improve, and with that mis
sion in mind, he often invites
groups of his current and for
mer students to follow him to
his sports shoots to give them
a firsthand taste of his style
and techniques. Through
those excursions, he has de
veloped close relationships
with many of his students,
several of whom have become
"regulars" as they have devel
oped as photographers fol
lowing in his footsteps.
That isn't to say that he
has stopped developing as a
photographer himself. One of
the unique things that Garcia-
Molina likes to do is to take
one camera and one lens to
the events that he photo
graphs, and to vary the an
gles, positions and settings
from which he shoots instead

of other settings or configura
tions.

While the lack of equip
ment means that he won't
necessarily get all of the shots
that other photographers
would, he likes the unique
perspective it gives him on
some of the close-range shots
out of the conventional range
of his lens. For somebody with
a scientific mind like Garcia-
Molina's, the process of ex
perimentation and discovery
is just as fascinating as the fin
ished product.
That perspective has also
translated to Garcia-Molina's
photography, for which he not
only continues to develop his
skill and technical ability, but
also has begun to establish an
artistic vision that he chooses
to stick by and convey
through his photos. Much of
that lies in the kinds of shots
that he likes to take: He only
likes to take shots that cap
ture the human element of
scenes, showing his subjects'
expressions in moments of
stress or exertion.
"If I don't see the face, I
don't take the picture," he
said. "It could be just a wax
figure for all I know if I can't
see the face. It just doesn't ex
cite me or interest me as
much."

Because of that, his favorite
events to shoot are sports like
rugby, water polo and synchro
nized swimming, where the ex
ertion of all of the athletes is ev
ident and there is relatively lit
tle covering their faces. In con
trast, he admits that repetitive
sports like baseball in which
caps or helmets obscure faces
and expressions are of less in

ment means that he won't
necessarily get all of the shots
that other photographers
would, he likes the unique
perspective it gives him on
some of the close-range shots
out of the conventional range
of his lens. For somebody with
a scientific mind like Garcia-
Molina's, the process of ex
perimentation and discovery
is just as fascinating as the fin
ished product.
That perspective has also
translated to Garcia-Molina's
photography, for which he not
only continues to develop his
skill and technical ability, but
also has begun to establish an
artistic vision that he chooses
to stick by and convey
through his photos. Much of
that lies in the kinds of shots
that he likes to take: He only
likes to take shots that cap
ture the human element of
scenes, showing his subjects'
expressions in moments of
stress or exertion.
"If I don't see the face, I
don't take the picture," he
said. "It could be just a wax
figure for all I know if I can't
see the face. It just doesn't ex
cite me or interest me as
much."

Because of that, his favorite
events to shoot are sports like
rugby, water polo and synchro
nized swimming, where the ex
ertion of all of the athletes is ev
ident and there is relatively lit
tle covering their faces. In con
trast, he admits that repetitive
sports like baseball in which
caps or helmets obscure faces
and expressions are of less in
terest to him.

In the slideshows of pho

tos that he compiles after each
year of sports, there are vari
ety of grimaces, contortions
and scowls on the faces of the
athletes. But what is constant
through all of the photos is the
careful framing, lighting and
timing that brings the subject
to life and fully conveys the
emotion of the shot.
It's a care that stems from
the passion that started a gen
eration earlier with the elder
Garcia-Molina, but manifest
ed itself relatively late in life

for Hector after his father's
work inspired his fire for the
subject. Will Garcia-Molina's
son the subject of his fa
ther's first serious photos
follow in those footsteps as
well?

"He's not interested,"
Garcia-Molina says with a
laugh. "I've tried to get him
interested, but he just doesn't
like it as much."

Over the last 22 years, Hector
Garcia-Molina M.S.''7s M.S. '77
Ph.D. '79 has slowly but surely
carved his niche into Stanford's
computer science department.
Perhaps best known as the for
mer research advisor to Google co
founder Sergey Brin, Garcia-Moli
na has become one of the premier
names in the fields of digital compu
tation and information technology.
He was the principal investigator
for the Stanford Digital Library
Project in the late 19905, which was
a driving factor behind the eventual
development of the Google search
engine.
That's the side that most people
see, anyway.
Garcia-Molina's extensive work
in computer science only tells half
the story. Yes, Garcia-Molina's aca
demic reputation precedes him, but
his identity is just as much gov
erned by something that started as
a casual hobby but has quickly
transformed into a passion that ri
vals his love for computer science:
photography.
When talking about photogra
phy, Garcia-Molina's eyes light up
and a wide grin spreads across his
face, leaving little doubt about his
love for the art.

"I don't normally do interviews,
but I love to talk about photogra
phy," he said earnestly.
Garcia-Molina gets just as excit
ed talking about his vast collection
oflenses, ofwhichhe "definitely has
too many," as he does talking about
his life's work; he spends his free
time capturing the essence of hu
manity as he sees it and, for hours
on end, lovingly arranging those

snapshots into slideshows that he
carefully pairs with "just the right
music" to showcase to the fullest ef
fect.
Hector Garcia-Molina is a com
puter scientist. But equally so, Hec
tor Garcia-Molina is a photogra
pher.

On any given weekend during
the Stanford sports season, it's a
safe bet that you'll see Garcia-Moli
na on the sidelines snapping photos
of the action for Stanford Athletics.
Looking at how he carries himself

and the quality of his work, it's near
ly impossible to tell that he has no
formal training in the art.
He takes after his father, who
was also a college professor in Mex
ico who took on photography as a se
rious hobby on the side. Over the
years, the elder Garcia-Molina took
thousands of photos and even pur
chased his son a camera to capture
his interest.
Though the camera certainly
helped Garcia-Molina get early ex
posure to photography, his father's
more significant contribution to his

photography career was more indi
rect, initially manifesting as a star
tling discovery on a trip home 20
years ago.
"My mother said, 'l'm cleaning
this closet, and I'm going to throw
away all of the slides that your fa
ther has. They're just gathering
dust and we haven't seen them in
years,"' Garcia-Molina recounted.
'"The projector broke, and we just
don't want them here.' This is liter
ally a closet full of 35-millimeter

Hector Garcia-Molina M.S. '75 M.S. '77 Ph.D. '79 is well known in the field of computer science;
however, he also has a strong passion for sports photography and volunteers for Stanford Athletics.
transparencies. I just said,
'Wait a minute, wait a minute;
you can't just throw these
out! Give me a second, let me
have a few of them!'"

After his mother prom
ised that she wouldn't throw
any of the shots out, Garcia-
Molina's technology-focused
mind kicked into gear and
drove him to search both
books and the web for ways in
which he could restore those
transparencies often
dusty, scratched and at times
moldy and preserve those
memories.

Although it was a com
pletely unfamiliar area and the
learning curve was steep,
months of hard work from
Garcia-Molina proved fruitful;
he was able to not only resur
rect decades of family memo
ries that he was able to share,
but also gain valuable first
hand experience working with
photos that only furthered his
interest and gave him better
technical ability in the field.

"I discovered it was lots of
fun. These pictures that I
wouldn't remember would
come to life," he said. "The ef
fect was great, because I
could improve the lighting
and cropping. My father was
very passionate but he wasn't
very good at framing and get
ting the light right. In Photo
shop, I could fix a lot of that,
and I started building up a col
lection of family photos in
much better shape."
As he developed his eye for
photography and resurrected
his father's work, he started
out with his first SLR camera
just as many amateur photog
raphers have: by messing
around with his camera to
document the growth of his
child.

"I took pictures of [my
son] and family pictures and
so on, just like any father
would take," he said. "But
only when he went off to col
lege and I had more time, I
started taking pictures of
other things."
And as incidentally as his
photography career had
started, Garcia-Molina's
sports photography career
began in just as impromptu of
a manner. One day, he bought
a new lens and was itching to
try it out, but his son wasn't
around to be his subject and
he decided to go take a walk

around Stanford to find some
thing new to document.
"For some reason, I went
around the athletic fields to
find something to photograph
and there were some soccer
players practicing," he said. "I
just stood there and took
some pictures, and I enjoyed
it. It was a challenge to get
things in focus and get the
right moment."
That initial foray into
sports photography piqued
his interest, and on his next
outing, he was in the stands of
a Stanford athletic matchup
taking photos from the
stands. It eventually became
a regular pastime of his, and
when the other volunteer pho
tographers at Stanford Ph
oto.com noticed him and invit
ed him to join them several
years later, he eagerly accept
ed the opportunity.

Not only would Garcia-
Molina have the chance to
showcase his work on a larger
stage under the banner of
Stanford Athletics, but he
would also be able to go to
whatever events he wanted
and take photos whenever he
wanted, giving him a formal
outlet for his passion. He has
since firmly established him
self as one of the most talent
ed sports photographers on
that staff.

Today, Garcia-Molina con
tinues to shoot photos for
Stanford Athletics but has

also managed to bring togeth
er the two fields that he is
most passionate about aca
demics and photography
in the form of the freshman
seminar that he teaches:
"Computers and Photogra
phy: From Capture to Shar
ing."

"I just enjoy showing peo
ple how to do things, whether
it's writing programs, writing
algorithms or taking photos,"
he said. "I get a kick when I
see my students be success
ful, whether it's at computer
science or business or taking
good photos."
He also likes to provide a
hands-on way for his students
to improve, and with that mis
sion in mind, he often invites
groups of his current and for
mer students to follow him to
his sports shoots to give them
a firsthand taste of his style
and techniques. Through
those excursions, he has de
veloped close relationships
with many of his students,
several of whom have become
"regulars" as they have devel
oped as photographers fol
lowing in his footsteps.
That isn't to say that he
has stopped developing as a
photographer himself. One of
the unique things that Garcia-
Molina likes to do is to take
one camera and one lens to
the events that he photo
graphs, and to vary the an
gles, positions and settings
from which he shoots instead

of other settings or configura
tions.

ment means that he won't
