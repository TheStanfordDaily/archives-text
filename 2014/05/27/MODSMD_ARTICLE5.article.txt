# Seeing Garcia-Molina through a different lens
## 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK MANAGING EDITOR 
Over the last 22 years, Hector
Garcia-Molina M.S.''7s M.S. '77
Ph.D. '79 has slowly but surely
carved his niche into Stanford's
computer science department.
Perhaps best known as the for
mer research advisor to Google co
founder Sergey Brin, Garcia-Moli
na has become one of the premier
names in the fields of digital compu
tation and information technology.
He was the principal investigator
for the Stanford Digital Library
Project in the late 19905, which was
a driving factor behind the eventual
development of the Google search
engine.
That's the side that most people
see, anyway.
Garcia-Molina's extensive work
in computer science only tells half
the story. Yes, Garcia-Molina's aca
demic reputation precedes him, but
his identity is just as much gov
erned by something that started as
a casual hobby but has quickly
transformed into a passion that ri
vals his love for computer science:
photography.
When talking about photogra
phy, Garcia-Molina's eyes light up
and a wide grin spreads across his
face, leaving little doubt about his
love for the art.

"I don't normally do interviews,
but I love to talk about photogra
phy," he said earnestly.
Garcia-Molina gets just as excit
ed talking about his vast collection
oflenses, ofwhichhe "definitely has
too many," as he does talking about
his life's work; he spends his free
time capturing the essence of hu
manity as he sees it and, for hours
on end, lovingly arranging those

snapshots into slideshows that he
carefully pairs with "just the right
music" to showcase to the fullest ef
fect.
Hector Garcia-Molina is a com
puter scientist. But equally so, Hec
tor Garcia-Molina is a photogra
pher.

On any given weekend during
the Stanford sports season, it's a
safe bet that you'll see Garcia-Moli
na on the sidelines snapping photos
of the action for Stanford Athletics.
Looking at how he carries himself

and the quality of his work, it's near
ly impossible to tell that he has no
formal training in the art.
He takes after his father, who
was also a college professor in Mex
ico who took on photography as a se
rious hobby on the side. Over the
years, the elder Garcia-Molina took
thousands of photos and even pur
chased his son a camera to capture
his interest.
Though the camera certainly
helped Garcia-Molina get early ex
posure to photography, his father's
more significant contribution to his

photography career was more indi
rect, initially manifesting as a star
tling discovery on a trip home 20
years ago.
"My mother said, 'l'm cleaning
this closet, and I'm going to throw
away all of the slides that your fa
ther has. They're just gathering
dust and we haven't seen them in
years,"' Garcia-Molina recounted.
'"The projector broke, and we just
don't want them here.' This is liter
ally a closet full of 35-millimeter
