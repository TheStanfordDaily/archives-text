## Memories of Donovan's plays will never die 
### Michael Peterson 
Every United States soccer
fan remembers where he
or she was on that thrilling
day. As for me, I was tak
ing my Algebra II final in
high school. Rather than being one of
the students who checked their
phones to text other students about
the test, I was the one who would
sneak looks to my phone to receive up
dates from my sister about the game
the game that will go down as one of
the greatest in United States men's
soccer history.
Throughout the game, I kept re
ceiving texts about how close the Unit
ed States came to scoring. Clint
Dempsey scored within the first 30
minutes but was ruled offsides, in
spite of replays showing otherwise.
Dempsey later hit the post on a run
and sent the subsequent rebound just
wide with an essentially empty net in
front of him. The United States faced
many opportunities, but it just could
n't seem to take advantage and ap
peared destined for a 0-0 tie, when a
win would send the team through the
group stage and into the knockout
rounds.

If you haven't figured it out by now,
I'm talking about the United States'
group stage game against Algeria
during the 2010 World Cup. A tie or
loss by the United States meant the
end of the World Cup for one of the
country's best-ever squads, but a win
would send the country into the round
of 16 a monumental difference, es
pecially for the United States' histori
cally mediocre program. And if you re
member that game, I'm sure you
know where I'm going next.
It was still tied 0-0 at the 90-minute
mark and headed to stoppage time.
The return plane tickets were booked.
United States fans that had made the
trip to South Africa were surely can
celling then' hotel reservations. A
promising opportunity—win against
Algeria and move on —was about to
be wasted and lingering doubts about
the state of soccer in the United States
would be confirmed.
And then, in a quick 15-second
counterattacking flurry, American
soccer hero Landon Donovan deliv
ered the Hollywood ending that Unit
ed States men's soccer had always
wanted, but never grasped. As ESPN
commentator lan Darke quickly pro
claimed, "You could not write a script
like this." Donovan's follow-through
goal both secured a berth in the round
of 16 and sent wild celebrations
throughout America that were com
pletely unparalleled for soccer in the
United States.
Donovan, now the United States'
all-time leader in goals and assists, is
unquestionably the greatest soccer
player to ever don a United States jer
sey. That fact is undisputed. Not only
did he always have a knack for scoring
goals, but he seemed to have a talent
for scoring the most opportune ones
as well: the equalizer against Slovenia
in the previous game to earn an all-im
portant point for the United States, a
goal against Mexico in 2002 to help put
the United States into the World Cup
quarterfinals, a clinical counter-at
tacking goal to put the United States
ahead 2-0 against Brazil in the 2009
Confederations Cup and now ar
guably the most important goal in
United States men's soccer history.
With Donovan on the pitch, there
was always interest and intrigue in the
national team. Fans love their super
stars, and he was the brightest star
yet. While we always wondered if
some of the greatest American ath
letes could be lured away from foot
ball, basketball and baseball to play
soccer, Donovan showed that we didn't
necessarily need our- best athletes to
switch to soccer to be competitive. At
5-foot-8, Donovan still possessed light
ning-in-a-bottle speed and a creative
flair that allowed him to run directly at
the opposition, something that was al
ways lacking in the American interna
tional game.
The goal against Algeria served as
the coronation ceremony for Dono
van, vaulting him from simply a hero
to an American legend after a decade
of similarly thrilling moments and as
tounding plays. The best player deliv
ered on the biggest stage in the most
important of moments.
Yet, though no fan at the time
would have ever guessed, that would,
in all likelihood, be the second-to-last
World Cup goal he would ever score.
When the United States fell to Ghana
in extra time in the knockout stages,
the United States' greatest player
prematurely exited the grandest soc
cer stage of them all.
The legend of American soccer

went out not with the bang that
seemed to define his storied
soccer career, but with a whim
per. Head coach Jurgen Klins
mann shocked the country
with not only the timing of his
2014 World Cup roster an
nouncement, but also the fact
that Donovan, America's dar
ling, would not be on it. Barring
an injury to a midfielder or a
forward in the next couple
weeks or some age-defying
heroics for the 2018 World
Cup, Landon Donovan will
never play in a World Cup
match again.
I'm not here to debate
whether or not Donovan
should have made the World
Cup roster. I may have my own
personal opinions, but I will
leave that discussion to the

more technically knowledge
able soccer media around the
United States.
Instead, I want to com
memorate Donovan for the
charismatic game-changer
that he has been for over a
decade now and make sure we
reminisce on the bang and not
the whimper in years to come.
He was the "little engine that
could," the homegrown Cali
fornia boy that proved Ameri
ca could produce a soccer su
perstar, the Superman who
would always show up when it
mattered most and, simply
put, the greatest American
soccer player in history
The fictional Babe Ruth
said it best in The Sandlot
when he stated that "heroes
get remembered, but leg
ends never die." American
soccer had seen heroes be
fore those who scored im
portant qualifying or World
Cup goals. But Donovan was
the first legend who scored

the important goals, time
and time again.
It's going to be a strange
sight to see the United States
men's soccer team compete
without Landon Donovan at
the World Cup, especially
knowing that it might have
been four years too soon.
However, Donovan's status
as a legend is already clear,
regardless of what could
have happened at the 2014
World Cup, and the feats he
performed on the soccer field
will never die.

By sculpting stick an eloquent
column for the demise of Lan
don Donovan's international
career; Michael Peterson set
the stage for somebody else to
write another such column
when it comes time for him to
step down as a sportswriter.
Tell Michael who you want to
write that column for him at

The goal against Algeria served as
the coronation ceremony for Dono
van, vaulting him from simply a hero
to an American legend after a decade
of similarly thrilling moments and as
tounding plays. The best player deliv
ered on the biggest stage in the most
important of moments.
Yet, though no fan at the time
would have ever guessed, that would,
in all likelihood, be the second-to-last
World Cup goal he would ever score.
When the United States fell to Ghana
in extra time in the knockout stages,
the United States' greatest player
prematurely exited the grandest soc
cer stage of them all.
The legend of American soccer

went out not with the bang that
seemed to define his storied
soccer career, but with a whim
per. Head coach Jurgen Klins
mann shocked the country
with not only the timing of his
2014 World Cup roster an
nouncement, but also the fact
that Donovan, America's dar
ling, would not be on it. Barring
an injury to a midfielder or a
forward in the next couple
weeks or some age-defying
heroics for the 2018 World
Cup, Landon Donovan will
never play in a World Cup
match again.
I'm not here to debate
whether or not Donovan
should have made the World
Cup roster. I may have my own
personal opinions, but I will
leave that discussion to the

more technically knowledge
able soccer media around the
United States.
Instead, I want to com
memorate Donovan for the
charismatic game-changer
that he has been for over a
decade now and make sure we
reminisce on the bang and not
the whimper in years to come.
He was the "little engine that
could," the homegrown Cali
fornia boy that proved Ameri
ca could produce a soccer su
perstar, the Superman who
would always show up when it
mattered most and, simply
put, the greatest American
soccer player in history
The fictional Babe Ruth
said it best in The Sandlot
when he stated that "heroes
get remembered, but leg
ends never die." American
soccer had seen heroes be
fore those who scored im
portant qualifying or World
Cup goals. But Donovan was
the first legend who scored

the important goals, time
and time again.
It's going to be a strange
sight to see the United States
men's soccer team compete
without Landon Donovan at
the World Cup, especially
knowing that it might have
been four years too soon.
However, Donovan's status
as a legend is already clear,
regardless of what could
have happened at the 2014
World Cup, and the feats he
performed on the soccer field
will never die.

column for the demise of Lan
don Donovan's international
career; Michael Peterson set
the stage for somebody else to
write another such column
when it comes time for him to
step down as a sportswriter.

Every United States soccer
fan remembers where he
or she was on that thrilling
day. As for me, I was tak
ing my Algebra II final in
high school. Rather than being one of
the students who checked their
phones to text other students about
the test, I was the one who would
sneak looks to my phone to receive up
dates from my sister about the game
the game that will go down as one of
the greatest in United States men's
soccer history.
Throughout the game, I kept re
ceiving texts about how close the Unit
ed States came to scoring. Clint
Dempsey scored within the first 30
minutes but was ruled offsides, in
spite of replays showing otherwise.
Dempsey later hit the post on a run
and sent the subsequent rebound just
wide with an essentially empty net in
front of him. The United States faced
many opportunities, but it just could
n't seem to take advantage and ap
peared destined for a 0-0 tie, when a
win would send the team through the
group stage and into the knockout
rounds.

If you haven't figured it out by now,
I'm talking about the United States'
group stage game against Algeria
during the 2010 World Cup. A tie or
loss by the United States meant the
end of the World Cup for one of the
country's best-ever squads, but a win
would send the country into the round
of 16 a monumental difference, es
pecially for the United States' histori
cally mediocre program. And if you re
member that game, I'm sure you
know where I'm going next.
It was still tied 0-0 at the 90-minute
mark and headed to stoppage time.
The return plane tickets were booked.
United States fans that had made the
trip to South Africa were surely can
celling then' hotel reservations. A
promising opportunity—win against
Algeria and move on —was about to
be wasted and lingering doubts about
the state of soccer in the United States
would be confirmed.
And then, in a quick 15-second
counterattacking flurry, American
soccer hero Landon Donovan deliv
ered the Hollywood ending that Unit
ed States men's soccer had always
wanted, but never grasped. As ESPN
commentator lan Darke quickly pro
claimed, "You could not write a script
like this." Donovan's follow-through
goal both secured a berth in the round
of 16 and sent wild celebrations
throughout America that were com
pletely unparalleled for soccer in the
United States.
Donovan, now the United States'
all-time leader in goals and assists, is
unquestionably the greatest soccer
player to ever don a United States jer
sey. That fact is undisputed. Not only
did he always have a knack for scoring
goals, but he seemed to have a talent
for scoring the most opportune ones
as well: the equalizer against Slovenia
in the previous game to earn an all-im
portant point for the United States, a
goal against Mexico in 2002 to help put
the United States into the World Cup
quarterfinals, a clinical counter-at
tacking goal to put the United States
ahead 2-0 against Brazil in the 2009
Confederations Cup and now ar
guably the most important goal in
United States men's soccer history.
With Donovan on the pitch, there
was always interest and intrigue in the
national team. Fans love their super
stars, and he was the brightest star
yet. While we always wondered if
some of the greatest American ath
letes could be lured away from foot
ball, basketball and baseball to play
soccer, Donovan showed that we didn't
necessarily need our- best athletes to
switch to soccer to be competitive. At
5-foot-8, Donovan still possessed light
ning-in-a-bottle speed and a creative
flair that allowed him to run directly at
the opposition, something that was al
ways lacking in the American interna
tional game.
