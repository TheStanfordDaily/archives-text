# KIM'S COMING-OUT PARTY
## Sophomore earns third individually, but team falters 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
Winning NCAA championships in events in which
an individual performance factors into the team's score
tennis, cross country, track and field, golf re
quires a group to have "low sticks" and solid depth.
This is to say that teams need contributions from both
its frontrunners and back-of-the-lineup players to se
cure a trophy. One without the other will usually not
complete the task. It takes a special group to coax out
both at the same time; the old saying, "if it were easy,
everyone would do it," certainly applies here.
The Stanford women's golf team entered the 2014
NCAA Women's Golf Championships in Tulsa, Oklaho
ma with the distinct possibility of getting this type of
championship production from its quintet; sophomores
Lauren Kim and Mariah Stackhouse were sure to lead
the way at the top of the individual leaderboard, while
some combination of freshman Casey Danielson and
veterans Mariko Tumangan and Marissa Mar had the
talent and experience fill the 3-4 slots.
But the Cardinal were only able to churn out half of
the winning equation on the Tulsa Country Club last
week en route to a disappointing 18th place finish in the
24-team event. The lone bright spot in head coach Anne
Walker's unit was Kim, who played perhaps the best
the collegiate tournament of her career, placing third in
a historically competitive field.
"Obviously we are disappointed to come to the finals
and finish 18th," Walker said of her team's final posi
tion. "We had a great season and were looking forward
to the opportunity to compete for a top-10 finish this
week. But that's golf. It just wasn't to be; it wasn't our
week."
While it may not have been Stanford's week, it was
certainly Kim's. The sophomore, whose play during her
second season has caused many to rethink who the best

Sophomore Lauren Kim (above) played perhaps the best tournament of her career over
the weekend, recording the highest national finish for a Stanford player since 1992.
female golfer on the Farm is,
held the outright lead at sev
eral points during the 72-hole
championships, including
midway through her final
round. Scores of 67-71-72 put
her T-3rd going into Friday's
fourth frame, which she exe
cuted exquisitely: 2-under
through her first eight holes,
the Los Altos High School
graduate fired four consecu
tive birdies on 9-12 to move
atop the leadei'board.
Although she was in the
morning wave meaning
that she could be surpassed
by golfers teeing off later in
the day Kim had a three
stroke advantage after her
first 13 holes, a difference
that put pressure on her op
ponents.

"That [3-under on the
front-nine] was really excit
ing for me," Kim said after
her round. "I was dropping
putts and giving myself good
opportunities and good looks
at birdie. I was just in the
zone and in my rhythm.
Everything was working re
ally well, so it was a good
stretch of holes and got me
going for the rest of the
round."

However, Kim's lead
evaporated on the latter half
of her back nine, as a bogey
on the par-3, 175-yard 14th
and a seven on the par-516th
just her second of the
event dropped her down
to three-under for the tour
nament. Still, hope sprung
eternal for the Stanford
local, as she knew the after
noon groups had not yet
played and that there was
still a chance for the coveted
victory.
"One of the things coach
[Walker] and I always talk
about and that I have been
working on is just staying in
the present more and not
thinking about the past too
much," Kim said following
her fourth-round 3-under 67.
"That really helped and I
know that anything can hap
pen. I think being in the
morning wave helped too be
cause it helped me put things
in perspective and realize
you really do not know what
will happen."
But the victory she envi
sioned never materialized, as
54-hole co-leaders Doris
Chen of USC and Celine
Boutier of Duke battled in
tensely for top honors, which
ultimately went to Chen.
Boutier's fourth-round 1-
under 69 left Kim alone in
third place, the highest finish
for a Stanford golfer at an
NCAA championship event
since 1992. Despite narrowly
missing out on what would
have been the biggest win of
her life yet, Kim was never
theless lauded by her coach
for her excellent play.
"Lauren was terrific this
week," Walker said. "She was
successful because the
course was set up like a
major championship. You
had to keep the ball in play at
all times, and Lauren's game
is such that her misses are
very small and she always
had a roll at par. That allowed
her to be very successful."
Unfortunately, the same

could not be said for the rest
of the Card's lineup. After
finishing T-29th at the NCAA
Finals a year ago, Stack
house couldn't improve on
that performance in Tulsa,
placing T-33rd with a cumu
lative 9-over 289 score.
Stackhouse struggled
with her consistency at the
Tulsa Country Club, combin
ing to shoot even in her sec
ond and fourth rounds, but 9-
over in the first and third.
Particularly telling of Stan
ford's issues with the back
end of its lineup was the fact
that she was the only other
Stanford player in the top 90,
with Danielson coming-in at
T-94th deviating heavily
from the impressive num
bers she put up over the
course of the spring cam
paign.

Tumangan and Mar were
similarly unable to provide
Stanford the fourth score it
needed to be competitive, fin
ishing T-116th and T-118th
respectively in the 126-
woman field. Still, Walker
saw through the struggles
and noted the distinct upside
of having a young team: They
are coming back next season.
"Our top finishers from
this week will all be return
ing next year, and that gives
us great confidence and ex
citement heading into the
2014-15 season," Walker
said.

The Stanford program,
while losing experienced sen
iors Mar and Danielle Eraser,
is bringing in an outstanding
recruiting class that includes
France's Shannon Aubert,
the No. 46 female amateur in
the world. By adding her to a
lineup already featuring
Kim, Stackhouse and Daniel
son, the Card will have an in
credibly potent group that
will be out to defend its Pac
-12 title and finish strong at
the NCAA Championships.
