## Sophomore earns third individually, but team falters

Winning NCAA championships in events in which
an individual performance factors into the team's score

quires a group to have "low sticks" and solid depth.
This is to say that teams need contributions from both
its frontrunners and back-of-the-lineup players to se

complete the task. It takes a special group to coax out
both at the same time; the old saying, "if it were easy,
everyone would do it," certainly applies here.
The Stanford women's golf team entered the 2014
NCAA Women's Golf Championships in Tulsa, Oklaho

championship production from its quintet; sophomores
Lauren Kim and Mariah Stackhouse were sure to lead
the way at the top of the individual leaderboard, while
some combination of freshman Casey Danielson and
veterans Mariko Tumangan and Marissa Mar had the
talent and experience fill the 3-4 slots.
But the Cardinal were only able to churn out half of
the winning equation on the Tulsa Country Club last
week en route to a disappointing 18th place finish in the
24-team event. The lone bright spot in head coach Anne
Walker's unit was Kim, who played perhaps the best
the collegiate tournament of her career, placing third in
a historically competitive field.
"Obviously we are disappointed to come to the finals
and finish 18th," Walker said of her team's final posi
tion. "We had a great season and were looking forward
to the opportunity to compete for a top-10 finish this
week. But that's golf. It just wasn't to be; it wasn't our
week."
While it may not have been Stanford's week, it was
certainly Kim's. The sophomore, whose play during her
second season has caused many to rethink who the best
