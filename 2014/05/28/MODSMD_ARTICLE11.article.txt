## Tenant rights in East Palo Alto: Historical legacies and learning by service 
### Aileen Lerch 
What do three engineering
students, a history seminar
class and spreading aware
ness about tenant rights in East
Palo Alto have in common? Don't
worry before this quarter I
would not have known how to an
swer this question either.
This spring, I enrolled in the
class History 260: California's Mi
nority-Majority Cities taught by
Professor Carol McKibben. Joel
Dominguez, Juan Jimenez and I, as
engineers, found ourselves quite out
of our comfort zones. I discovered
that I could replace writing the final
essay if I chose to participate in a
Haas Center service-learning proj
ect, and, to be honest, I will do pret
ty much anything to get out of writ
ing a paper. I decided this option
was for me.

The service-learning project
paired us with Community Legal
Services in East Palo Alto
(CLSEPA), a non-profit legal serv
ices provider specializing in hous
ing, immigration and civil litigation.
Our project was to knock on resi
dents' doors in East Palo Alto (EPA)
to spread awareness about the need
to pay rent when it is due, on the Ist
of every month. While this may
seem like a trivial detail, it is actual
ly quite important in EPA.
Equity Residential, an apart
ment-rental company, owns the
Woodland Park residential com

plexes in EPA and has begun to ag
gressively evict tenants on the basis
of late rent payments despite
their message that it is acceptable to
delay a rent payment until the sth of
the month. Woodland Park is doing
so because, once tenants are evict
ed, owners can remodel the apart
ments, increase the rent and then
market the apartments to wealthier,
more profitable tenants. While we
discuss the issue of Google buses in
San Francisco, gentrification is oc
curring right in Stanford's back
yard.
Explaining that process first re
quires some context. East Palo Alto
is considered a minority-majority
city; census data from 2010 reports
that EPA is 64.5 percent Latino/a.
Meanwhile, the surrounding areas
of Palo Alto and Menlo Park are ma
jority-white spaces. While those
cities have high-achieving public
high schools such as Gunn, Palo Alto
and Menlo-Atherton, EPA has no
public high school at all; students
must be bused to Atherton, Belmont
or Woodside.
When it comes to housing in par
ticular, while the affluent areas that
define Silicon Valley have mostly
single-family homes, EPA contains
mostly affordable housing in the
form of apartment complexes. And
while those cities in Silicon Valley
are considered some of the "most
desirable" places to live in the U.S.,

EPA is frequently referred to as an
"undesirable" city because of the
predominance of minority groups
and the associations with high crime
and poverty.

Talking to the residents of East
Palo Alto, however, challenged my
opinion of the situation. While I
have been conditioned to look down
upon EPA and even fear it, the serv
ice learning I participated in
changed my entire outlook. I began
to recognize that EPA is not just
some run-down area, but rather a
city that people connect with per
sonally and value deeply. This real
ization also profoundly altered my
view of CLSEPA. It is not simply a
non-profit; it is organization that is
making tangible differences in this
nearby community and fighting for
what they as well as I believe
is just.
My big takeaway from this class
and the corresponding service
learning? This urban development
was intentional. A free market did
not cause this racial and economic
divide.
In class, the readings primarily
focused on the development of the
minority-majority cities of Los An
geles, Oakland, Stockton and Sea
side. The readings demonstrated
that the development of these mi
nority-majority cities was not by
