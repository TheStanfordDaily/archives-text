## Finn-anigans: memories of a beloved cat 
### Chelsey Sveinsson 
I remember clearly the first time
I met Finnegan my freshman
year. I was on my way to Wilbur
Dining Hall one day and right
smack in the middle of the patio out
side the dining hall was this beauti
ful black and white cat soaking up
the sunbeams.
As someone who has grown up
with dogs her whole life and has
many scars from friendly-looking
(key word: looking) cats, I hesitat
ed for maybe a total of five seconds
before slowly approaching this ma
jestic feline. Kneeling to the ground
at a safe distance from his claws, I
tried to catch his gaze to discern if
the glint in his eyes was inviting or

defiant. Failing to tap into my inner-
Dr. Doolittle and unable to resist my
urge to pet this furry feline, my
hand crept closer to his side, hyp
notically heaving in the sunlight.
As my fingertips gently im
mersed themselves into his soft fur,
my heart warmed with affection
that only pets can induce. I can
trust this one, I thought to myself.
Growing in confidence, I spent
several minutes stroking from head
to tail until I finally succumbed to
the persistent, nagging voice in my
head reminding me of the IHUM
reading waiting for me on my desk.
Getting up off the ground, I distinct
ly remember my knees aching from

kneeling and squatting so long but I
didn't mind the ache as much as I
did the depressing thought of not
running into this mysterious,
friendly cat again.
Little did I know that Finnegan
would not only be around but would
also be a source of support and com
fort for me my sophomore year,
when I felt defeated and lonely amid
the throes of the "sophomore
slump."
Sophomore year was by far the
worst year for me at Stanford. Be
tween taking 18-22 unit quarters,
trying not to drown in the Humßio
core and dealing with confi
dence and identity issues of
no longer being a varsity ath
lete for the first time since
6th grade, I truly felt lost and
left alone to deal with my is

sues. Although I eventually
reached out to my professors
and even CAPS for help,
nothing or no one made me
feel more at peace than
Finnegan.
Several nights during
sophomore year I would be
dragging my feet down Es
condido Road at ungodly
early morning hours and
would occasionally run into
Finn, prowling in the shrub
bery around Arrillaga Din
ing Hall.
One particular night, as I
walking home with two of my
friends, Finnegan emerged
from the shadows and ap
proached us. Having been es
corted home by him several
times before that night, I was
excited to introduce my fe
line friend and to ask him to
walk us home. To my shock
and slight bemusement, my
friends were utterly terrified
of him! To this day I still
haven't figured out if they
were intimidated by his bold
ness when he greeted us or
repulsed by the eye guck that
would sometimes stain the
fur near the corner of his
eyes, but what I do know was

that that night I laughed
heartily for the first time in a
long while. Amused by my
friends' terror, I kept calling
to Finn to keep up as he and I
chased my friends down Es
condido Road.

That night was one of
many, many times that Finn
brought balance to my life.
From the way he would grin
when I would scratch the
base of his tail to the dance he
would perform at my feet as
he interwove his body be
tween my legs, Finn unfail
ingly brought me back to the
present when my mind was
paralyzed by anxiety of the
future. Now that he has
passed away, I cherish my
memories of Finnegan even
more now than before and
selfishly wish I could have
spent more time with him.
But, as many of his Stanford
friends know, Finn was a
wandering spirit with too
much love to give for just one
person.

times before that night, I was
excited to introduce my fe
line friend and to ask him to
walk us home. To my shock
and slight bemusement, my
friends were utterly terrified
of him! To this day I still
haven't figured out if they
were intimidated by his bold
ness when he greeted us or
repulsed by the eye guck that
would sometimes stain the
fur near the corner of his
eyes, but what I do know was

that that night I laughed
heartily for the first time in a
long while. Amused by my
friends' terror, I kept calling
to Finn to keep up as he and I
chased my friends down Es
condido Road.

That night was one of
many, many times that Finn
brought balance to my life.
From the way he would grin
when I would scratch the
base of his tail to the dance he
would perform at my feet as
he interwove his body be
tween my legs, Finn unfail
ingly brought me back to the
present when my mind was
paralyzed by anxiety of the
future. Now that he has
passed away, I cherish my
memories of Finnegan even
more now than before and
selfishly wish I could have
spent more time with him.
But, as many of his Stanford
friends know, Finn was a
wandering spirit with too
much love to give for just one
person.
