## Finn-anigans: memories of a beloved cat 
### Chelsey Sveinsson 
I remember clearly the first time
I met Finnegan my freshman
year. I was on my way to Wilbur
Dining Hall one day and right
smack in the middle of the patio out
side the dining hall was this beauti
ful black and white cat soaking up
the sunbeams.
As someone who has grown up
with dogs her whole life and has
many scars from friendly-looking
(key word: looking) cats, I hesitat
ed for maybe a total of five seconds
before slowly approaching this ma
jestic feline. Kneeling to the ground
at a safe distance from his claws, I
tried to catch his gaze to discern if
the glint in his eyes was inviting or

defiant. Failing to tap into my inner-
Dr. Doolittle and unable to resist my
urge to pet this furry feline, my
hand crept closer to his side, hyp
notically heaving in the sunlight.
As my fingertips gently im
mersed themselves into his soft fur,
my heart warmed with affection
that only pets can induce. I can
trust this one, I thought to myself.
Growing in confidence, I spent
several minutes stroking from head
to tail until I finally succumbed to
the persistent, nagging voice in my
head reminding me of the IHUM
reading waiting for me on my desk.
Getting up off the ground, I distinct
ly remember my knees aching from

kneeling and squatting so long but I
didn't mind the ache as much as I
did the depressing thought of not
running into this mysterious,
friendly cat again.
Little did I know that Finnegan
would not only be around but would
also be a source of support and com
fort for me my sophomore year,
when I felt defeated and lonely amid
the throes of the "sophomore
slump."
Sophomore year was by far the
worst year for me at Stanford. Be
tween taking 18-22 unit quarters,
trying not to drown in the Hum√üio
