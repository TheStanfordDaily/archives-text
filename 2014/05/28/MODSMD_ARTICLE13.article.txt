## Champions League final one to remember 
### Vignesh Venkataraman 
Atletico Madrid almost
pulled it off. They had
already won La Liga in
a manner most closely
resembling the psyche
of their squad, facing adversity at the
Camp Nou to a Barcelona squad des
perate to send off its golden genera
tion of players with one last title.
Falling behind early in its final league
match, Atletico seemed to grow looser
as the match progressed, dominating
the proceedings before finally seizing
the equalizing goal on a set piece, win
ning the league with an intense 1-1
draw against the reigning champions
in their own stadium.
Then, in the UEFA Champions
League final, they faced (arguably)
the most expensive team ever assem
bled in Real Madrid their intra-city
rivals, a team with the two most ex
pensive players in the history of the
world leading its attack, a team whose
bench could potentially win the World
Cup. Los Colchoneros 'The Mat
tresses' in Spanish, in homage to the
team's striped kit, which apparently
evokes images of old mattresses
played aggressive, flowing, and tacti
cally rigid soccer and seized an early
lead through a combination of tena
cious attacking play and a small but
not insignificant error from Iker
Casillas.
Casillas, the patron saint of Spanish
soccer as the longtime captain of both
Real Madrid and the Spanish national
team, failed to claim a ball that trickled
back into his penalty box. He could
only watch in horror as Diego Godin
pounced on the mistake and knocked
the ball into the back of the net.
With the lead secure, Atletico was
thoroughly content to play on the
counter, letting Real Madrid dictate
proceedings with the hope that a sin
gle bad giveaway would lead to a fruit
ful counterattack. Desperately chas
ing the equalizing goal, and with a shot
at winning La Decima (the 10th Euro
pean championship in Read Madrid
history), Los Blaneos Real Madrid
plays in all-white jerseys, hence their
nickname literally laid siege to
Thibault Courtois and the Atletico
goal, accumulating 20 total shots on
goal and a number of great chances.
And yet, as time ticked slowly for
ward, they could not summon the
killer instinct needed to finish off a sin
gle one of these chances. Cristiano
Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Karim Benze
ma, Luka Modric, Angel Di Maria,
Isco the star-studded Real Madrid
lineup, for all of its purported quality
could not find that elusive equalizer.
Ronaldo looked injured and Bale
looked panic-stricken; neither was
able to put his customary stamp on the
proceedings.
Deep, deep, deep into added time
nearly the fourth minute out of the
five that were to be added Real was
still trailing, watching their hopes of
La Decima slip away again as Atletico
were on the verge of the unlikeliest
double in recent memory.
Ironically, it was a defender —Ser-
gio Ramos —who stepped up to the
plate to deliver one of the clutchest
goals you will ever see, his kick arch
ing high above the fatigued, injured
and exhausted Atletico defense to
head home a corner goal that saved
Real's collective bacon. Ramos, known
for his physical defense, has now
scored six goals in seven Champions
League appearances this year, which
would be an impressive tally even for a
striker.

Backs broken after the heartbreak
of being less than a minute from the
greatest of victories, Atletico went
down meekly in extra time. Having al
ready lost Arda Trran, Diego Costa
and Filipe Luis to injuries and with the
wear and tear of a very long football
season catching up to the regulars on
their squad, Atletico could only watch
in stunned silence as first Bale, then
Marcelo, then finally Ronaldo from
the penalty spot piled home the decid
ing goals, leaving the final score de
ceptively set at 4-1 in favor of Real.
It is easy to write this one off as
deep pockets trumping the underdog,
but that would be unfair to both
squads. Atletico managed to dominate
the three-legged race in La Liga and
absolutely torched Barcelona,
Chelsea and everyone else they came
up against in the Champions League,
while Real Madrid, too, was beset by
injuries and had to overcome major
adversity (and Bayern Munich) to win
both the Copa del Rey and the Cham
pions League. In the end, all that sep
arated Atletico from the title and
the margin of Real Madrid's victory
—was a scant few inches and 30 sec
onds. The pure drama of this game

was truly spellbinding.
Unfortunately for Atletico, it
looks like this team, in the truest
sense of the word 'team', will not be
spending much time as an ensemble.
FVom Diego Costa, then- star striker,
to the rest of their list of stars, every
single one has been linked with a
move elsewhere. At the very least,
this team will need to lose a few key
contributors to cut into the massive
debt the club is trying to work off.
And that, truly, is the saddest result of
this Champions League outcome: the
sense of finality that this team will
never be given the opportunity to
avenge their loss on the same stage.
Meanwhile, for Real, the future
looks rosy. With another five years, at
least, of Ronaldo and Bale thundering
down the flanks, with Ramos and
Varane and Carvajal and Marcelo
turning away opposing attackers,
with Modric, Illaramendi, Khedira
and company manning the midfield,
this team will continue to compete for
trophies well into the future. With the
rest of European club football unset
tled, to say the least, la undecima
beckons.

Vignesh Venkataraman is still
mourning Atletico's loss and has
been dressed in all black since Sat
urday. Send your condolences to

League appearances this year, which
would be an impressive tally even for a
striker.

Backs broken after the heartbreak
of being less than a minute from the
greatest of victories, Atletico went
down meekly in extra time. Having al
ready lost Arda Trran, Diego Costa
and Filipe Luis to injuries and with the
wear and tear of a very long football
season catching up to the regulars on
their squad, Atletico could only watch
in stunned silence as first Bale, then
Marcelo, then finally Ronaldo from
the penalty spot piled home the decid
ing goals, leaving the final score de
ceptively set at 4-1 in favor of Real.
It is easy to write this one off as
deep pockets trumping the underdog,
but that would be unfair to both
squads. Atletico managed to dominate
the three-legged race in La Liga and
absolutely torched Barcelona,
Chelsea and everyone else they came
up against in the Champions League,
while Real Madrid, too, was beset by
injuries and had to overcome major
adversity (and Bayern Munich) to win
both the Copa del Rey and the Cham
pions League. In the end, all that sep
arated Atletico from the title and
the margin of Real Madrid's victory
—was a scant few inches and 30 sec
onds. The pure drama of this game

was truly spellbinding.
Unfortunately for Atletico, it
looks like this team, in the truest
sense of the word 'team', will not be
spending much time as an ensemble.
FVom Diego Costa, then- star striker,
to the rest of their list of stars, every
single one has been linked with a
move elsewhere. At the very least,
this team will need to lose a few key
contributors to cut into the massive
debt the club is trying to work off.
And that, truly, is the saddest result of
this Champions League outcome: the
sense of finality that this team will
never be given the opportunity to
avenge their loss on the same stage.
Meanwhile, for Real, the future
looks rosy. With another five years, at
least, of Ronaldo and Bale thundering
down the flanks, with Ramos and
Varane and Carvajal and Marcelo
turning away opposing attackers,
with Modric, Illaramendi, Khedira
and company manning the midfield,
this team will continue to compete for
trophies well into the future. With the
rest of European club football unset
tled, to say the least, la undecima
beckons.

Atletico Madrid almost
pulled it off. They had
already won La Liga in
a manner most closely
resembling the psyche
of their squad, facing adversity at the
Camp Nou to a Barcelona squad des
perate to send off its golden genera
tion of players with one last title.
Falling behind early in its final league
match, Atletico seemed to grow looser
as the match progressed, dominating
the proceedings before finally seizing
the equalizing goal on a set piece, win
ning the league with an intense 1-1
draw against the reigning champions
in their own stadium.
Then, in the UEFA Champions
League final, they faced (arguably)
the most expensive team ever assem
bled in Real Madrid their intra-city
rivals, a team with the two most ex
pensive players in the history of the
world leading its attack, a team whose
bench could potentially win the World
Cup. Los Colchoneros 'The Mat
tresses' in Spanish, in homage to the
team's striped kit, which apparently
evokes images of old mattresses
played aggressive, flowing, and tacti
cally rigid soccer and seized an early
lead through a combination of tena
cious attacking play and a small but
not insignificant error from Iker
Casillas.
Casillas, the patron saint of Spanish
soccer as the longtime captain of both
Real Madrid and the Spanish national
team, failed to claim a ball that trickled
back into his penalty box. He could
only watch in horror as Diego Godin
pounced on the mistake and knocked
the ball into the back of the net.
With the lead secure, Atletico was
thoroughly content to play on the
counter, letting Real Madrid dictate
proceedings with the hope that a sin
gle bad giveaway would lead to a fruit
ful counterattack. Desperately chas
ing the equalizing goal, and with a shot
at winning La Decima (the 10th Euro
pean championship in Read Madrid
history), Los Blaneos Real Madrid
plays in all-white jerseys, hence their
nickname literally laid siege to
Thibault Courtois and the Atletico
goal, accumulating 20 total shots on
goal and a number of great chances.
And yet, as time ticked slowly for
ward, they could not summon the
killer instinct needed to finish off a sin
gle one of these chances. Cristiano
Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Karim Benze
ma, Luka Modric, Angel Di Maria,
Isco the star-studded Real Madrid
lineup, for all of its purported quality
could not find that elusive equalizer.
Ronaldo looked injured and Bale
looked panic-stricken; neither was
able to put his customary stamp on the
proceedings.
Deep, deep, deep into added time
nearly the fourth minute out of the
five that were to be added Real was
still trailing, watching their hopes of
La Decima slip away again as Atletico
were on the verge of the unlikeliest
double in recent memory.
Ironically, it was a defender —Ser-
gio Ramos —who stepped up to the
plate to deliver one of the clutchest
goals you will ever see, his kick arch
ing high above the fatigued, injured
and exhausted Atletico defense to
head home a corner goal that saved
Real's collective bacon. Ramos, known
for his physical defense, has now
scored six goals in seven Champions
League appearances this year, which
would be an impressive tally even for a
striker.
