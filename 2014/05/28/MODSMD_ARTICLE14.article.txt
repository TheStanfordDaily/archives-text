# COWBOY CORRAL
## GOLF OUSTED IN 3-2 SEMIFINAL LOSS TO OKLAHOMA STATE 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
What a difference a day a few
hours, even can make. On Mon
day evening, the Stanford men's
golf team was elated, having just
earned the number-one seed for
Tuesday and Wednesday's match
play rounds at the NCAA finals.
They saw senior leader Cameron
Wilson capture the coveted individ
ual title in dramatic fashion and
sophomore David Boote use an ex
cellent final round to finish T-3rd.
One got a sense that maybe, just
maybe, this was their time. While
the joy was tempered by the fact
that there was still much golf to be
played, everything seemed to be
going the Cardinal's way, with the
players at the back-end of the lineup
showing real promise on the Perry
Maxwell-designed Prairie Dunes
Country Club being the most en
couraging sign.
Even at noon on Tuesday, by
which time the Card had defeated
eighth-seed Illinois in the match
play quarterfinals, the group still
had dreams of trophy hoisting.
Though they barely scraped by
against the Illini, Stanford had al
ready activated survive-and-ad
vance mode a win is a win is a
win, no matter how big or small. To
say they were relieved doesn't do
the gravity of the situation justice
after all, this was win or go home.
Those feelings did a complete
180-degree turn by Tuesday
evening, when the Card were close
ly ousted in the match play semifi
nals by Oklahoma State, losing ever
so slightly 3-2. Any hopes head
coach Conrad Ray and company
had of taking the program's first na
tional title since 2007 were crushed
in the most heartbreaking of ways, a
sobering fact that hurt even more
when considering the finality of the
collegiate careers of Wilson and
junior Patrick Rodgers.
The day began on a more posi
tive note for Stanford, when it dis
patched Illinois the 2013 NCAA

runners-up in the morning quar
terfinal 3-2. Ray sent Boote and
freshman Viraat Badhwar out in the
first two pairings, which the Cardi
nal split. Boote, who was 8-under
over the last 36 stroke play holes,
fell 1-down to the Illini's Thomas
Detry after being 1-up with two to
play. Badhwar made his move ver
sus Charlie Danielson brother of
Stanford women's golfer Casey
Danielson on 16 to win the match
1-up.
Fellow freshman Maverick Mc-
Nealy lost to Brian Campbell 3 and

2, while Rodgers won by the same
margin against Jonathan Hauter.
That left the two squads tied with
one paring remaining, which pitted
the individual champion Wilson
against Alex Burge. The duo stayed
close and went back and forth
throughout the round before Wil
son went 1-up on 17 and coolly sank
a par-putt on 18 to clinch the victory
for the Card.
That putt moved Stanford into
second of two afternoon semifinals
against Oklahoma State, a team
Stanford lost to in four of their five

tournament meetings this season.
Despite not having much tangible
success against the Cowboys in the
regular season, the Cardinal played
their opponent remarkably well
even through the first half of the
five matches. McNealy led off
against Tatar Gooch, with the two
trading blows and neither gaining
more than a 1-up advantage. Mc-
Nealy's par on 13 put him 1-up, a
lead he enjoyed until Gooch birdied
16 and 17. But Gooch's poor tee shot
on 18 left the door ajar for McNealy,
and he slipped through the crack
with a par to extend the round. But
Gooch slammed the gate shut a few
holes later, hitting a lengthy birdie
putt on the third extra hole, and Mc-
Nealy's miss sealed his fate.
At that point, Wilson had al
ready defeated lan Davis 4 and 2,
taking advantage of several errant
shots from the Cowboy down the
stretch to give Stanford its first
point. Likewise, Zachary Olsen had
felled Boote by the time the Mc-
Nealy-Gooch battle ended, and
OSU had a 2-1 lead.
Stanford's hopes now resided on
the clubs of Badhwar and Rodgers,
who were going in opposite direc
tions by the middle of their back
nines. The latter was slowly but
surely pulling away from Jordan
Niebrugge, with birdies on 13 and
14 and pars on 15,16 and 17 cement
ing his advantage. But Rodgers
would never see 18, because up
ahead, Badhwar was in serious
trouble. All-square with Wyndham
Clark after 10 holes, the New Delhi
native lost the next three holes, then
won the next two to put himself 1-
down with three to play. After
reaching the 18th green in two
strokes, Clark and Badhwar both
had chances at birdie. Clark missed
first, and Badhwar's follow-up just
missed the left lip of the cup, ending
Stanford's late rally and its season.
And while losses are always mul
tifactorial, the bottom line for the
Card is that they were simply un
able to get production from the
whole of their lineup against Okla
homa State. True to form, Wilson
and Rodgers did then* part at the
front, but Stanford's team depth
was its Achilles' heel, despite valiant
efforts from McNealy, Boote and

matches on Tuesday and the Cardinal fell in the semifinals to OSU.
Badhwar. The problem of the
3-4 hole followed Ray's unit
throughout the season but
was often mitigated by the
low rounds of its two fron
trunners. This time, Wilson
and Rodgers couldn't save
the team they helped build,

and the Card's seemingly
magical run at a team title
ended one step short at
Prairie Dunes.
This disappointment will
sting perhaps more than
Columbus in 2013. For the
outgoing Wilson and
Rodgers, this was their last
chance to fully redeem a pro
gram that has had superbly
talented players but also a
recent knack for underper
forming on the biggest

stages. Those two held up
their end of the bargain, but
their wins versus the Cow
boys went unreciprocated
by their younger team
mates. They were so close to
gaining the ultimate oppor
tunity, but it just wasn't
meant to be, and there's
nothing that can truly
smooth that over.
