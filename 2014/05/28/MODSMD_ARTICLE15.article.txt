# BASEBALL Q&A
## HUNTING THE HOOSIERS 
### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
In advance of Stanford baseball's up
coming NCAA regional in Bloomington,
Indiana, The Daily's Jordan Wallach chat
ted with Evan Hoopfer, a sports editor at
The Indiana Daily Student, to get perspec
tive 071 the Indiana Hoosiers, one of the
Cardinal's three opponents this weekend,

Jordan Wallach (JW): Last season, Indiana
ended a postseason drought and clinched its
first College World Series appearance in team
history. How did fans and students back in
Bloomington react to the team's postseason
run and how did their excitement manifest into
different expectations for this season?
Evan Hoopfer (EH): Bloomington is behind
this team. Crowds aren't very student heavy
though. Even though IU has had great atten

dance statistics this year, the students haven't
come out like they do for basketball or soccer.
Head coach Tracy Smith said that when they
built Bart Kaufman Field last year, he wanted
to become Bloomington's minor league fran
chise. And that is what I would compare it to
a minor league franchise.

Last season was pretty amazing wdth all the
"first time ever" things that were happening.
The Hoosiers weren't even ranked in their 118-
year history before last year. So expectations
are definitely raised with this team, especially
with all the top-tier talent on it. But honestly, it
seems like the fans are still in the honeymoon
phase. If IU doesn't make it back to Omaha,
sure, there will be some displeasure. But it will
be nothing like the vitriol and flat-out hatred
that the fans can have during basketball sea
son. Bloomington has essentially been a bas
ketball town in a basketball state since its in
ception. A good baseball team is something

new to them, I
and they are I
still enjoying I
it and learning I
the game of
baseball along
the way.

JW: After being ranked

No. 3 in the preseason, Indiana got off to a dis
appointing 12-10 start, but turned it around to
go 30-3 afterwards. What do you think was the
reason for the team's slow start out of the gate
and more importantly, how did the team turn it
around?
EH: I spoke to Smith after that loss to Indiana
State back on March 26 that dropped them to
12-10 and he said he told the team, "Well, you've
seen the light. It can't get worse than this." He

mentioned that he also told
his team that they had prob
ably played their way out of
a national seed, so they
might as well just get that off
their mind and start playing
baseball. After that rocky
start, [the team] rattled off
sweeps of Ohio State, lowa
and Michigan State and
started hitting their groove.
They didn't like having the
target on their back in the be
ginning of the season, and it
showed. Indiana baseball
isn't used to being in the na
tional spotlight. Plus, they
played a killer non-confer
ence schedule. That ability to
stop pressing and the ease of
the Big Ten compared to
their non-conference sched
ule allowed IU to go on this
tear that they are on right
now.
JW: In such a fast-paced re
gional where teams could po
tentially play five games in
four days, what is the current
state of Indiana's pitching
staff and how has its rotation
developed throughout the
season?
EH:The pitching staff is
nothing like it was in the be
ginning of the season, but it's
been historically good. Going
into the season their week
end rotation was Joey DeNa
to, Kyle Hart and Will
Coursen-Carr. DeNato has
been superb. He's 12-1 with a
1.77 ERA and just been
ridiculous. He's set the IU
career records in wins,

strikeouts and innings
pitched this season. But the
other starters aren't in the
weekend rotation anymore.
After winning back-to-back
Big Ten Pitcher of the Week
awards, Kyle Hart had
Tommy John surgery back in
the beginning of April. And
Will Coursen-Carr has gone
through some major confi
dence issues and just can't
find the strike zone anymore.
Filling in for them are
Christian Morris, who was
named first team All-Big
Ten, and Brian Korte, who is
3-0 with a 2.11E RA over 38.1
IE Smith said after practice
today that he will probably
hold DeNato until Saturday
to face the winner of Indiana
State-Stanford instead of
throwing him against
Youngstown State. So Smith
doesn't know exactly what
the rotation will be. But the
pitching staff has been in
sane. IU didn't allow a Big
Ten opponent this entire sea
son to score over four runs in
a game. That's 28 conference
games of allowing four runs
or under to opponents.

JW: What are Indiana's
other strengths and weak
nesses?
EH:With all that said about
the pitching staff, lU's
strength is their hitting.
Catcher Kyle Schwarber
and first baseman Sam
Travis will have their names
called in the MLB Draft
pretty soon. Schwarber is a
projected top-20 pick and
Travis just won Big Ten
Player of the Year and is list
ed as a top-100 prospect.
They are both heavy slug
gers. They are first- and sec

ond rank in the Big Ten in
homers Schwarber with
12 and Travis with 10. And
third baseman Dustin De-
Muth was drafted in the
ninth round last year by the
Twins but opted to come
back for his senior season.
He's more of a hit-for-aver
age guy, as he's leading the
Big Ten with a .381 average
this year and a .455 on-base
percentage. In total, six
Hoosiers in the starting line
up hit over .300. They can
outslug just about any team.
The low-scoring affairs
are where the team could po
tentially get caught up. The
Hoosiers' closer tandem of
Jake Kelzer and Scott Ef
fross has been great, but
they are a freshman and a
sophomore, respectively. All
time IU saves leader Ryan
Halstead went down with a
torn ACL on March 5, so
Kelzer and Effross have
taken over. I'd like to see the
young guys close in a pres
sure situation before I anoint
them the next Halstead.
That's the biggest potential
weakness I see in this team.

JW: How do you see the re
gional playing out for Indi
ana?
EH: I think this regional
shaped up real well for lU. I
would be surprised if they
didn't come away with a
sweep from this weekend.
Bart Kaufman will be rock
ing, and the weather is sup
posed to be pretty warm so
the bats should do just fine.
My prediction is a 3-0 week
end for the Hoosiers.

JW: In such a fast-paced re
gional where teams could po
tentially play five games in
four days, what is the current
state of Indiana's pitching
staff and how has its rotation
developed throughout the
season?
EH:The pitching staff is
nothing like it was in the be
ginning of the season, but it's
been historically good. Going
into the season their week
end rotation was Joey DeNa
to, Kyle Hart and Will
Coursen-Carr. DeNato has
been superb. He's 12-1 with a
1.77 ERA and just been
ridiculous. He's set the IU
career records in wins,

strikeouts and innings
pitched this season. But the
other starters aren't in the
weekend rotation anymore.
After winning back-to-back
Big Ten Pitcher of the Week
awards, Kyle Hart had
Tommy John surgery back in
the beginning of April. And
Will Coursen-Carr has gone
through some major confi
dence issues and just can't
find the strike zone anymore.
Filling in for them are
Christian Morris, who was
named first team All-Big
Ten, and Brian Korte, who is
3-0 with a 2.11E RA over 38.1
IE Smith said after practice
today that he will probably
hold DeNato until Saturday
to face the winner of Indiana
State-Stanford instead of
throwing him against
Youngstown State. So Smith
doesn't know exactly what
the rotation will be. But the
pitching staff has been in
sane. IU didn't allow a Big
Ten opponent this entire sea
son to score over four runs in
a game. That's 28 conference
games of allowing four runs
or under to opponents.

JW: What are Indiana's
other strengths and weak
nesses?
EH:With all that said about
the pitching staff, lU's
strength is their hitting.
Catcher Kyle Schwarber
and first baseman Sam
Travis will have their names
called in the MLB Draft
pretty soon. Schwarber is a
projected top-20 pick and
Travis just won Big Ten
Player of the Year and is list
ed as a top-100 prospect.
They are both heavy slug
gers. They are first- and sec

ond rank in the Big Ten in
homers Schwarber with
12 and Travis with 10. And
third baseman Dustin De-
Muth was drafted in the
ninth round last year by the
Twins but opted to come
back for his senior season.
He's more of a hit-for-aver
age guy, as he's leading the
Big Ten with a .381 average
this year and a .455 on-base
percentage. In total, six
Hoosiers in the starting line
up hit over .300. They can
outslug just about any team.
The low-scoring affairs
are where the team could po
tentially get caught up. The
Hoosiers' closer tandem of
Jake Kelzer and Scott Ef
fross has been great, but
they are a freshman and a
sophomore, respectively. All
time IU saves leader Ryan
Halstead went down with a
torn ACL on March 5, so
Kelzer and Effross have
taken over. I'd like to see the
young guys close in a pres
sure situation before I anoint
them the next Halstead.
That's the biggest potential
weakness I see in this team.

JW: How do you see the re
gional playing out for Indi
ana?
EH: I think this regional
shaped up real well for lU. I
would be surprised if they
didn't come away with a
sweep from this weekend.
Bart Kaufman will be rock
ing, and the weather is sup
posed to be pretty warm so
the bats should do just fine.
My prediction is a 3-0 week
end for the Hoosiers.

In advance of Stanford baseball's up
coming NCAA regional in Bloomington,
Indiana, The Daily's Jordan Wallach chat
ted with Evan Hoopfer, a sports editor at
The Indiana Daily Student, to get perspec
tive 071 the Indiana Hoosiers, one of the
Cardinal's three opponents this weekend,

Jordan Wallach (JW): Last season, Indiana
ended a postseason drought and clinched its
first College World Series appearance in team
history. How did fans and students back in
Bloomington react to the team's postseason
run and how did their excitement manifest into
different expectations for this season?
Evan Hoopfer (EH): Bloomington is behind
this team. Crowds aren't very student heavy
though. Even though IU has had great atten

dance statistics this year, the students haven't
come out like they do for basketball or soccer.
Head coach Tracy Smith said that when they
built Bart Kaufman Field last year, he wanted
to become Bloomington's minor league fran
chise. And that is what I would compare it to
a minor league franchise.

Last season was pretty amazing wdth all the
"first time ever" things that were happening.
The Hoosiers weren't even ranked in their 118-
year history before last year. So expectations
are definitely raised with this team, especially
with all the top-tier talent on it. But honestly, it
seems like the fans are still in the honeymoon
phase. If IU doesn't make it back to Omaha,
sure, there will be some displeasure. But it will
be nothing like the vitriol and flat-out hatred
that the fans can have during basketball sea
son. Bloomington has essentially been a bas
ketball town in a basketball state since its in
ception. A good baseball team is something

new to them, I
and they are I
still enjoying I
it and learning I
the game of
baseball along
the way.

JW: After being ranked

No. 3 in the preseason, Indiana got off to a dis
appointing 12-10 start, but turned it around to
go 30-3 afterwards. What do you think was the
reason for the team's slow start out of the gate
and more importantly, how did the team turn it
around?
EH: I spoke to Smith after that loss to Indiana
State back on March 26 that dropped them to
12-10 and he said he told the team, "Well, you've
seen the light. It can't get worse than this." He

mentioned that he also told
his team that they had prob
ably played their way out of
a national seed, so they
might as well just get that off
their mind and start playing
baseball. After that rocky
start, [the team] rattled off
sweeps of Ohio State, lowa
and Michigan State and
started hitting their groove.
They didn't like having the
target on their back in the be
ginning of the season, and it
showed. Indiana baseball
isn't used to being in the na
tional spotlight. Plus, they
played a killer non-confer
ence schedule. That ability to
stop pressing and the ease of
the Big Ten compared to
their non-conference sched
ule allowed IU to go on this
tear that they are on right
now.
