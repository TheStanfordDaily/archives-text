# BASEBALL Q&A
## HUNTING THE HOOSIERS 
### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
In advance of Stanford baseball's up
coming NCAA regional in Bloomington,
Indiana, The Daily's Jordan Wallach chat
ted with Evan Hoopfer, a sports editor at
The Indiana Daily Student, to get perspec
tive 071 the Indiana Hoosiers, one of the
Cardinal's three opponents this weekend,

Jordan Wallach (JW): Last season, Indiana
ended a postseason drought and clinched its
first College World Series appearance in team
history. How did fans and students back in
Bloomington react to the team's postseason
run and how did their excitement manifest into
different expectations for this season?
Evan Hoopfer (EH): Bloomington is behind
this team. Crowds aren't very student heavy
though. Even though IU has had great atten

dance statistics this year, the students haven't
come out like they do for basketball or soccer.
Head coach Tracy Smith said that when they
built Bart Kaufman Field last year, he wanted
to become Bloomington's minor league fran
chise. And that is what I would compare it to
a minor league franchise.

Last season was pretty amazing wdth all the
"first time ever" things that were happening.
The Hoosiers weren't even ranked in their 118-
year history before last year. So expectations
are definitely raised with this team, especially
with all the top-tier talent on it. But honestly, it
seems like the fans are still in the honeymoon
phase. If IU doesn't make it back to Omaha,
sure, there will be some displeasure. But it will
be nothing like the vitriol and flat-out hatred
that the fans can have during basketball sea
son. Bloomington has essentially been a bas
ketball town in a basketball state since its in
ception. A good baseball team is something

new to them, I
and they are I
still enjoying I
it and learning I
the game of
baseball along
the way.

JW: After being ranked

No. 3 in the preseason, Indiana got off to a dis
appointing 12-10 start, but turned it around to
go 30-3 afterwards. What do you think was the
reason for the team's slow start out of the gate
and more importantly, how did the team turn it
around?
EH: I spoke to Smith after that loss to Indiana
State back on March 26 that dropped them to
12-10 and he said he told the team, "Well, you've
seen the light. It can't get worse than this." He
