# WEDNESDAY ROUNDTABLE
## SCOUTING THE REGIONAL 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF BASEBALL WRITERS 
In the final Wednesday
roundtable of Vol. 24.6, we turn
to playoff-bound Stanford
baseball for a change of pace
and a, current topic. It was an
nounced on Monday that
Stanford would be heading to
the Bloomington Regional
with Indiana, Indiana State
and Youngstown State a their
competition, with the first
game coming against Indiana
State on Friday. We asked
baseball writers Jordan Wal
lach, Michael Peterson and
Vihan Lakshman: Whose con
tributions will be the most piv
otal in getting the Cardinal
past the Regional and into the
Super Regional ?

Michael: The key to winning
multiple games in a short period of

time in the playoffs will almost cer
tainly be the depth of the starting
pitching rotation and its ability to
pitch deep into games. The Cardi
nal could potentially play in as
many as five games in four days,
likely using five different starting
pitchers to get that job done. Their
two biggest adversaries in the re
gional, Indiana and Indiana State,
have potent lineups, as the
Hoosiers possess six batters who
hit over .310 during the regular
season and the Sycamores have a
balanced lineup that boasts seven
players hitting over .270.
In order to win games against
these teams, the starting pitchers
will need to eat up innings and keep
the opponents off the board early
to avoid depleting the bullpen dur
ing the packed stretch of games.
Fortunately for Stanford, this situ
ation seems perfect for the abun-

Junior John Hochstatter (above) will hope to give his team innings this
weekend in a packed regional schedule. He has excelled since joining
the starting rotation, going 7-0 with a 2.68 ERA over his seven starts.
dance of starting pitchers
that the Card have used this
season.

We know that freshman
Cal Quantrill can go toe-to
toe with any other starting
pitcher after finishing his
first regular season 5-5 with
a 2.92 ERA—and much of
that coming as the Friday
night starter. As of late, jun
ior John Hochstatter and
sophomore Logan James
have excelled in the rotation
as well, with their perform
ances playing a large role in
delivering Stanford to the
postseason. Hochstatter has
won all seven of his starts,
compiling a 2.68 ERA over
that span and throwing two
complete games. His ability
to go deep into games (aver
aging 7.2 innings per start)
will prove vital to Stanford's
postseason chances. Similar
ly, James has thrown seven
innings in back-to-back
starts, and has not allowed
more than two earned runs in
all five starts.

If needed, freshmen
Brett Hanewich and Chris
Viall are each equally pre
pared to start as well.
Hanewich started 13 games
and Viall also started eight
games this season, with both
pitchers beginning the sea
son in the starting rotation.
In his last outing in the final
home game of the season
against Pacific, Hanewich
threw a complete game and
only allowed two runs.
The starting rotation
proved to be the backbone of
the Cardinal for much of the
season, and it will need to
continue that if Stanford is to
advance to the Super Re
gional.

Jordan: While the Cardi
nal's confident starting pitch
ers can propel the team
through a marathon double
elimination tournament,
Stanford's offense has also
been key down the stretch
and can have a big impact
this weekend. Since April 13,

the team has gone 19-7 and a
rejuvenated offense has hit
for a .292 batting average.
Leading the charge and
poised to make key contribu
tions will be junior center
fielder Austin Slater. He has
been one of the Cardinal's
key storylines of the season,
as he has hit safely in 17 con
secutive games, the ninth
longest Stanford streak since
1988. Over that span, he has
hit .448 (30-for-67) with 15
RBIs, raising his season's
batting average to a team
leading .349.
Slater has consistently
been able to drive in runs as
well, as his 36 RBIs rank sec
ond behind senior third base
man Alex Blandino. In 18 op
portunities this season with
runners in scoring position
and less than two outs, he has
tallied 16 RBIs. Due to effi
ciency like this, Slater has
gained a stranglehold on the
cleanup spot in head coach
Mark Marquess's lineup since
the team's Arizona series.

Another Cardinal player
who has excelled this season
and has exploded of late is
sophomore right fielder Zach
Hoffpauir. The two-sport ex
traordinaire who also plays
free safety for David Shaw's
football squad started 51 of
the team's 53 games in 2014
after starting just four games
in the 2013 season. He has hit
safely in 14 of his last 15
games, and over his last 13
games, Hoffpauir has hit .520
(26-for-50) with three homers
and 13 RBIs. In that 13-game
span, he has improved his
batting average from .271 to
.339 and finished with a team
leading .522 slugging per
centage.
While the offense started
the season slowly, it gathered

momentum as hitters began
to step up by driving more
runners in instead of leaving
them stranded which was
certainly a problem early on.
The back-to-back combina
tion of Slater at cleanup and
Hoffpauir in the five-hole is
sure to give opposing pitch
ers trouble as they navigate
the Cardinal's lineup.

Vihan: I'm going to go
with the contributions of the
bullpen. Michael's assess
ment is absolutely-spot on:
Stanford starting pitchers
need to eat up innings to
avoid depleting the bullpen,
but the Cardinal relief pitch
ers will likely have to finish
the job. The third game of
Stanford's penultimate con
ference series with Washing
ton State immediately comes
to my mind as a time when
the bullpen failed to deliver in
a crucial game giving up
eight runs over two innings
and spoiling a solid outing by
starter Logan James.
On the season, Stanford's
bullpen has been inconsistent
at times, and the pressure
only mounts in the postsea
son as the final outs become
tougher to record. Senior A. J.
Yanegas, who led the team
with six saves, should provide
valuable leadership with his
postseason experience, earn
ing a spot on the 2012 Region
al All-Tournament Team.
Aside from Vanegas, reliev
ers Chris Castellanos, Mar
cus Brakeman, Sam
Lindquist and Tyler Thorne,
amongst others, will have to
step up and deliver against
some talented lineups in Indi
ana and Indiana State. If the
Card can get solid relief
pitching in the late innings,
they could surprise some
people and make a serious
run in the regional.

Michael Peterson, Jordan
Wallaeh and Vihan Laksh
man are thinking about mak
ing the trip to Bloamington,
just in case the Cardinal need
some extra arms over thefive
games-in-four-days stretch.

"The starting
pitchers will
need to eat
up innings."
