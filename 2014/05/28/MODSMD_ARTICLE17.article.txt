## Women's lightweight aims to defend titles at IRAs 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
Everything thus far has been in
preparation for one weekend. And
that weekend is finally here. The
Stanford women's lightweight crew
left early Sunday morning for West
Windsor, New Jersey, for the Inter
collegiate Rowing Association
(IRA) Championship Regatta, con
sidered to be the collegiate national
championship for rowing.
By Sunday, the lightweights will
know whether the five consecutive

first-place finishes that they have
earned thus far, including top finish
es at the PCRC Championships, Big
Row and WIRA Championship Re
gatta, truly indicate their domi
nance on the water.
"That's one of the best and worst
things about being on this team
we've been the national champions
for four years now and so there's a
lot of high expectations and all year
we are working to meet and exceed
those expectations as much as possi
ble," said sophomore Katherine
Christel.
Stanford will be one of nine light
weight varsity eights competing for
the IRA title and, most importantly,
will be seeking its fifth consecutive

national championship. Stanford
will also be fielding its varsity four,
which competed for the first time
this year at the PCRC Champi
onships and finished second in the
open field.
The team had three hard work
outs before heading east and has
been tapering since then, getting
mentally prepared for competition
and easing up on rigorous workouts
in order to be rested for the first two
races on Saturday. The Card have
had light training sessions at
Princeton all week and will continue
to adjust to the humidity and the
havoc it wreaks on their calloused
hands and the water conditions
of the East Coast.

The Stanford varsity eight light
weights will be joined by a field in
cluding Boston University, Buck
nell, Georgetown, MIT, Princeton,
Harvard-Radcliffe, Tulsa and Wis
consin. Last year, Stanford beat
Harvard-Radcliffe by open water,
coming in four seconds ahead. Al
though Stanford remains the heavy
favorite, Harvard-Radcliffe will
again be one of Stanford's top com
petitors this year.
The first two heats of competi
tion for both the varsity eight and
varsity four will be held on Saturday
with the Grand Finals on Sunday.
