## Memories of Finnegan the Rinconada cat 
### CHELSEY SVEINSSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Some brief anecdotes from students whose Stan
ford experience has been impacted by Finnegan, the
recently deceased Rinconada family cat:
"I met him one cold evening when he wouldn't stop me
owing outside my door, [wanting] to be let in. I figured
he was lost and someone must be missing him... He
made himself right at home by immediately racing up-

The cat was loved in the Stanford community and was
often seen wandering around campus.
stairs and burrowing into the
comforter on my bed. He was
sweet... His contented
purring formed the [back
ground music] to my paper
writing and he made me real
ize that I missed having a lov
ing pet waiting at home at the
end of a long, hard day."
Kiah Thorn 'l2 MA 'l3

"I was walking home late at
night down Mayfield, feeling
pretty crappy after a long
day and expecting a longer
night, and [Finn] was just sit
ting in the middle of the side
walk, almost as if he were
waiting for someone — and
[he] just got up and started
walking with me! At this
point I thought maybe he was
lost, even though cats don't
really get lost. So now I fol
lowed him, to make sure he'd
be alright. And he would stop
and let me pet him, then start
again. And then stop and
start. Until finally I realized
we were all the way in
Wilbur! This cat done
brought me home."

"Once, my friend and I were
walking by the basketball
court next to Kimball, and
Finn approached us with
something in his mouth.
When my friend and I got
closer, it turned out to be a
rabbit. Finn dropped the rab
bit at our feet, took a step
back and sat down. He was
looking at us, apparently
very proud of himself. Per
haps this was his gift to us
Kimballers to win back our
love."
— Toe Shin Lee '15
"I worked at Wilbur Front
Desk this past summer and
Finnegan used to stop in to
say hello all the time, meow
ing outside the doors until we
let him in. Some days, usually
in the morning, he'd come in
and sit on a swivel chair be
hind the desk for a couple
hours at a time. We used to
pretend he was our boss and
would ask him what he
thought we should do when
we had a problem."
