## Selections for Class of 2018 center around science theme 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
The three books for the 2014 Three
Books reading program were recently an
nounced: "Radioactive" by Lauren Red
niss, "My Year of Meats" by Ruth Ozeki
and "Physics for Future Presidents" by
Richard A. Muller.
Themed around "science and scien
tists," the books were selected by Physics
Professor Persis Drell, who was also
SLAC National Accelerator's director
from 2007 to October 2012. The books en
compass a range of writing styles and top
ics, from an artistic rendition of Marie
Curie's love story to a self-help book ex
plaining current issues related to science
to a novel expose of the meat industry.

"We live in a society dominated by tech
nology where scientific discoveries are
finding their way with remarkable speed
into our culture," Drell wrote in a letter ad
dressed to the Class of 2018 to be sent to
the students over the summer. "[ln] almost
all aspects of our daily lives... no matter
what life path you choose, being aware of
how science and scientists interact with so
ciety will be important to you."
Interestingly, Drell is also the first sci
entist since the program's inauguration to
be offered the opportunity to choose the
three books for the program.
"A considerable portion of our students
are interested in the sciences and it's about
time," said Robert Urstein, dean of fresh
men. "And I think it's great for students to
see that we might be focusing our attention

on what we do. But there are other parts of
our lives that are equally meaningful and
rich, and part of that includes story and
narrative, and you can find that in litera
ture and science and philosophy."
According to Drell, she was contacted
by Vice Provost of Undergraduate Educa
tion Harry Elam in late July to select the
books, and she noted that it was a tremen
dous responsibility as well as an honor.
"In October, November, I was strug
gling with what would be the right three
books, what books students would be at
tracted to and tempted to read," Drell said.
"Even if they aren't going to read it cover
to cover, at least they would be interested
in reading one or two books cover to cover
