# Three Books announced
## Selections for Class of 2018 center around science theme 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
The three books for the 2014 Three
Books reading program were recently an
nounced: "Radioactive" by Lauren Red
niss, "My Year of Meats" by Ruth Ozeki
and "Physics for Future Presidents" by
Richard A. Muller.
Themed around "science and scien
tists," the books were selected by Physics
Professor Persis Drell, who was also
SLAC National Accelerator's director
from 2007 to October 2012. The books en
compass a range of writing styles and top
ics, from an artistic rendition of Marie
Curie's love story to a self-help book ex
plaining current issues related to science
to a novel expose of the meat industry.

"We live in a society dominated by tech
nology where scientific discoveries are
finding their way with remarkable speed
into our culture," Drell wrote in a letter ad
dressed to the Class of 2018 to be sent to
the students over the summer. "[ln] almost
all aspects of our daily lives... no matter
what life path you choose, being aware of
how science and scientists interact with so
ciety will be important to you."
Interestingly, Drell is also the first sci
entist since the program's inauguration to
be offered the opportunity to choose the
three books for the program.
"A considerable portion of our students
are interested in the sciences and it's about
time," said Robert Urstein, dean of fresh
men. "And I think it's great for students to
see that we might be focusing our attention

on what we do. But there are other parts of
our lives that are equally meaningful and
rich, and part of that includes story and
narrative, and you can find that in litera
ture and science and philosophy."
According to Drell, she was contacted
by Vice Provost of Undergraduate Educa
tion Harry Elam in late July to select the
books, and she noted that it was a tremen
dous responsibility as well as an honor.
"In October, November, I was strug
gling with what would be the right three
books, what books students would be at
tracted to and tempted to read," Drell said.
"Even if they aren't going to read it cover
to cover, at least they would be interested
in reading one or two books cover to cover
and grazing the third."
Drell knew from the be
ginning that she wanted sci
ence to be the theme but had
difficulty gauging what would
be both fun and attractive for
a diverse group of students.
In order to better understand
how incoming students would
react to her choices, Drell

called for student feedback in
mid-November by asking
Twain residents about their
experiences with the three
books for their year.
"What stuck out in their
comments and considerations
was that they liked 'Physics
for Fixture Presidents,'" Drell
said. 'And when I presented
'Radioactive,' they wanted a
novel, and through the com
ments it looked like a coming
of age book was important for
the students... a novel that de
scribed someone maybe close

enough to their age or where
they are in their lives and deal
ing with some of the issues
that they're dealing with."
Drell hopes that students
from all backgrounds and
fields of interest will find sig
nificance in the various types
of science communication
these books provide.

"For the students who
don't come in with a particu
lar interest in science, I would
hope they would take away a
sense of how science and
technology are important in

their lives and part of being
educated is being engaged
with important issues," she
said. "And for the scientists, [I
hope] they would take away a
strong sense of the impor
tance of being responsible
about your science and com
municating about your sci
ence, both the tremendous
benefits it brings to society
but also the associated risks it
brings to society."

Drell knew from the be
ginning that she wanted sci
ence to be the theme but had
difficulty gauging what would
be both fun and attractive for
a diverse group of students.
In order to better understand
how incoming students would
react to her choices, Drell

called for student feedback in
mid-November by asking
Twain residents about their
experiences with the three
books for their year.
"What stuck out in their
comments and considerations
was that they liked 'Physics
for Fixture Presidents,'" Drell
said. 'And when I presented
'Radioactive,' they wanted a
novel, and through the com
ments it looked like a coming
of age book was important for
the students... a novel that de
scribed someone maybe close

enough to their age or where
they are in their lives and deal
ing with some of the issues
that they're dealing with."
Drell hopes that students
from all backgrounds and
fields of interest will find sig
nificance in the various types
of science communication
these books provide.

"For the students who
don't come in with a particu
lar interest in science, I would
hope they would take away a
sense of how science and
technology are important in

their lives and part of being
educated is being engaged
with important issues," she
said. "And for the scientists, [I
hope] they would take away a
strong sense of the impor
tance of being responsible
about your science and com
municating about your sci
ence, both the tremendous
benefits it brings to society
but also the associated risks it
brings to society."

The books for the incoming Class of 2018 were selected by Professor of Physics Persis Drell, who this year became the first
scientist to select readings forthe Three Books program. Drell knew from the start that she wanted to focus on the sciences.
