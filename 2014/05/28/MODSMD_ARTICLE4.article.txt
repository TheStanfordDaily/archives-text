## Senate discusses bills pertaining to funding 
### PETER MOON DEPUTY DESK EDITOR 
The 16th Undergraduate Senate
convened Tuesday night for its fifth
and final meeting of the spring quar
ter. The Senate discussed two bills on
the floor, both authored by the finan
cial manager and assistant managers
of Stanford Student Enterprises
(SSE).
The first bill regarded the cre
ation of an Association Joint Legisla
tive Committee on buffer fund expen
diture policies. The bill, which re
quires majority approval from both
the Undergraduate Senate and Grad
uate Student Council (GSC), passed
Tuesday in the Senate.
According to the bill, the Joint
Legislative Committee will be creat
ed for several reasons: to review past

expenditures, to evaluate the size of
the buffer funds and to redefine fis
cally responsible policies that are
considered appropriate.
The joint legislative committee
can only recommend policies to both
the undergraduate ASSU and the
GSC.
Assistant Financial Manager
Olivia Moore 'l6 discussed the bill
with the GSC, who positively re
sponded to the bill.
Parliamentarian John-Lancaster
Finley 'l6 was voted onto this com
mittee by other Senators, and he will
serve alongside Appropriations Com
mittee Chair Jackson Beard 'l7 as
well as the chair of the funding com
mittee from the GSC. In addition,
Frederik Groce, the ASSU Financial
Manager for 2014-15, and an
other senator from the GSC
will be serving as committee
members.
The second bill concerned
the establishment of new un
dergraduate general fees
policies. The bill puts a
$lOO,OOO cap on general fees
allocations for fall quarter;

the cap will be removed if the
Senate establishes new gen
eral fees policies.
However, many Senators
felt this was an unnecessary
restriction. During the sum
mer, Beard, along with few
other senators, will be devis
ing a new general fees fund
ing system before the begin
ning of 2014-15 academic
year.
"The debate was over
whether or not it was neces
sary to put a cap in our
selves," said Chair Ben Hol

ston 'l5. "The prevailing sen
timent seemed to be that
there will be a new general
fees policy created before fall
quarter."
The bill failed to pass in
the Senate on Tuesday. How
ever, if the Senate does not
come up with a new general
fees funding plan which is
highly unlikely itself Hol
ston plans to reintroduce the
bill during fall quarter.
