# FUELING THE MACHINE
## LANCE ANDERSON AND REINVENTING THE CARDINAL RECRUITING GAME 
### WINSTON SHI MANAGING EDITOR 
This is the first piece in a three-part
feature this week on Lance Anderson,
Stanford football's defensive coordi
nator and, ace recruiter, who is now
entering his eighth season with Stan
ford football. Part, I focuses on Ander
son's reshaping of Stanford's recruit
ing apparatus. Stay tuned for Part 11,
which will cover Anderson's leader
ship of the defense, and part 111, which
will cover Anderson's life as a college
coach.

Three coaches remain from the
staff that initially accompanied
Jim Harbaugh to Stanford in
December 2006: David Shaw,
Shannon Turley and Lance An
derson.
Shaw rose from offensive coordinator to
head coach and won the next two Pac-12
Coach of the Year awards. Turley slashed
Stanford's injury rates and was voted the
best strength coach in the country last No
vember by the National Strength and Con
ditioning Association. Anderson, Stanford's
new defensive coordinator and ace re
cruiter, has flown under the radar for a long
time, but his successes are fundamental to
the program, and even for people only tan

gentially acquainted to the program, the re
sponsibilities that have come with his new
title have made him impossible to ignore.
This is the story of Stanford's rise of a
university that learned to sell itself like no
other. It's the story of a team and program
that has surpassed the legend of the people
that brought it back to prominence. It's also
the story of one of the best recruiters in
America.

College football is a deceptively deter
ministic sport. For a game that is so cele
brated for its spectacular upsets, its thrilling
victories and, of course, the coaches roaming
the sidelines, it's surprising if not outright
counterintuitive that so much of the game is
dependent upon recruiting, an aspect of the
game that few people ever get to see.
The numbers bear this out. A compre
hensive study of the 2012 college football
season by statistician Dave Bartoo found
that 76.5 percent of college football games in
the BCS Automatic Qualifier conferences
could be predicted six months before the
season even began, just by analyzing histor
ical recruiting rankings and correcting for
home-field advantage. Moreover, recruiting
is traditionally been range-bound: teams
rarely make massive leaps in that field.
"People don't want to admit this, but
most teams are as good as they'll ever be
right now," Bartoo said. And the hard truth
is that for a good part of Stanford's history,
its losses were decided before the game even
began.
While Bartoo was very complimentary of
Stanford's current coaches comparing
recruiting-based expected win totals to per
formance on the field, the Cardinal's entire
program adds approximately two wins a
year to Stanford's record it is clear, both
from his perspective and from the numbers,
that improved recruiting is the biggest rea
son why Stanford went from 1-11 to 12-1 in
just four short years.
Recruiting rankings are not always per
fect; Dallas Cowboys defensive end Ben
Gardner, a two-star prospect, caught Stan
ford's eye not with his star rating but from a
recommendation by Jim Harbaugh's dad.
But overall, the rankings are a solid predic
tor of future success. From 2003 to 2008, re
cruiting news service Scout.com ranked
Stanford's recruiting classes Nos. 26,46,38,
38, 43 and 44. After the program started
showing sustained progress during the fall
of2ooB, Stanford's classes were ranked Nos.
