# FUELING THE MACHINE
## LANCE ANDERSON AND REINVENTING THE CARDINAL RECRUITING GAME 
### WINSTON SHI MANAGING EDITOR 
This is the first piece in a three-part
feature this week on Lance Anderson,
Stanford football's defensive coordi
nator and, ace recruiter, who is now
entering his eighth season with Stan
ford football. Part, I focuses on Ander
son's reshaping of Stanford's recruit
ing apparatus. Stay tuned for Part 11,
which will cover Anderson's leader
ship of the defense, and part 111, which
will cover Anderson's life as a college
coach.

Three coaches remain from the
staff that initially accompanied
Jim Harbaugh to Stanford in
December 2006: David Shaw,
Shannon Turley and Lance An
derson.
Shaw rose from offensive coordinator to
head coach and won the next two Pac-12
Coach of the Year awards. Turley slashed
Stanford's injury rates and was voted the
best strength coach in the country last No
vember by the National Strength and Con
ditioning Association. Anderson, Stanford's
new defensive coordinator and ace re
cruiter, has flown under the radar for a long
time, but his successes are fundamental to
the program, and even for people only tan

gentially acquainted to the program, the re
sponsibilities that have come with his new
title have made him impossible to ignore.
This is the story of Stanford's rise of a
university that learned to sell itself like no
other. It's the story of a team and program
that has surpassed the legend of the people
that brought it back to prominence. It's also
the story of one of the best recruiters in
America.

College football is a deceptively deter
ministic sport. For a game that is so cele
brated for its spectacular upsets, its thrilling
victories and, of course, the coaches roaming
the sidelines, it's surprising if not outright
counterintuitive that so much of the game is
dependent upon recruiting, an aspect of the
game that few people ever get to see.
The numbers bear this out. A compre
hensive study of the 2012 college football
season by statistician Dave Bartoo found
that 76.5 percent of college football games in
the BCS Automatic Qualifier conferences
could be predicted six months before the
season even began, just by analyzing histor
ical recruiting rankings and correcting for
home-field advantage. Moreover, recruiting
is traditionally been range-bound: teams
rarely make massive leaps in that field.
"People don't want to admit this, but
most teams are as good as they'll ever be
right now," Bartoo said. And the hard truth
is that for a good part of Stanford's history,
its losses were decided before the game even
began.
While Bartoo was very complimentary of
Stanford's current coaches comparing
recruiting-based expected win totals to per
formance on the field, the Cardinal's entire
program adds approximately two wins a
year to Stanford's record it is clear, both
from his perspective and from the numbers,
that improved recruiting is the biggest rea
son why Stanford went from 1-11 to 12-1 in
just four short years.
Recruiting rankings are not always per
fect; Dallas Cowboys defensive end Ben
Gardner, a two-star prospect, caught Stan
ford's eye not with his star rating but from a
recommendation by Jim Harbaugh's dad.
But overall, the rankings are a solid predic
tor of future success. From 2003 to 2008, re
cruiting news service Scout.com ranked
Stanford's recruiting classes Nos. 26,46,38,
38, 43 and 44. After the program started
showing sustained progress during the fall
of2ooB, Stanford's classes were ranked Nos.

Defensive coordinator Lance Anderson (above) was the outside linebackers coach under
the now-departed Derek Mason before he was promoted to Mason's vacated position.
16,24,23,7,57 and 16.
Translating recruit-speak
to English, during the first
period, Stanford's recruiting
was only good for somewhere
around eighth in a 10-team
league. During the latter pe
riod, Stanford has been the
fourth-best recruiter in the
Pac-12, despite its famous (or
infamous) academic require
ments for recruits.
"They've had some big
classes, but it's sustaining it
self— that's what's amaz
ing," Bartoo says. The Cardi
nal have been top-two re
cruiters in the conference two
out of the last three years,
and have actually surpassed
Oregon in recruiting
prowess. It's no surprise that
in 2012, Scout named Ander
son its national recruiter of
the year.

"The key guy is Lance An
derson in all of this, above
everybody in my opinion,"
Harbaugh told The Daily in
an interview for the book
Rags to Roses last spring.
"He is the one consistent
thread for six years."
In person, it's clear that
Anderson can get a guy to go
to Stanford and, perhaps
more importantly, get the re
cruit's parents on board as
well. Lance Anderson has the
rare talent of making people
like him almost instantly. He
is smart, he is charismatic
and he has a compelling abili
ty to put people at ease; in
short, he resembles the ar
chetypal American cool uncle.
Naturally, he has all the
tangible successes you would
expect from an ace recruiter:
In just one year, Anderson led
the way in recruitments of
highly touted players like An
drus Peat, Aziz Shittu, Noor
Davis, Blake Martinez, Zach
Hoffpauir and Luke Kaumat
ule players that between
them had offers from nearly
every major program in the
country
But Anderson's greatest
achievements have been
strategic rather than tactical.
Put simply, Anderson has
changed the very science of
how Stanford approaches re
cruiting.
Over the last seven years,
Anderson has focused the
program on targeting players
in a more nuanced manner.
Stanford's recruiting had
never been focused on a sin
gle coach in the past Tavita
Pritchard 'O9, a quarterback
at Stanford when Anderson
arrived on campus, was re
cruited by Buddy Teevens,
played his first two seasons
under Walt Harris and be
came Stanford's starting
quarterback under Har
baugh— and even though a
flashy guy like Harbaugh
could play an important role
in recruiting, the emphasis
would always be on what
Stanford itself could offer,
and how best to market that
to students.

In addition to furiously
selling Stanford to recruits
across the country, Anderson
worked hard to advertise the
Stanford program, proactive
ly contact potential recruits,
help them negotiate the Stan
ford admissions office and
work with them to write the
best application possible.
The first part was market
ing: Early on, Stanford essen
tially carpet-bombed
prospective recruits with
non-committable offers (be

fore they had actually been
approved by the admissions
office), just to get the Cardi
nal into the conversation.

As Stanford improved on
the field, recruiting shifted
toward a more selective strat
egy. Stanford's advertising
emphasized the team's suc
cess in tandem with the Uni
versity's academic reputa
tion. A well-known letter to
recruits cleverly touted both
the Cardinal program and the
earning potential of a Stan
ford degree, pointing out that
Stanford outpaced the rest of
the football top 25 in gradu
ates' expected future salary.
Leveraging the Universi
ty's other built-in advantages
was a key prong of Stanford's
success. Anderson was confi
dent that Stanford could, in
short, sell itself if recruits
visited the campus, especial
ly during the beautiful Cali
fornia summer.

"I was just going through
the roster the last week," An
derson told The Daily for
Rags to Roses last year, after
Stanford inked another star
studded recruiting class. "Al
most everybody on our ros
ter is a guy that visited... the
summer their junior year or
sometime before."
As his colleague Mike Eu
banks put it for the same
project, "If they visit, they
will come."
But the big issue, as it had
always been, was navigating
the admissions office. Since
the days of Pop Warner,
Stanford coaches have wor
ried about admissions stan
dards. Anderson tried to un
derstand the process by put
ting himself in an admissions
officer's shoes.
"After being here just a
short time, we started to get
kids denied or we found
about a couple kids who had
already been denied right
before we got here, and it
was really interesting look
ing into that why some of
those kids were denied and
what the situation was," An
derson said. "Really, going
through that first recruiting
class, it really became evi
dent to me that, boy it's im
portant to get on kids early
and make sure they under
stand what all the academic
requirements are, in terms
of the classes we're looking
for them to take, the kind of

test scores we're looking for.
"There's not a magic
number [where] okay, they
get to this, and they're going
to get in," Anderson contin
ued. "[The admissions office
is] also gonna put a lot of
weight on your application.
How well did you write the
essays, how detailed and
thorough were you in filling
everything else out, what did
your teacher recommenda
tions say about you, what did
that counselor or score re
port, what did that say about
you?"

What did that say
about you? Indeed, going
beyond the measurables
SAT scores, 40-yard dash,
GPA, three-cone drill was
a view that both coaches and
admissions officers could get
behind.
Stanford football suc
ceeded by its working with
the admissions office. While
academic requirements did
restrict Stanford's pool of
potential recruits, Anderson
actually credits the admis
sions process, as well as the
team's strength and condi
tioning regimen, with help
ing Stanford's attrition
rates. Every Division I FBS
team gets 85 scholarships a
year; in a five-year stretch

from 2008 to 2012, Stanford
only signed 102 players. Dur
ing that time frame, Ala
bama signed 135. Additional
ly, having to sign fewer re
cruits also depresses recruit
ing rankings concealing
how talented Stanford's ros
ter really is.
"[The admissions offi
cers] want to make sure that
the kids who are admitted
here ... are able to be suc
cessful here. Not just get by,
not just survive, but that
they are able to succeed
here," Anderson said recent
ly. "You [might] think by re
laxing standards we can get
better players and stuff in,
but in the long term that's
going to hurt you, because
those guys are going to have
a hard time graduating."
Indeed, recruiting stan
dards that were not com
mensurate with a school's
high academic standards led
to Cal football graduating a
miserable 47 percent of play
ers within six years. Stan
ford escaped that fate.
"Lance realized we're not
gonna change admissions
here. He knew we need to
change what we do, and that
the key is to work with ad
missions," David Shaw told
CBS. "Lance was the first
one to realize and put that
road map together."

In recent years, when you

think of Stanford football,
you think of Jim Harbaugh,
who raged on the sidelines
and subjected the team to
endless viewings of The
Ghost and the Darkness-,
you think of David Shaw,
whose presence permeates
everything from the halls of
TEDx to the Stanford Stadi
um video board; you think of
a series of wisecracking,
hard-hitting, trash-talking
playmakers at almost every
position on the field.
The achievement of the
modern Stanford football
program is not really its re
cruiting classes or its super
stars or even its trophies. It
is a kind of culture change
but not just the idea that
Stanford players needed to
be tougher or leaner or
meaner. Stanford has re
cruited to the point that,
while individuals will always
be important to the program,
they do not necessarily de
fine it.
The history of Cardinal
football has been that of a
never-ending series of per
sonalities. You have your
Ernie Neverses, your Jim
Plunketts and your John El
ways. You have your Toby
Gerharts and your Andrew
Lucks. Force of personality
goes a long way toward es
tablishing a legend: At Stan
ford's lowest points, it must
have seemed that only some

Hegelian man-god could
have rallied the Cardinal to a
bowl game. Top-end talent
has always been here, not
that it necessarily propelled
the Cardinal to greatness; as
sportswriter Ivan Maisel 'Bl
pointedly commented on
Twitter, the 1980 Stanford
team had three College Foot
ball Hall of Famers and went
6-5.
The extraordinary part of
Stanford's rise is that finally,
Stanford's silverware seems
to be outpacing the faces that
generated it. You know the
story by now: four straight
BCS bowls, two conference
championships and a Rose
Bowl victory to cap off the
2012 season.
The season is long, and in
2013, Stanford survived a se
ries of devastating injuries
along the defensive line that
would have destroyed its sea
son in years past. Arriving on
campus in 2006, Anderson re
alized that even after a 1-11
season, "we had some good,
talented kids on the roster."
But now, there is not only star
power on the Farm, but
depth as well.
If Lance Anderson never
coaches another day in his
life, he can rest assured of the
fact that he was an integral
part of that ascent.

But Lance Anderson does
intend to keep on coaching.

One question remains, then,
and it is a more personal one.
Can a coach succeed if he
is viewed first as a recruiter?
People do not focus on
how, in his role as outside line
backers coach, Anderson has
mentored some of the most
devastating pass rushers in
America chief among
them, Trent Murphy and
Chase Thomas. And people
also too often pass over the
fact that Anderson has had
experience coordinating a de
fense in the past —at St.
Mary's, just an hour away
from Stanford. Coaches are
known for what they suppos
edly do best, and Lance An
derson's recruiting prowess
has overshadowed every
other aspect of his coaching
life.
Balancing recruiting and
coaching absorbs every col
lege football coach's profes
sional life. Recruiting talent
without training that talent
leads to disaster; coaching up
players that nevertheless do
not belong on the field athlet
ically with the USCs of the
world would have a similar ef
fect. There are only 24 hours
in a day, and every second in
the office recruiting is a sec
ond not spent coaching, cut
ting up film or getting to
know the player. Now that
Anderson is the gatekeeper
for Stanford's defense as well
as its admissions office, he's
more cognizant of this strug
gle than ever before.
Will Anderson ever be
able to reach his full potential
as a coach if most of his time is
spent recruiting? He is eager
to talk about football, and
while he is enthusiastic and
courteous about recruiting,
he clearly does not think
about it all the time. It is as if
he has already heard all the
recruiting questions before
and he probably has.
He looks at a prospect's
transcript on his desk.
"One of the things I've
been really involved with
since I've been here have
been the transcripts. I'm try
ing to do less and less of that.
He smiles, a little sheep
ishly. "But there's always a
little bit of time involved."
