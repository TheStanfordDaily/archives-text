# Q&A SHELLEY CORRELL
## PROFESSOR IN SOCIOLOGY AND DIRECTOR OF THE CLAYMAN INSTITUTE 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
The Clayman Institute for Gender Research
opened its new Women's Leadership Center last
Wednesday. The new center, led by Shelley Cor
rell, Stanford professor in sociology and director
of the Clayman Institute, aims to empower the un
derrepresented voices of women in the workplace
and promote women's leadership in business, gov
ernment and education.
The Daily sat down with Correll to discuss the
ongoing and future projects of the new leadership
center as well as her personal aspirations and
goals with the center's launch.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): [Could you] provide a
more concrete idea of what the center is meant to
do, whether that involves connecting women to op
portunities or advocating for female representa
tion in the workplace?
Shelley Correll (SC): The number-one goal is to
increase representation of women in leadership.
Our way of achieving that [is] working on three
core things. One is empowering women. We run
quite a few leadership programs in order to do so
aiready. The second thing we're doing is recruiting
men. What you see in the corporate world more
and more is that men want to play a role in empow
ering women. And the third thing that we're doing
is figuring out what workspaces or universities can
do to increase the involvement of women and men
in these issues.
TSD: The Corporate Partnership Program is
going to involve recruiting various companies to
partner with the center. How is a collaboration
with these corporations going to make a differ
ence?
SC: One of the really important goals of the center
is to bridge the gap between academic scholarship
and actual workplace practices. We have very
good scholarship on women's leadership on diver
sity and exclusion actually a lot of which was
developed at Stanford and we have a lot of cor
porations with that goal in mind but [these two
sides] haven't really been talking much. So the
idea is: Let's brings these two groups together
the academics and the workplaces and really
try to bridge the gap between them.
TSD: How large a role will the University play
with the center's projects?
SC: The Stanford community is certainly a part of
the academic side of bridging that gap. We have
several faculty members on the advisory board for
the center, and we have post-doctoral fellows
working at the center as well, and so there's a lot
of the Stanford representation. The other thing I'll
say is that we've been doing a lot of work on how
