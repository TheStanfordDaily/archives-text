# Q&A SHELLEY CORRELL
## PROFESSOR IN SOCIOLOGY AND DIRECTOR OF THE CLAYMAN INSTITUTE 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
The Clayman Institute for Gender Research
opened its new Women's Leadership Center last
Wednesday. The new center, led by Shelley Cor
rell, Stanford professor in sociology and director
of the Clayman Institute, aims to empower the un
derrepresented voices of women in the workplace
and promote women's leadership in business, gov
ernment and education.
The Daily sat down with Correll to discuss the
ongoing and future projects of the new leadership
center as well as her personal aspirations and
goals with the center's launch.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): [Could you] provide a
more concrete idea of what the center is meant to
do, whether that involves connecting women to op
portunities or advocating for female representa
tion in the workplace?
Shelley Correll (SC): The number-one goal is to
increase representation of women in leadership.
Our way of achieving that [is] working on three
core things. One is empowering women. We run
quite a few leadership programs in order to do so
aiready. The second thing we're doing is recruiting
men. What you see in the corporate world more
and more is that men want to play a role in empow
ering women. And the third thing that we're doing
is figuring out what workspaces or universities can
do to increase the involvement of women and men
in these issues.
TSD: The Corporate Partnership Program is
going to involve recruiting various companies to
partner with the center. How is a collaboration
with these corporations going to make a differ
ence?
SC: One of the really important goals of the center
is to bridge the gap between academic scholarship
and actual workplace practices. We have very
good scholarship on women's leadership on diver
sity and exclusion actually a lot of which was
developed at Stanford and we have a lot of cor
porations with that goal in mind but [these two
sides] haven't really been talking much. So the
idea is: Let's brings these two groups together
the academics and the workplaces and really
try to bridge the gap between them.
TSD: How large a role will the University play
with the center's projects?
SC: The Stanford community is certainly a part of
the academic side of bridging that gap. We have
several faculty members on the advisory board for
the center, and we have post-doctoral fellows
working at the center as well, and so there's a lot
of the Stanford representation. The other thing I'll
say is that we've been doing a lot of work on how


Courtesy of Shelley Correll
we can improve women's
leadership on campus as
well. A lot of the things that
we're learning are how to
make diversity and exclusion
work better, which can also
be lessons that we can bring
to the Stanford community
as well. Stanford does a won
derful job getting a diverse
undergraduate student pop
ulation, but [we] can do more
when it comes to faculty.

TSD: With the official launch
[having happened on
Wednesday], what are the
next steps that the center
will be taking to forward
your goals?
SC: We have [several] re
search projects where we're
trying to better understand
what works in terms of ad
vancing women leaders and
creating active organiza
tions. We're also expanding
the kinds of training that we
have available and the audi
ence to which those [pro
grams] are directed. We're
really just trying to expand
[our] curriculum to reach as
many people as possible and
evaluating if people are
learning and applying it.

TSD: Do you have any per
sonal goals for the center,
and if so, what are they?
SC: Yeah I do actually. I have
been a professor here since
2001, for 13 years. My re
search over that time has fo
cused a lot on the barriers of
women's advancement. I've
learned a lot about what puts
them down. When I became a
professor, women occupied
about 14 percent of leader
ship positions, and now it's

about 15 [or] 17 percent.
With that rate of change,
we're not getting there any
time soon. I'm no longer pa
tient enough to deal with that
slow rate of change. For me
personally, it's about moving
on that knowledge, collabo
rating with other scholars
and incorporating folks to
work on these issues.
It's an academic goal for
me but it's also something
that I'm looking forward to in
my career this is where I
want to make a mark.

TSD: Is the Center address
ing the queer population at
all?
SC: We actually are. Even
though it's a center directed
towards women leadership,
what you find when you start
uncovering obstacles is that
we start finding all kinds of
obstacles for all kinds of
groups and all different
kinds of women. The issues
that affect a heterosexual
woman with three kids are
not going to be the same is
sues that a young lesbian will
face as she starts her first
job. So we need to under
stand both [how] the things
that commonly help people
fit into work [operate] and
also understand the way that
diversity works differently
across different groups.

that affect a heterosexual
woman with three kids are
not going to be the same is
sues that a young lesbian will
face as she starts her first
job. So we need to under
stand both [how] the things
that commonly help people
fit into work [operate] and
also understand the way that
diversity works differently
across different groups.

The Clayman Institute for Gender Research
opened its new Women's Leadership Center last
Wednesday. The new center, led by Shelley Cor
rell, Stanford professor in sociology and director
of the Clayman Institute, aims to empower the un
derrepresented voices of women in the workplace
and promote women's leadership in business, gov
ernment and education.
The Daily sat down with Correll to discuss the
ongoing and future projects of the new leadership
center as well as her personal aspirations and
goals with the center's launch.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): [Could you] provide a
more concrete idea of what the center is meant to
do, whether that involves connecting women to op
portunities or advocating for female representa
tion in the workplace?
Shelley Correll (SC): The number-one goal is to
increase representation of women in leadership.
Our way of achieving that [is] working on three
core things. One is empowering women. We run
quite a few leadership programs in order to do so
aiready. The second thing we're doing is recruiting
men. What you see in the corporate world more
and more is that men want to play a role in empow
ering women. And the third thing that we're doing
is figuring out what workspaces or universities can
do to increase the involvement of women and men
in these issues.
TSD: The Corporate Partnership Program is
going to involve recruiting various companies to
partner with the center. How is a collaboration
with these corporations going to make a differ
ence?
SC: One of the really important goals of the center
is to bridge the gap between academic scholarship
and actual workplace practices. We have very
good scholarship on women's leadership on diver
sity and exclusion actually a lot of which was
developed at Stanford and we have a lot of cor
porations with that goal in mind but [these two
sides] haven't really been talking much. So the
idea is: Let's brings these two groups together
the academics and the workplaces and really
try to bridge the gap between them.
TSD: How large a role will the University play
with the center's projects?
SC: The Stanford community is certainly a part of
the academic side of bridging that gap. We have
several faculty members on the advisory board for
the center, and we have post-doctoral fellows
working at the center as well, and so there's a lot
of the Stanford representation. The other thing I'll
say is that we've been doing a lot of work on how


Courtesy of Shelley Correll
we can improve women's
leadership on campus as
well. A lot of the things that
we're learning are how to
make diversity and exclusion
work better, which can also
be lessons that we can bring
to the Stanford community
as well. Stanford does a won
derful job getting a diverse
undergraduate student pop
ulation, but [we] can do more
when it comes to faculty.

TSD: With the official launch
[having happened on
Wednesday], what are the
next steps that the center
will be taking to forward
your goals?
SC: We have [several] re
search projects where we're
trying to better understand
what works in terms of ad
vancing women leaders and
creating active organiza
tions. We're also expanding
the kinds of training that we
have available and the audi
ence to which those [pro
grams] are directed. We're
really just trying to expand
[our] curriculum to reach as
many people as possible and
evaluating if people are
learning and applying it.

TSD: Do you have any per
sonal goals for the center,
and if so, what are they?
SC: Yeah I do actually. I have
been a professor here since
2001, for 13 years. My re
search over that time has fo
cused a lot on the barriers of
women's advancement. I've
learned a lot about what puts
them down. When I became a
professor, women occupied
about 14 percent of leader
ship positions, and now it's

about 15 [or] 17 percent.
With that rate of change,
we're not getting there any
time soon. I'm no longer pa
tient enough to deal with that
slow rate of change. For me
personally, it's about moving
on that knowledge, collabo
rating with other scholars
and incorporating folks to
work on these issues.
It's an academic goal for
me but it's also something
that I'm looking forward to in
my career this is where I
want to make a mark.

TSD: Is the Center address
ing the queer population at
all?
SC: We actually are. Even
though it's a center directed
towards women leadership,
what you find when you start
uncovering obstacles is that
we start finding all kinds of
obstacles for all kinds of
groups and all different
kinds of women. The issues
that affect a heterosexual
woman with three kids are
not going to be the same is
sues that a young lesbian will
face as she starts her first
job. So we need to under
stand both [how] the things
