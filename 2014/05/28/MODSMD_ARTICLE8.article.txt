## Q&A 
### Niall Ferguson 
This interview is part of The
Daily's "Ideas of an Interna
tional Order" series, running
April 27-30, 2011, which ex
plores the potential for evolving
and contrasting concepts of an
international system in the
21st century and what Am,erica
can or should do in response.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Where
is the international order going?
Niall Ferguson (NF): When people
talk about the international order,
they're usually conflating two or
three different things. Number one,
the order that was devised at the end
of WWII that we associate with the
United Nations. Two, a set of eco
nomic arrangements around about
the same time Bretton Woods
and the associated financial institu
tions like the International Mone
tary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.
And then three, the institutions and
alliances that evolved over the
course of the Cold War somewhat
later. And so it's hard to use a term
like "the international order" for
something which is multidimension
al and evolving.

The first thing, I think, to notice,
is that a massive economic shift in
the balance of power is happening
and has been happening not only
throughout your life but [in fact
throughout] my life. And that has
rendered some of the international
architecture of the post-1945 period
obviously anachronistic. I think
that's the biggest challenge to the in
ternational system. It's not that
China wants to challenge the United
States in some kind of Thucydides
type contest. It's more that because
of its growth because of its grow
ing dependence on imported energy
China has to be a more powerful
state in terms of military and naval
capability. That's not some kind of vi
olation of the international order;
that is a real consequence of China's
growth.

The second point I'd make is that
the financial order that we live in is
unrecognizably different from what
John Maynard Keynes and Harry
Dexter White had in mind at Bret
ton Woods. Bretton Woods fell apart
in the early 19705. The international
financial system exploded in size as
capital flows were deregulated, and
we now live in a completely different
financial world order, [one] which
very nearly blew up just six years
ago and is in the process of being re
assembled. But that process isn't
over because the regulatory innova
tions in Europe and the U.S. still are
a work in progress.
And finally, I think that the mili
tary alliance system the U.S. built
up in the Cold War is falling apart
because the United States no longer
looks like a credible hegemon, at
least under this President. And
that's the other development of re
cent years. The U.S. has lost its
credibility as an alliance leader,
whether you look at Europe or the
Middle East or East Asia.
TSD: What exactly does the recent
Ukraine crisis and some of the other
Russian interventions preceding it
represent: a return to normalcy, or
some completely different type of
action?
NF: It was very unfortunate that
President Obama said in January
that he didn't need a George Ken
nan, because almost immediately it
became clear that he did. He and his
advisors did not read Putin right and
they got themselves into a very
weak position. I think most striking
ly, an international agreement to up
hold the sovereignty of the Ukraine
from the 1990s was violated with no
military downside, only financial.
The annexation of Crimea has been
achieved by Russia at tolerable cost.
So what one has to recognize is
that this is a pretty bad precedent,
