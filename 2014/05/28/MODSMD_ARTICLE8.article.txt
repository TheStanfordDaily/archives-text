## Q&A 
### Niall Ferguson 
This interview is part of The
Daily's "Ideas of an Interna
tional Order" series, running
April 27-30, 2011, which ex
plores the potential for evolving
and contrasting concepts of an
international system in the
21st century and what Am,erica
can or should do in response.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Where
is the international order going?
Niall Ferguson (NF): When people
talk about the international order,
they're usually conflating two or
three different things. Number one,
the order that was devised at the end
of WWII that we associate with the
United Nations. Two, a set of eco
nomic arrangements around about
the same time Bretton Woods
and the associated financial institu
tions like the International Mone
tary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.
And then three, the institutions and
alliances that evolved over the
course of the Cold War somewhat
later. And so it's hard to use a term
like "the international order" for
something which is multidimension
al and evolving.

The first thing, I think, to notice,
is that a massive economic shift in
the balance of power is happening
and has been happening not only
throughout your life but [in fact
throughout] my life. And that has
rendered some of the international
architecture of the post-1945 period
obviously anachronistic. I think
that's the biggest challenge to the in
ternational system. It's not that
China wants to challenge the United
States in some kind of Thucydides
type contest. It's more that because
of its growth because of its grow
ing dependence on imported energy
China has to be a more powerful
state in terms of military and naval
capability. That's not some kind of vi
olation of the international order;
that is a real consequence of China's
growth.

The second point I'd make is that
the financial order that we live in is
unrecognizably different from what
John Maynard Keynes and Harry
Dexter White had in mind at Bret
ton Woods. Bretton Woods fell apart
in the early 19705. The international
financial system exploded in size as
capital flows were deregulated, and
we now live in a completely different
financial world order, [one] which
very nearly blew up just six years
ago and is in the process of being re
assembled. But that process isn't
over because the regulatory innova
tions in Europe and the U.S. still are
a work in progress.
And finally, I think that the mili
tary alliance system the U.S. built
up in the Cold War is falling apart
because the United States no longer
looks like a credible hegemon, at
least under this President. And
that's the other development of re
cent years. The U.S. has lost its
credibility as an alliance leader,
whether you look at Europe or the
Middle East or East Asia.
TSD: What exactly does the recent
Ukraine crisis and some of the other
Russian interventions preceding it
represent: a return to normalcy, or
some completely different type of
action?
NF: It was very unfortunate that
President Obama said in January
that he didn't need a George Ken
nan, because almost immediately it
became clear that he did. He and his
advisors did not read Putin right and
they got themselves into a very
weak position. I think most striking
ly, an international agreement to up
hold the sovereignty of the Ukraine
from the 1990s was violated with no
military downside, only financial.
The annexation of Crimea has been
achieved by Russia at tolerable cost.
So what one has to recognize is
that this is a pretty bad precedent,
but I think it's part of an on
going process of American
strategic failure that goes
back to Syria and maybe back
to the Arab Spring's out
break. Although Crimea
doesn't look like it's of enor
mous importance to the Unit
ed States as we sit here in
Stanford, it's important be
cause it signals that, as in
Syria, you can use military
force in defiance of the Unit
ed States and get away with
it. And that's the thing that's
concerning to me this is a
clear encouragement to other
regimes to try the same ap
proach.
TSD: Is that the fault of the
President or the political con
cerns surrounding the Presi
dent?
NF: The public mood is
strongly against internation
al intervention. If one looks at
polls, we haven't seen this
lack of interest in the rest of
the world since before World
War 11. It's not quite Isola
tionism 2.0, but it's kind of
getting that way. And I think
that the President, to some
degree, has reflected that
public mood.
I think he's not in that
sense an isolated figure on
the contrary, I think there's a
substantial part of the politi
cal establishment, of both the
left and the right, that is in
clined to reduce America's
commitment overseas. It's
only really John McCain who
appears on primetime televi
sion arguing for intervention
in Syria or Ukraine.
So I don't think the Presi
dent's on his own here. I think
he's channeling both the pub
lic mood and an elite mood,
which isn't uniquely Demo
cratic I think Republicans
are probably just as inclined
to disengage from global
problems.

TSD: So what do you think
the United States should be
doing in terms of grand strat
egy and also in terms of poli
cy-defining what it's planning
to do in order to ensure some
kind of stability and to secure
the future of its institutions?
NF: Well, first of all, I think
having a grand strategy
would be a good idea, rather
than just improvising in re
sponse to fiscal and domestic
political pressures. I would
like to see a much higher cal
iber of person helping the
President to formulate that
strategy with a mandate re
ally to think about what the
rise of China means for U.S.
foreign policy and indeed for
the U.S. alliance system,
which in Asia looks increas
ingly anachronistic.
I think the U.S. needs,

when it assesses its predica
ment, to recognize that, al
though in relative terms it
may not be as powerful as it
was in 1945 or 1950, in other
respects it's more powerful,
because there is no antago
nist as hostile and dangerous
as the Soviet Union was then.
In many ways, America's en
emies and rivals are weak.
Russia is not a superpower.
And China is so preoccupied
with its internal problems
that, as I said, its challenge is

not really one that is very
conscious or aggressive.
So I think there are op
tions open to the U.S., which
still enjoys tremendous lead
ership in energy and infor
mation technology. It just re
quires some thought about
priorities, and some recogni
tion that the institutions we
began by talking about are
looking somewhat dated and
certainly aren't appropriate
to a world in which, by at least
one measure, China is now
the largest economy, or a
world in which Russia is a
much reduced threat to the
independence of Western
Europe.
What I would argue is for
some more serious reflection
on grand strategy, and that's
something the President has
been disinclined to do. So
maybe he does need George
Kennan or somebody like
George Kennan to help him
think about these problems.
They're not easy, and one of
the mistakes that people
sometimes make at elite uni
versities is to think that inter
national relations is easier
than, say, economics or com
puter science. Actually, it's
way more difficult, because
it's not actually possible to
model the processes that
we're talking about, and you
have to have some real histor
ical understanding to make
sense of the challenges that
the U.S. currently faces in
Europe, the Middle East or
the Far East. These are his
torically informed decisions
that have to be taken and
they need historically in
formed people to take them.

egy and also in terms of poli
cy-defining what it's planning
to do in order to ensure some
kind of stability and to secure
the future of its institutions?
NF: Well, first of all, I think
having a grand strategy
would be a good idea, rather
than just improvising in re
sponse to fiscal and domestic
political pressures. I would
like to see a much higher cal
iber of person helping the
President to formulate that
strategy with a mandate re
ally to think about what the
rise of China means for U.S.
foreign policy and indeed for
the U.S. alliance system,
which in Asia looks increas
ingly anachronistic.
I think the U.S. needs,

when it assesses its predica
ment, to recognize that, al
though in relative terms it
may not be as powerful as it
was in 1945 or 1950, in other
respects it's more powerful,
because there is no antago
nist as hostile and dangerous
as the Soviet Union was then.
In many ways, America's en
emies and rivals are weak.
Russia is not a superpower.
And China is so preoccupied
with its internal problems
that, as I said, its challenge is

not really one that is very
conscious or aggressive.
So I think there are op
tions open to the U.S., which
still enjoys tremendous lead
ership in energy and infor
mation technology. It just re
quires some thought about
priorities, and some recogni
tion that the institutions we
began by talking about are
looking somewhat dated and
certainly aren't appropriate
to a world in which, by at least
one measure, China is now
the largest economy, or a
world in which Russia is a
much reduced threat to the
independence of Western
Europe.
What I would argue is for
some more serious reflection
on grand strategy, and that's
something the President has
been disinclined to do. So
maybe he does need George
Kennan or somebody like
George Kennan to help him
think about these problems.
They're not easy, and one of
the mistakes that people
sometimes make at elite uni
versities is to think that inter
national relations is easier
than, say, economics or com
puter science. Actually, it's
way more difficult, because
it's not actually possible to
model the processes that
we're talking about, and you
have to have some real histor
ical understanding to make
sense of the challenges that
the U.S. currently faces in
Europe, the Middle East or
the Far East. These are his
torically informed decisions
that have to be taken and
they need historically in
formed people to take them.

This interview is part of The
Daily's "Ideas of an Interna
tional Order" series, running
April 27-30, 2011, which ex
plores the potential for evolving
and contrasting concepts of an
international system in the
21st century and what Am,erica
can or should do in response.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Where
is the international order going?
Niall Ferguson (NF): When people
talk about the international order,
they're usually conflating two or
three different things. Number one,
the order that was devised at the end
of WWII that we associate with the
United Nations. Two, a set of eco
nomic arrangements around about
the same time Bretton Woods
and the associated financial institu
tions like the International Mone
tary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.
And then three, the institutions and
alliances that evolved over the
course of the Cold War somewhat
later. And so it's hard to use a term
like "the international order" for
something which is multidimension
al and evolving.

The first thing, I think, to notice,
is that a massive economic shift in
the balance of power is happening
and has been happening not only
throughout your life but [in fact
throughout] my life. And that has
rendered some of the international
architecture of the post-1945 period
obviously anachronistic. I think
that's the biggest challenge to the in
ternational system. It's not that
China wants to challenge the United
States in some kind of Thucydides
type contest. It's more that because
of its growth because of its grow
ing dependence on imported energy
China has to be a more powerful
state in terms of military and naval
capability. That's not some kind of vi
olation of the international order;
that is a real consequence of China's
growth.

The second point I'd make is that
the financial order that we live in is
unrecognizably different from what
John Maynard Keynes and Harry
Dexter White had in mind at Bret
ton Woods. Bretton Woods fell apart
in the early 19705. The international
financial system exploded in size as
capital flows were deregulated, and
we now live in a completely different
financial world order, [one] which
very nearly blew up just six years
ago and is in the process of being re
assembled. But that process isn't
over because the regulatory innova
tions in Europe and the U.S. still are
a work in progress.
And finally, I think that the mili
tary alliance system the U.S. built
up in the Cold War is falling apart
because the United States no longer
looks like a credible hegemon, at
least under this President. And
that's the other development of re
cent years. The U.S. has lost its
credibility as an alliance leader,
whether you look at Europe or the
Middle East or East Asia.
TSD: What exactly does the recent
Ukraine crisis and some of the other
Russian interventions preceding it
represent: a return to normalcy, or
some completely different type of
action?
NF: It was very unfortunate that
President Obama said in January
that he didn't need a George Ken
nan, because almost immediately it
became clear that he did. He and his
advisors did not read Putin right and
they got themselves into a very
weak position. I think most striking
ly, an international agreement to up
hold the sovereignty of the Ukraine
from the 1990s was violated with no
military downside, only financial.
The annexation of Crimea has been
achieved by Russia at tolerable cost.
So what one has to recognize is
that this is a pretty bad precedent,
but I think it's part of an on
going process of American
strategic failure that goes
back to Syria and maybe back
to the Arab Spring's out
break. Although Crimea
doesn't look like it's of enor
mous importance to the Unit
ed States as we sit here in
Stanford, it's important be
cause it signals that, as in
Syria, you can use military
force in defiance of the Unit
ed States and get away with
it. And that's the thing that's
concerning to me this is a
clear encouragement to other
regimes to try the same ap
proach.
TSD: Is that the fault of the
President or the political con
cerns surrounding the Presi
dent?
NF: The public mood is
strongly against internation
al intervention. If one looks at
polls, we haven't seen this
lack of interest in the rest of
the world since before World
War 11. It's not quite Isola
tionism 2.0, but it's kind of
getting that way. And I think
that the President, to some
degree, has reflected that
public mood.
I think he's not in that
sense an isolated figure on
the contrary, I think there's a
substantial part of the politi
cal establishment, of both the
left and the right, that is in
clined to reduce America's
commitment overseas. It's
only really John McCain who
appears on primetime televi
sion arguing for intervention
in Syria or Ukraine.
So I don't think the Presi
dent's on his own here. I think
he's channeling both the pub
lic mood and an elite mood,
which isn't uniquely Demo
cratic I think Republicans
are probably just as inclined
to disengage from global
problems.

TSD: So what do you think
the United States should be
doing in terms of grand strat
egy and also in terms of poli
cy-defining what it's planning
to do in order to ensure some
kind of stability and to secure
the future of its institutions?

would be a good idea, rather

over because the regulatory innova
tions in Europe and the U.S. still are
a work in progress.
And finally, I think that the mili
tary alliance system the U.S. built
up in the Cold War is falling apart
because the United States no longer
looks like a credible hegemon, at
least under this President. And
that's the other development of re
cent years. The U.S. has lost its
credibility as an alliance leader,
whether you look at Europe or the
Middle East or East Asia.
TSD: What exactly does the recent
Ukraine crisis and some of the other
Russian interventions preceding it
represent: a return to normalcy, or
some completely different type of
action?
NF: It was very unfortunate that
President Obama said in January
that he didn't need a George Ken
nan, because almost immediately it
became clear that he did. He and his
advisors did not read Putin right and
they got themselves into a very
weak position. I think most striking
ly, an international agreement to up
hold the sovereignty of the Ukraine
from the 1990s was violated with no
military downside, only financial.
The annexation of Crimea has been
achieved by Russia at tolerable cost.
So what one has to recognize is
that this is a pretty bad precedent,
but I think it's part of an on
going process of American
strategic failure that goes
back to Syria and maybe back
to the Arab Spring's out
break. Although Crimea
doesn't look like it's of enor
mous importance to the Unit
ed States as we sit here in
Stanford, it's important be
cause it signals that, as in
Syria, you can use military
force in defiance of the Unit
ed States and get away with
it. And that's the thing that's
concerning to me this is a
clear encouragement to other
regimes to try the same ap
proach.
TSD: Is that the fault of the
President or the political con
cerns surrounding the Presi
dent?
NF: The public mood is
strongly against internation
al intervention. If one looks at
polls, we haven't seen this
lack of interest in the rest of
the world since before World
War 11. It's not quite Isola
tionism 2.0, but it's kind of
getting that way. And I think
that the President, to some
degree, has reflected that
public mood.
I think he's not in that
sense an isolated figure on
the contrary, I think there's a
substantial part of the politi
cal establishment, of both the
left and the right, that is in
clined to reduce America's
commitment overseas. It's
only really John McCain who
appears on primetime televi
sion arguing for intervention
in Syria or Ukraine.
So I don't think the Presi
dent's on his own here. I think
he's channeling both the pub
lic mood and an elite mood,
which isn't uniquely Demo
cratic I think Republicans
are probably just as inclined
to disengage from global
problems.

TSD: So what do you think
the United States should be
doing in terms of grand strat
egy and also in terms of poli
cy-defining what it's planning
to do in order to ensure some
kind of stability and to secure
the future of its institutions?
NF: Well, first of all, I think
having a grand strategy
would be a good idea, rather
than just improvising in re
sponse to fiscal and domestic
political pressures. I would
like to see a much higher cal
iber of person helping the
President to formulate that
strategy with a mandate re
ally to think about what the
rise of China means for U.S.
foreign policy and indeed for
the U.S. alliance system,
which in Asia looks increas
ingly anachronistic.
I think the U.S. needs,

when it assesses its predica
ment, to recognize that, al
though in relative terms it
may not be as powerful as it
was in 1945 or 1950, in other
respects it's more powerful,
because there is no antago
nist as hostile and dangerous
as the Soviet Union was then.
In many ways, America's en
emies and rivals are weak.
Russia is not a superpower.
And China is so preoccupied
with its internal problems
that, as I said, its challenge is

not really one that is very
conscious or aggressive.
So I think there are op
tions open to the U.S., which
still enjoys tremendous lead
ership in energy and infor
mation technology. It just re
quires some thought about
priorities, and some recogni
tion that the institutions we
began by talking about are
looking somewhat dated and
certainly aren't appropriate
to a world in which, by at least
one measure, China is now
the largest economy, or a
world in which Russia is a
much reduced threat to the
independence of Western
Europe.
What I would argue is for
some more serious reflection
on grand strategy, and that's
something the President has
been disinclined to do. So
maybe he does need George
Kennan or somebody like
George Kennan to help him
think about these problems.
They're not easy, and one of
the mistakes that people
sometimes make at elite uni
versities is to think that inter
national relations is easier
than, say, economics or com
puter science. Actually, it's
way more difficult, because
it's not actually possible to
model the processes that
we're talking about, and you
have to have some real histor
ical understanding to make
sense of the challenges that
the U.S. currently faces in
Europe, the Middle East or
the Far East. These are his
torically informed decisions
that have to be taken and
they need historically in
formed people to take them.
