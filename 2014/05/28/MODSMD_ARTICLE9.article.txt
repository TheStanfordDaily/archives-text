# SEEING GREEN
## "No Child Left Inside" 
### Holly Moeller 
What was playtime like when
you were growing up? Was
it outside defending forts
and exploring streambeds with your
friends? Did your parents think it
was too dangerous for you to roam
around by yourself? Did you prefer
playing on the basketball court or
playing video games?

What were vacations like? Did
you take them? Where did you go?
Big cities, national parks or some
where in between? Did you spend
your nights in ail' conditioned resorts
or zipped up in a tent under the stars?
Whatever your childhood experi
ences may have been, chances are
they shaped your relationship to the
natural world today and their im
pact will linger long into your adult
life. And, as we're now learning
through an array of studies of the
current generation a crew of folk
who seem to spend far less time out
doors than any previous generation
having outdoor experiences can
have big impacts on other areas of
your life, too.

One of the most obvious impacts
of outdoor playtime is a marked im
provement in physical fitness. That's
not to say that you can't get a work
out indoors and certainly the
multi-tasking studiers perched on
the treadmills and bikes at Stan
ford's gyms prove that you can get
your cardio and your A+'s simulta
neously.

But when it comes to inspiring a
fit lifestyle, there's nothing quite as
successful as turning kids outdoors
to play starting at a young age. In
fact, many believe that childhood
obesity which turns into adult
obesity and, ultimately, produces the
obesity epidemic currently con
fronting our country can be cur
tailed by introducing a more rigor
ous outdoor gym program in elemen
tary schools.
Beyond physical fitness, outdoor
playtime can also have big effects on
the developing brain. Teachers who
incorporated the outdoors into their
teaching found that their students
performed better in math and sci
ence than those who stuck to the
original curriculum. And some chil
dren seem to return from outdoor
outings with longer attention spans
than when they left.
Plenty of research also suggests
that outdoor time can improve our
moods, enhance our social interac
tions and generally make us nicer
people. So the benefits of getting out
side are at least three-pronged:
physical, mental and emotional.
But in a world where kids spend
less than 10 minutes per day en
gaged in outdoor activities (com
pared to a whopping 7.5 hours in
front of digital screens like TVs,
iPhones and computers), how can we
ensure that our children reap these

triple benefits?
Some, like me, will grow up in
homes with parents who value the
outdoors, either for its own sake or
because they understand the impor
tance of nature exposure to child de
velopment. Others will extend this
experience or begin it when
they leave home, perhaps on a camp
ing trip with college friends or a first
visit to a National Park.
But what about the other kids,
the ones who don't have this access
through their families or who live in
areas remote from "wilderness" or
walled in by urban sprawl? And how
much "nature" do they need? Will a
local city green space combined
with the occasional school field trip to
a more remote location serve that
purpose? Or does everyone need a
multi-day, life-altering backpacking
trip in the high Sierras?
It's for these kids that Congress
man Ron Kind (D-WI) and Senator
Mark Udall (D-CO) introduced the
"Healthy Kids Outdoors Act," which
would provide funding to programs
that try to connect children to the
outdoors. It's not the first time legis
lation of this kind has been intro
duced a previous iteration of the
Healthy Kids Act died in a previous
congressional session, and a similar
bill, the "No Child Left Inside Act,"
was referred to committee almost a
year ago. According to govtrackus, a
legislative transparency site, the
NCLIA has a zero percent chance of
being enacted.
The hearts of these legislators
are in the right place, even if change
is a long way off. Certainly, they have
the support of many environmental
advocacy groups, who recognize the
importance of connecting kids with
nature to ensure that the conserva
tion ethic stays alive and well in
America. But they also need the sup
port of you and me, both intellectual
ly and through our actions.
It's our job to make sure that our
kids when and if we have them
get outside. By the time we're chas
ing toddlers around, the research
will be even clearer, but the societal
shift into the digital vacuum will have
progressed even further. So in the
meantime, try to get outside yourself
to cement that link between nature,
brainpower and happiness.
At the very least, all this Califor
nia sunshine ensures that you will
have plenty of Vitamin D.
