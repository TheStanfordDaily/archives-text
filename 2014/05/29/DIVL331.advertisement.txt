The service will be held Monday, June 2, at

Alto, 1140 Cowper Street (at the corner with

Judy was a kind and gentle woman; an activist
for peace and equal rights for all; a lover of clas
sical music, art, French language and literature;
a devoted wife and mother; a citizen of the
world. She is deeply missed by her husband,
Dave, her sons Chris and Peter, her caregivers
Cathy and Robin, and all who knew her.
