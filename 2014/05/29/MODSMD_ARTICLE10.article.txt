# SUPER TUESDAY
## More tea, anyone? 
### Josh Jones 
News anchors and political
cartoonists have made
absolute hay of the results of
the Republican primary elections in
various states throughout the
nation. As GOP "establishment"
candidates such as Mitch McConnell
and John Cornyn coasted to victory,
many smugly concluded that the
Tea Party had officially run dry,
with nothing but the dregs of a
would-be movement for consola
tion.
But people like Senate Majority
Leader Harry Reid were declaring
the Tea Party "dead" in 2012, and
though they may be re-energized by
the results at the polls, they are just
as wrong now as they were then.
For one, it is the general consen
sus that the GOP as a whole has
been forced to the right by the Tea
Party. Gone, reports The Wall
Street Journal, are the days when
"compromise with Democrats wasn't
viewed with such deep suspicion."
No, a quick return to unabashed
Bush-era government spending and
growth would not go unnoticed, and
it would be foolish for the Republi
can Party to forget that it was only
by voting down debt ceilings that
they were able to satiate the Tea
Party's thirst for principled conser
vatismâ€” a thirst that, I contend,
reflects the views of the Republican
base.
In reality, this shift could be con
sidered the Tea Party's greatest
victory of all. While it's all good and
fun to be the ideological purists on
the fringe, the goal of any national

movement is to garner popular
support and enact lasting change.
What many forget is that the Tea
Party is a revival of conservative
ideology, not an actual party. The es
tablishment can only gloat so much
when they are being stiff-armed
into adopting their opponents' posi
tions.
But the Republican Civil War is
far from over. Tea Party favorite
Ben Sasse easily won the nomina
tion to represent Nebraska in the
U.S. Senate, as did House candidate
Alex Mooney of West Virginia. In
Mississippi last week, a poll showed
Tea Party favorite Chris McDaniel
(who had been trailing his opponent
just weeks before) leading 36-year
incumbent Thad Cochran.
Last night in Texas, the core of
any Republican Electoral College
majority, the Tea Party had
something of a sweep, defeating
establishment candidates in House,
lieutenant governor and attorney
general races.
Even the American public seems
at least open to the possibility of
more tea. Senator Rand Paul, the
Tea Party darling who consistently
wins or ties for first in polls predict
ing the Republican presidential
nomination in 2016, has already
shown he can give Hillary Clinton a
run for her money. Paul beats the
ex-Secretary of State in hypothetical
setups in battleground states such
as Colorado and New Hampshire.
And while it is no surprie that Paul
wins in his own home state of
Kentucky, it is interesting to note

that he garners a surprising 29 per
cent of the African American vote.
Granted, Hillary currently
trounces Paul 50-41 in nationwide
polls, but this is hardly compelling
evidence of a declining Tea Party.
Even Ted Cruz, who takes a softer
stance on some of the more libertar
ian positions of his Kentucky
counterpart, scrapes together 38
percent of the vote to Hillary's 52
percent. Fringe movements can
only be considered so fringe when
they have the potential to garner
nearly half of the nation's support.
The next few weeks and months
will tell whether the movement is
truly losing steam, as Tea Party
heroes such as Justin Amash and
Kerry Bentivolio face the wrath of a
well-funded, organized Republican
establishment. But for now, the op
tions before the GOP are clear:
Drink the tea or make way for
someone who will. Simply ignoring
the elephant in the room is just as
dangerous an option now for
moderates as it ever has been.

Josh Jones, incidentally, does not
drink tea. But if you think he's
drinking the Kool-Aid, shoot him an
