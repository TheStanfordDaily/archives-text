## Politics aside, please 
### Nick Ahamed 
Like all tragedies associated
with war, the recent evidence
suggesting mismanagement
at Veterans Affairs hospitals has led
to veterans' deaths is appalling.
However, what it is not is political.
Or, at least it shouldn't be.
Republicans have certainly
capitalized on the opportunity to
attack the Obama Administration
and "big government," citing the
former's support for the latter as the
reason for the scandal.
The chairman of the House Vet
erans Affairs Committee, Jeff Miller
(R-FL) told CNN: "You've got an en
trenched bureaucracy that exists out
there that is not held accountable."
In other words, Miller says, the VA's
failures are big government run
amok.
Even more scathing and direct
are the remarks from Jim Nicholson,
who was the Secretary of Veterans
Affairs under President George W
Bush a man himself not free of
scandal. First, he questioned Presi
dent Obama's commitment to veter
ans because "he never showed up" to
Veterans Affairs Committee
meetings while he was a senator.
More to the point, Nicholson stated,
"What's happening now is the Presi
dent of the United States is not
taking responsibility for this, and
what I think the root problem is with
these hospital directors is we've seen
this kind of dishonesty and duplicity
on the part of the President." This
was no minor politician looking to
score points on C-SPAN: Nicholson
was chairman of the Republican
National Committee from 1997 to
2001.
Many Republicans criticize Pres
ident Obama for not holding people
accountable and, it seems, would
have acted differently.
Or not. Let's compare President
Obama's stance to that of these Re

publicans:
OBAMA: "I have said to Ric
[Eric Shinseki, the Secretary of
Veterans Affairs], and I said it to him
today, I want to see what the results
of these [VA Inspector General]
reports are, and there is going to be
accountability." (5/21/2014)
NICHOLSON: "I think it's pre
mature to make that decision [to lire
Shinseki], There's a lot of investigat
ing that needs to go on." (5/23/2014)
MILLER: "Secretary Shinseki
doesn't need to go until we've seen
the final [VA Inspector General]
report." (5/25/2014)
There seems to be a consensus
that the solution is not simply to fire
General Shinseki, but to investigate
further. That is precisely what
President Obama is doing.
Even Republican House Majori
ty Leader John Boehner agrees with
President Obama, stating: "I have
not called for Gen. Shinseki to
resign." Indeed, he cites the problem
not with Obama, but with adminis
trators below Shinseki: "This isn't
about one person. This isn't about
the Secretary. It is about the entire
system underneath him."
Indeed, we have consistently
failed veterans, regardless of the
president's party. In 2003, hundreds
of thousands of veterans were
waiting more than 180 days to
receive medical care. In 1991, eight
patients died from poor treatment in
a Chicago VA hospital; similarly,
inadequate care spurred a 19-day
hunger strike in 1974. And perhaps
most famously, the Bonus Army a
grouped of retired WWI vets, occu
pied a Depression-era Hooverville in
1932 in protest of delayed benefits.
The biggest predictor of a VA
failure isn't big government or
Democrats; it's war. We must re
member that there is no need for a
Department of Veterans' Affairs with-

out an active Department of Defense.
According to the Washington
Post, almost one out of every two
veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan file
for disability. There were more
claims last year than any previous
year, with 611,000. Even now, there is
a backlog 0f300,000 cases which have
been dealt with for more than 125 days.
"The other area that we have to
talk about is that 2 million new veter
ans coming in in the last few years,"
said Bernie Sanders, chairman of the
Senate Veterans Affairs Committee.
"Do we have the staff in all areas of
this country to accommodate the
needs of those veterans? Frankly,
between you and me, I'm not sure
that we do."
So yes, we must solve the current
VA backlog and punish those admin
istrators who were duplicitous. But
we must also recognize the greater
problem: a growing civil-military
divide that allows these failures to
happen.
Hundreds of thousands of Amer
icans go abroad to defend this nation
and their service is rarely on the top
of our minds, even when they return.
Kimberly Tan powerfully explains
that civilians have very little idea of
the reality of war. Perhaps if they did,
we wouldn't have spent so long in
Iraq. Perhaps if they did, there
would have been fewer wounds to
heal.
Last Wednesday, Matthew Col
ford and Tim Hsia asked you to re
flect on our soldiers' service. I echo
their challenge to bike past Memori
al Auditorium and remember what
others have given for us to be here.
But I also would like to push you to
think about when that service should
be invoked.

"Do we have the staff in all areas of
this country to accommodate the
needs of those veterans? Frankly,
between you and me, I'm not sure
that we do."
So yes, we must solve the current
VA backlog and punish those admin
istrators who were duplicitous. But
we must also recognize the greater
problem: a growing civil-military
divide that allows these failures to
happen.
Hundreds of thousands of Amer
icans go abroad to defend this nation
and their service is rarely on the top
of our minds, even when they return.
Kimberly Tan powerfully explains
that civilians have very little idea of
the reality of war. Perhaps if they did,
we wouldn't have spent so long in
Iraq. Perhaps if they did, there
would have been fewer wounds to
heal.
Last Wednesday, Matthew Col
ford and Tim Hsia asked you to re
flect on our soldiers' service. I echo
their challenge to bike past Memori
al Auditorium and remember what
others have given for us to be here.
But I also would like to push you to
think about when that service should
be invoked.

Like all tragedies associated
with war, the recent evidence
suggesting mismanagement
at Veterans Affairs hospitals has led
to veterans' deaths is appalling.
However, what it is not is political.
Or, at least it shouldn't be.
Republicans have certainly
capitalized on the opportunity to
attack the Obama Administration
and "big government," citing the
former's support for the latter as the
reason for the scandal.
The chairman of the House Vet
erans Affairs Committee, Jeff Miller
(R-FL) told CNN: "You've got an en
trenched bureaucracy that exists out
there that is not held accountable."
In other words, Miller says, the VA's
failures are big government run
amok.
Even more scathing and direct
are the remarks from Jim Nicholson,
who was the Secretary of Veterans
Affairs under President George W
Bush a man himself not free of
scandal. First, he questioned Presi
dent Obama's commitment to veter
ans because "he never showed up" to
Veterans Affairs Committee
meetings while he was a senator.
More to the point, Nicholson stated,
"What's happening now is the Presi
dent of the United States is not
taking responsibility for this, and
what I think the root problem is with
these hospital directors is we've seen
this kind of dishonesty and duplicity
on the part of the President." This
was no minor politician looking to
score points on C-SPAN: Nicholson
was chairman of the Republican
National Committee from 1997 to
2001.
Many Republicans criticize Pres
ident Obama for not holding people
accountable and, it seems, would
have acted differently.
Or not. Let's compare President
Obama's stance to that of these Re

publicans:
OBAMA: "I have said to Ric
[Eric Shinseki, the Secretary of
Veterans Affairs], and I said it to him
today, I want to see what the results
of these [VA Inspector General]
reports are, and there is going to be
accountability." (5/21/2014)
NICHOLSON: "I think it's pre
mature to make that decision [to lire
Shinseki], There's a lot of investigat
ing that needs to go on." (5/23/2014)
MILLER: "Secretary Shinseki
doesn't need to go until we've seen
the final [VA Inspector General]
report." (5/25/2014)
There seems to be a consensus
that the solution is not simply to fire
General Shinseki, but to investigate
further. That is precisely what
President Obama is doing.
Even Republican House Majori
ty Leader John Boehner agrees with
President Obama, stating: "I have
not called for Gen. Shinseki to
resign." Indeed, he cites the problem
not with Obama, but with adminis
trators below Shinseki: "This isn't
about one person. This isn't about
the Secretary. It is about the entire
system underneath him."
Indeed, we have consistently
failed veterans, regardless of the
president's party. In 2003, hundreds
of thousands of veterans were
waiting more than 180 days to
receive medical care. In 1991, eight
patients died from poor treatment in
a Chicago VA hospital; similarly,
inadequate care spurred a 19-day
hunger strike in 1974. And perhaps
most famously, the Bonus Army a
grouped of retired WWI vets, occu
pied a Depression-era Hooverville in
1932 in protest of delayed benefits.
The biggest predictor of a VA
failure isn't big government or
Democrats; it's war. We must re
member that there is no need for a
Department of Veterans' Affairs with-

out an active Department of Defense.
According to the Washington
Post, almost one out of every two
veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan file
for disability. There were more
claims last year than any previous
year, with 611,000. Even now, there is
a backlog 0f300,000 cases which have
been dealt with for more than 125 days.
"The other area that we have to
talk about is that 2 million new veter
ans coming in in the last few years,"
said Bernie Sanders, chairman of the
Senate Veterans Affairs Committee.
"Do we have the staff in all areas of
this country to accommodate the
needs of those veterans? Frankly,
between you and me, I'm not sure
that we do."
So yes, we must solve the current
