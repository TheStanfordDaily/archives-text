## Learning to accept a house divided 
### Ashley Westhem 
Stanford has two main ri
vals, at least when it comes
to sportsâ€”which let's be
real, is all that matters to
me. Those enemies are Cal
and USC.
I've already admitted my soft spot
for the Trojans, since my grandfather
rowed there and I've gone to home
football games since I was eight years
old when my dad bought me a stuffed
Traveler. But when I committed to
Stanford, of course, he went and
bought me a stuffed tree, which now
rides on top of Traveler as his obvious
superior.
For Cal, however, I have never had
a stitch of warm feelings. Sure, I ap
plied there, but it's just been to me our
unequal competitor across the Bay
that I have learned to dislike (which
wasn't hard since, as a Tbojan fan, I
had strong feelings against them as
well).

Given these rivalries with USC
and Cal, what other top schools could
my sister possibly have been choosing
between? None. It was either USC or
Cal neither one very favorable in
the eyes of a Cardinal.
So now, in addition to my small soft
spot for USC (wince), I now have a
slightly bigger soft spot for Cal
(cringe), as Sierra Westhem is now a
member of its Class of 2018. It's for
mally official now that I got her grad
uation announcement in the mail yes
terday with a big "Go Bears" on the
bottom. Then again, Cal may be the
rival, but USC is the enemy, so I ap
prove a little more.
Although technically we're a house
divided I'm sure my dad will wear
that silly half Cal, half Stanford hat to
Big Game next year and although I
am incredibly proud of my sister,
there's still no question of which is the
superior institution.
Nothing can rival Nerd Nation.
Kudos to Cameron Wilson for rocking
the nerd glasses after he won the
N CAA individual golf title this week. I
am always in awe of the amazing ath
letes on this campus because they
aren't just athletes. They have that
drive for perfection, that flare of cre
ativity and the work ethic that is in
nate in all Stanford students.
They set the bar sky high for them
selves, and don't accept anything less;
that's why Stanford was ahead by
226.75 points in the Directors' Cup
standings at the conclusion of all win
ter spoids, and why it will (predictably)
win it for the 20th consecutive year at
the end of all spring sports. Let it be
noted that the award has only existed
for 21 years, and even in its first year
when the Card didn't win it, they still
came in second.
But Cardinal athletes not only
dominate in the athletic arena, but also
in the world of rigorous Stanford aca
demics. For the 2006-2007 academic
year, the NCAA recorded Stanford's
athletes' federal graduation rate to be
93 percent, just two percent shy of the
rate for all students. In addition, this
year, six Stanford athletes have won
the Pac-12's Scholar-Athlete of the
Year honors, and 14 senior athletes re
ceived this year's Award of Excellence
presented by the Stanford Alumni As
sociation. Not too shabby.
I am not going to now belittle Cal,
stick out my tongue and say that it
isn't as good. I'll let the facts and my
immense pride in my school speak for
themselves.
So yes, Sierra, I will of course be
squeezing myself into your cramped
dorm room next year after Big Game
and after I call basketball games at
Haas Pavilion for KZSU, but you will
never hear me entertain an argument
with you or any other Bears about
Stanford versus Cal. I'll keep my
mouth shut. Because honestly, what's
there to argue about?

Before we know it, Ashley West
hem's "slightly bigger soft spot"
may develop into fullfandomfor the
University that must not be named
across the bay. To help Ashley before
it's too late, send her your remedy
ideas at awesthem@stanford.edu
and Tweet her @ashwest!6.

I now have a
slightly bigger
soft spot for
Cal (cringe).
