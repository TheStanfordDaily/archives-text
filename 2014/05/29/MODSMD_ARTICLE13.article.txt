### WINSTON SHI MANAGING EDITOR 
This is the second piece of a
three-part feature running this
week on Lance Anderson,
Stanford football's defensive
coordinator and ace recruiter,
now entering his eighth season
with Stanford football Part I
focused on Anderson's reshap
ing of Stanford's recruiting ap
paratus. Part II covers Ander
son's coaching and leadership
of the Cardinal defense. Tomor
row, Part 111 will cover Ander
son's life as a college coach.

Lance Anderson is a cor
nerstone of the reinvent
ed Stanford football pro
gram, a team enjoying
sustained success for the
first time since Pop Warner
roamed the sidelines. But while
Stanford football carries with it a
strong sense of newness, the na
ture of a cornerstone is that it does
not change.
In recruiting and redefining the
program, Anderson has been an
agent of change. But now that
Stanford has become more and

more successful, Anderson has
found himself charged with main
taining continuity on one of college
football's finest defenses, as well as
mentoring players across the ros
ter. While Anderson will naturally
have to adapt as the circumstances
surrounding Stanford inevitably
change, the task is now to maintain
the well-oiled machine that is the
Stanford defense and, hopeful
ly, to help push the team as a whole
to even greater glory.

Anderson may be focusing more
on his coaching role than on re
cruiting these days, but what does
that mean? Coaching isn't just call
ing plays from the press box during
games or running drills during
practice; a coach has to keep an eye
on every facet of his players' well
being. And while recruiting is a
huge part of a team's success,
coaching is a critical part of what
makes success possible.
When Anderson arrived on
Stanford's campus, it was clear that
there were a lot of things that had
to be fixed in order to repair the
program most importantly,
making sure that players were able
to play and in the right mind to play
in the first place.
Injuries were the first thing.
"We just realized that you can

have many good football players,
but if they're not able to practice
if they're not healthy it's hard to
have a good football team," Ander
son explains. "You can't get better
as a football player unless you're on
the field practicing, unless you're
on the field playing, and Shannon
[Turley, Stanford's director of
sports performance] has done a
great job with his program here of
not only developing guys physical
ly, helping them to get bigger,
faster, stronger, to become better
football players ... they've also
stayed healthy."
Better yet, that injury protec
tion extended not only to Stan
ford's oft-injured stars but the en
tire Cardinal roster, allowing Stan
ford's newer players to keep on de
veloping. From 2006 to 2012, Tur
ley helped cut the number of
games missed to injury among
Stanford's entire two-deep by a
staggering 87 percent.
Yet and Turley would agree
cutting injuries was not a cure
all to Stanford's problems. The is
sues were far more endemic and
systemic than that.
Managing the team's psycholo
gy both on and off the field was a
key component of Stanford's suc
cess. The importance of player re
locations is well known in profes

sional soccer, where high-priced
acquisitions often fail because of
culture shock, but it's perhaps less
important for most college football
teams, which play in a sport that is
still rather regional.
That doesn't hold for Stanford:
The Cardinal are the most national
team in the country, and it isn't
close. Since Anderson arrived on
campus, Stanford has drawn re
cruits from 33 different states. Its
players travel further to get to
campus than players at any other
program in the country; aside from
crunching the numbers on recruit
ing, statistician Dave Bartoo also
found that the average player on
the 2014 roster traveled over 1,400
miles in order to get to campus.
When Stanford players return
home for Christmas, the sum total
of their round-trip journeys is al
most 300,000 miles. That's farther
than the distance from the Earth
to the Moon.
With statistics like these, one
couldn't be faulted for wondering
how Stanford's program exists at
all. College football is a regional
sport for a reason; home cooking
has a statistically significant effect,
and going to a school across the
country typically cuts a recruit's

chances of making the NFL by 25
percent. Yet Stanford is one of the
nation's premier player develop
ment programs. Needless to say,
everyone is asking why.

There are a lot of factors that go
into a player's development in col
lege. Obviously traditional training,
from strength to playing technique
and education, is important. But the
mental aspect of playing football is
also important, and it's too often ig
nored: Players need to feel at home
on campus, and they need to feel at
home in the Stanford community.
Both of these things are easier
said than done. But they are never
theless necessary. The effect of
homesickness and feeling out of
place is real. While California will al
ways be the cornerstone of its roster,
if Stanford is going to be a good foot
ball team, it needs to make the entire
country its recruiting backyard.
"We have to go national just to
find the kids who are the level of stu
dent and the level of football player
that we want to recruit," Anderson
says. "Now, it is true that the further
you're away, the harder it is some
times, because you're passing up a
lot of other good schools, good pro
grams.
"I think that's just part of grow
ing up and part of going to college. I
think our kids do a pretty good job of
adjusting. And I think the reason for
that is, number one, here on campus,
they're surrounded by so many
great people who are from all over
the world. And I think that makes
the transition a little bit easier too,
because they know that they're not
the only ones in that boat. We signed
someone from the East Coast
coming from Washington, D.C., or
wherever he might be, he's not the
only one here that is coming a great
distance to go to school. There are a
lot of others in the same boat that
he's in, so I think there's a lot of oth
ers who can relate to him on the foot
ball team and at the University."
Keeping that atmosphere happy
is a key point for Anderson. Even
when talking to The Daily last year
for Rags to Roses, Anderson was
clear about the need to keep players
happy.
"They're here for a reason,
they're here to get an education, and
I think that's so powerful for those
kids. Chase Beeler [an Ail-American
offensive lineman] I think that
was a big part of why he transferred
and came to Stanford, because he
knew that he just didn't fit in at
Oklahoma," Anderson said. "He was
different than those kids. The only
thing he really had in common was
football, where here he had a lot of
stuff in common on the field, off the
field, and you want to surround
yourself with those kinds of kids. So
I think that's a bit of an important
thing, that we give them time to
spend with our players, away from
the coaches, where they can go and
hang out with them and spend some
time. That's important."
Similarly, it was also vital not
only to maintain chemistry within
the team but also within the Univer
sity. The football team has worked to
make football a greater part of the
Stanford community.
When Stanford professors are
honored during commercial breaks
in football games, fans sometimes
think that the purpose of doing so is
to underline the University's aca
demic and athletic prowess, rein
forcing the exceptionalist narrative
that Stanford likes to encourage
about itself. That is absolutely true
but an overlooked aspect of this
confluence of academia and football
is the effect that it has on the play
ers. Condoleezza Rice's involvement
with the football team has been well
documented, but other members of
the faculty are similarly inclined. In
the same interview last year, Ander
son was candid about his view of the

academic-athletic complex.
"I think the professors here are
so important, because when you get
a chance to talk to them, you realize
how special a place this is," Ander
son said. "How these guys, who are
a number of Nobel Prize winners,
the top of their fields, the best of
what they do in the country
they're right here for you, and
they're interested in you not only as
a student-athlete, but truly as a stu
dent. They're there to help you to
get the best education possible, but
they're also interested in what
you're doing on the football field ...
They make a big impression on
kids."

It's clearly better for a team to
have good chemistry, and Anderson
is adamant that that is the case. Yet
nothing helps chemistry more than
winning. The 3-4 flex defense in
stalled by Vic Fangio and main
tained under Derek Mason
achieved national prominence for
shutting down explosive attacks
across the country. It's easy to un
derstand why Anderson wants to
keep that going.
Throughout Anderson's time at
Stanford, the Cardinal have relied
on him to train their pass rush. In
his first three years at Stanford,
when Stanford ran a 4-3 defense,
Anderson coached the defensive
line, from which a 4-3 defense gets
the bulk of its pass rush. In later
years, after Stanford switched to
the 3-4, Anderson trained the new
focus of the Cardinal's pressure sys
tem: the outside linebackers.
The effects were immediate. In
2006, the year before Anderson ar
rived at Stanford, Stanford record
ed 14 quarterback sacks, good for
109 th in the country and last in the
Pac-10. The next season, the Cardi
nal racked up 37 sacks, putting it in
the top 20. Three years later, the
Stanford pass rush led the confer
ence. For the last two years, Stan
ford has had the most dominant
pass rush in the country; in 2012,
armed with both Chase Thomas and
Trent Murphy, it recorded an awe
inspiring 57 takedowns.
Sacks aren't everything, of
course a team that gets a lot of
sacks but lacks solid play overall can
be a sieve on defense, and a pass
rush can cause havoc in the back
field without recording a sack at all.
But after adjusting for strength of
schedule and pace of play, the suc
cess of Stanford's defense as a unit
is readily apparent. It has been a

top-10 defense three out of the last
four years, and achieved national
notoriety for slowing down the ex
plosive Oregon Ducks in the teams'
last two matchups, both Stanford
wins. Last year, Stanford sacked
Oregon quarterback Marcus Mario
ta three times, forced him to fumble
twice and kept Oregon off the score
board board for a solid 50 minutes,
an almost hallucinogenic achieve
ment.
But as Stanford closed its 2009
campaign its final one under the
4-3 that sort of defensive domi
nation was too far into the future to
predict. While Anderson had consis
tently helped rack up great sack to
tals, even after three years, Stan
ford's defense as a unit hadn't per
formed to a similar standard. The
Cardinal decided to make a change.

The winning came when Stan
ford decided to get more flexible on
defense. The Pac-12 is arguably the
most offensively diverse conference
in college football, and in order to
escape conference play unscathed,
the Cardinal would have to tackle
spread-option run games (Oregon,
Utah and Arizona), pro-style teams
(USC, Washington, Oregon State
and Colorado), Air Raid passing
teams (Cal and Washington State)
and hybrid spread teams (UCLA
and Arizona State).

Fielding big, versatile lineback
ers and agile defensive linemen,
Stanford wanted to be able to switch
from a 3-4 to a 4-2-5 depending on
the situation and the opponent, with
as few substitutions as possible.
"I thought that [the 3-4] was a
very flexible system, one that could
give us maximum pressure, maxi
mum pass defense and a logical way
to play the run game that you see in
college football," Fangio says. "We
just thought it was a good, flexible,
all-encompassing, all-purpose pack
age."
"That first spring was just about
laying the foundation and making
sure that everybody understood
what their role was and what we
needed to do, series-by-series,"
Mason said in an interview for Rags
to Roses. "It was never going to be a
game-by-game situation. It was al
ways going to be series by series.
We wanted to win series, and then
win the next series, and then win the
next series, and, you know, before
you looked up, it was the end of a
ballgame."
Since Fangio a close friend of
Anderson introduced the 3-4 in
2010, Stanford's defense has been a
machine, incorporating the already
fearsome pass rush into a sound
overall scheme. Even though An
derson was coaching a new position,
Stanford's pass rush broke through

as well, leading the conference in
sacks for the first time.
"We've had a very similar defen
sive system in place [since then],"
Anderson says. "I think [the intro
duction of the 3-4] was when we re
ally started to break through defen
sively a little bit and have some suc
cess."
"The success that we started to
have defensively that year led to a
lot of confidence," he goes on. "[The
players] truly believed that we
could be a good defense that we
could be a preaMefense, that we
could eventually become a dominat
ing defense. It all started at that
point.
"Each year we've added a few
things, we've maybe deleted a few
things, tweaked a few things to fit
what we think our needs are," An
derson explains. "But overall, it's
stayed very similar... There are
not a lot of changes. If anything,
we're trying to maybe simplify
things a little bit so we don't have as
many levels of checks and adjust
ments, so that once we make a de
fensive call we can go out there and
play fast, get lined up and execute
the ca11... We want to be as funda
mentally sound as we possibly can."
"He pretty much knows what he
wants to d 0... We speak the same
language," Fangio says approvingly
when asked about Anderson. "He's
got a good knowledge of front play
and pressuring the quarterback, un
derstanding how you have to play
the coverage behind it... He'd like to
have a good mix of pressure and
strength defenses, and be able to in
terchange in and out of the emphasis
week to week by the opponent
they're playing.
"I think he brought to the prac
tice field an intensity and work ethic
that was contagious to the players,
that they respected and that he was
consistent with."
Anderson, for his part, is philo
sophical about his new position.
"Yes, we've had changes, head
coaching changes, other changes on
staff, but really those three going on
four years now, it's just the coaching
staff and the chemistry and the
bond, and everybody being on the
same page. It's just been remark
able. And I think that's one reason
too [for] all the success we've had.
It's been good coaches who know
what they're doing and guys that get
along well together. It's been fun."

In 2006, the last year before Lance Anderson (center) arrived, the Cardinal's
defense recorded a measly 14 sacks. Then in 2007, with Anderson
on the staff, Stanford racked up 37 sacks, ranking it among the top
20 in the nation in that category. Over the past two years, the Cardinal
finished first in the nation in sacks, including a 57-sackyear in 201 2 with
Chase Thomas (right) and Trent Murphy (left) manning the outside linebacker

ing defense. It all started at that
point.
"Each year we've added a few
things, we've maybe deleted a few
things, tweaked a few things to fit
what we think our needs are," An
derson explains. "But overall, it's
stayed very similar... There are
not a lot of changes. If anything,
we're trying to maybe simplify
things a little bit so we don't have as
many levels of checks and adjust
ments, so that once we make a de
fensive call we can go out there and
play fast, get lined up and execute
the ca11... We want to be as funda
mentally sound as we possibly can."
"He pretty much knows what he
wants to d 0... We speak the same
language," Fangio says approvingly
when asked about Anderson. "He's
got a good knowledge of front play
and pressuring the quarterback, un
derstanding how you have to play
the coverage behind it... He'd like to
have a good mix of pressure and
strength defenses, and be able to in
terchange in and out of the emphasis
week to week by the opponent
they're playing.
"I think he brought to the prac

that was contagious to the players,
that they respected and that he was

Anderson, for his part, is philo
sophical about his new position.
"Yes, we've had changes, head
coaching changes, other changes on
staff, but really those three going on
four years now, it's just the coaching
staff and the chemistry and the
bond, and everybody being on the

able. And I think that's one reason
too [for] all the success we've had.
It's been good coaches who know

In 2006, the last year before Lance Anderson (center) arrived, the Cardinal's
defense recorded a measly 14 sacks. Then in 2007, with Anderson
on the staff, Stanford racked up 37 sacks, ranking it among the top
20 in the nation in that category. Over the past two years, the Cardinal
finished first in the nation in sacks, including a 57-sackyear in 201 2 with
Chase Thomas (right) and Trent Murphy (left) manning the outside linebacker
positions en route to a victory in the Rose Bowl Game.
This is the second piece of a
three-part feature running this
week on Lance Anderson,
Stanford football's defensive
coordinator and ace recruiter,
now entering his eighth season
with Stanford football Part I
focused on Anderson's reshap
ing of Stanford's recruiting ap
paratus. Part II covers Ander
son's coaching and leadership
of the Cardinal defense. Tomor
row, Part 111 will cover Ander
son's life as a college coach.

Lance Anderson is a cor
nerstone of the reinvent
ed Stanford football pro
gram, a team enjoying
sustained success for the
first time since Pop Warner
roamed the sidelines. But while
Stanford football carries with it a
strong sense of newness, the na
ture of a cornerstone is that it does
not change.
In recruiting and redefining the
program, Anderson has been an
agent of change. But now that
Stanford has become more and

more successful, Anderson has
found himself charged with main
taining continuity on one of college
football's finest defenses, as well as
mentoring players across the ros
ter. While Anderson will naturally
have to adapt as the circumstances
surrounding Stanford inevitably
change, the task is now to maintain
the well-oiled machine that is the
Stanford defense and, hopeful
ly, to help push the team as a whole
to even greater glory.

Anderson may be focusing more
on his coaching role than on re
cruiting these days, but what does
that mean? Coaching isn't just call
ing plays from the press box during
games or running drills during
practice; a coach has to keep an eye
on every facet of his players' well
being. And while recruiting is a
huge part of a team's success,
coaching is a critical part of what
makes success possible.
When Anderson arrived on
Stanford's campus, it was clear that
there were a lot of things that had
to be fixed in order to repair the
program most importantly,
making sure that players were able
to play and in the right mind to play
in the first place.
Injuries were the first thing.
"We just realized that you can

have many good football players,
but if they're not able to practice
if they're not healthy it's hard to
have a good football team," Ander
son explains. "You can't get better
as a football player unless you're on
the field practicing, unless you're
on the field playing, and Shannon
[Turley, Stanford's director of
sports performance] has done a
great job with his program here of
not only developing guys physical
ly, helping them to get bigger,
faster, stronger, to become better
football players ... they've also
stayed healthy."
Better yet, that injury protec
tion extended not only to Stan
ford's oft-injured stars but the en
tire Cardinal roster, allowing Stan
ford's newer players to keep on de
veloping. From 2006 to 2012, Tur
ley helped cut the number of
games missed to injury among
Stanford's entire two-deep by a
staggering 87 percent.
Yet and Turley would agree
cutting injuries was not a cure
all to Stanford's problems. The is
sues were far more endemic and
systemic than that.
Managing the team's psycholo
gy both on and off the field was a
key component of Stanford's suc
cess. The importance of player re
locations is well known in profes

sional soccer, where high-priced
acquisitions often fail because of
culture shock, but it's perhaps less
important for most college football
teams, which play in a sport that is
still rather regional.
That doesn't hold for Stanford:
The Cardinal are the most national
team in the country, and it isn't
close. Since Anderson arrived on
campus, Stanford has drawn re
cruits from 33 different states. Its
players travel further to get to
campus than players at any other
program in the country; aside from
crunching the numbers on recruit
ing, statistician Dave Bartoo also
found that the average player on
the 2014 roster traveled over 1,400
miles in order to get to campus.
When Stanford players return
home for Christmas, the sum total
of their round-trip journeys is al
most 300,000 miles. That's farther
than the distance from the Earth
to the Moon.
With statistics like these, one
couldn't be faulted for wondering
how Stanford's program exists at
all. College football is a regional
sport for a reason; home cooking
has a statistically significant effect,
and going to a school across the
country typically cuts a recruit's

chances of making the NFL by 25
percent. Yet Stanford is one of the
nation's premier player develop
ment programs. Needless to say,
everyone is asking why.

There are a lot of factors that go
into a player's development in col
lege. Obviously traditional training,
from strength to playing technique
and education, is important. But the
mental aspect of playing football is
also important, and it's too often ig
nored: Players need to feel at home
on campus, and they need to feel at
home in the Stanford community.
Both of these things are easier
said than done. But they are never
theless necessary. The effect of
homesickness and feeling out of
place is real. While California will al
ways be the cornerstone of its roster,
if Stanford is going to be a good foot
ball team, it needs to make the entire
country its recruiting backyard.
"We have to go national just to
find the kids who are the level of stu
dent and the level of football player
that we want to recruit," Anderson
says. "Now, it is true that the further
you're away, the harder it is some
times, because you're passing up a
lot of other good schools, good pro
grams.
"I think that's just part of grow
ing up and part of going to college. I
think our kids do a pretty good job of
adjusting. And I think the reason for
that is, number one, here on campus,
they're surrounded by so many
great people who are from all over
the world. And I think that makes
the transition a little bit easier too,
because they know that they're not
the only ones in that boat. We signed
someone from the East Coast
coming from Washington, D.C., or
wherever he might be, he's not the
only one here that is coming a great
distance to go to school. There are a
lot of others in the same boat that
he's in, so I think there's a lot of oth
ers who can relate to him on the foot
ball team and at the University."
Keeping that atmosphere happy
is a key point for Anderson. Even
when talking to The Daily last year
for Rags to Roses, Anderson was
clear about the need to keep players
happy.
"They're here for a reason,
they're here to get an education, and
I think that's so powerful for those
kids. Chase Beeler [an Ail-American
offensive lineman] I think that
was a big part of why he transferred
and came to Stanford, because he
knew that he just didn't fit in at
Oklahoma," Anderson said. "He was
different than those kids. The only
thing he really had in common was
football, where here he had a lot of
stuff in common on the field, off the
field, and you want to surround
yourself with those kinds of kids. So
I think that's a bit of an important
thing, that we give them time to
spend with our players, away from
the coaches, where they can go and
hang out with them and spend some
time. That's important."
Similarly, it was also vital not
only to maintain chemistry within
the team but also within the Univer
sity. The football team has worked to
make football a greater part of the
Stanford community.
When Stanford professors are
honored during commercial breaks
in football games, fans sometimes
think that the purpose of doing so is
to underline the University's aca
demic and athletic prowess, rein
forcing the exceptionalist narrative
that Stanford likes to encourage
about itself. That is absolutely true
but an overlooked aspect of this
confluence of academia and football
is the effect that it has on the play
ers. Condoleezza Rice's involvement
with the football team has been well
documented, but other members of
the faculty are similarly inclined. In
the same interview last year, Ander
son was candid about his view of the

academic-athletic complex.
"I think the professors here are
so important, because when you get
a chance to talk to them, you realize
how special a place this is," Ander
son said. "How these guys, who are
a number of Nobel Prize winners,
the top of their fields, the best of
what they do in the country
they're right here for you, and
they're interested in you not only as
a student-athlete, but truly as a stu
dent. They're there to help you to
get the best education possible, but
they're also interested in what
you're doing on the football field ...
They make a big impression on
kids."

It's clearly better for a team to
have good chemistry, and Anderson
is adamant that that is the case. Yet
nothing helps chemistry more than
winning. The 3-4 flex defense in
stalled by Vic Fangio and main
tained under Derek Mason
achieved national prominence for
shutting down explosive attacks
across the country. It's easy to un
derstand why Anderson wants to
keep that going.
Throughout Anderson's time at
Stanford, the Cardinal have relied
on him to train their pass rush. In
his first three years at Stanford,
when Stanford ran a 4-3 defense,
Anderson coached the defensive
line, from which a 4-3 defense gets
the bulk of its pass rush. In later
years, after Stanford switched to
the 3-4, Anderson trained the new
focus of the Cardinal's pressure sys
tem: the outside linebackers.
The effects were immediate. In
2006, the year before Anderson ar
rived at Stanford, Stanford record
ed 14 quarterback sacks, good for
109 th in the country and last in the
Pac-10. The next season, the Cardi
nal racked up 37 sacks, putting it in
the top 20. Three years later, the
Stanford pass rush led the confer
ence. For the last two years, Stan
ford has had the most dominant
pass rush in the country; in 2012,
armed with both Chase Thomas and
Trent Murphy, it recorded an awe
inspiring 57 takedowns.
Sacks aren't everything, of
course a team that gets a lot of
sacks but lacks solid play overall can
be a sieve on defense, and a pass
rush can cause havoc in the back
field without recording a sack at all.
But after adjusting for strength of
schedule and pace of play, the suc
cess of Stanford's defense as a unit
is readily apparent. It has been a

top-10 defense three out of the last
four years, and achieved national
notoriety for slowing down the ex
plosive Oregon Ducks in the teams'
last two matchups, both Stanford
wins. Last year, Stanford sacked
Oregon quarterback Marcus Mario
ta three times, forced him to fumble
twice and kept Oregon off the score
board board for a solid 50 minutes,
an almost hallucinogenic achieve
ment.
But as Stanford closed its 2009
campaign its final one under the
4-3 that sort of defensive domi
nation was too far into the future to
predict. While Anderson had consis
tently helped rack up great sack to
tals, even after three years, Stan
ford's defense as a unit hadn't per
formed to a similar standard. The
Cardinal decided to make a change.

The winning came when Stan
ford decided to get more flexible on
defense. The Pac-12 is arguably the
most offensively diverse conference
in college football, and in order to
escape conference play unscathed,
the Cardinal would have to tackle
spread-option run games (Oregon,
Utah and Arizona), pro-style teams
(USC, Washington, Oregon State
and Colorado), Air Raid passing
teams (Cal and Washington State)
and hybrid spread teams (UCLA
and Arizona State).

Fielding big, versatile lineback
ers and agile defensive linemen,
Stanford wanted to be able to switch
from a 3-4 to a 4-2-5 depending on
the situation and the opponent, with
as few substitutions as possible.
"I thought that [the 3-4] was a
very flexible system, one that could
give us maximum pressure, maxi
mum pass defense and a logical way
to play the run game that you see in
college football," Fangio says. "We
just thought it was a good, flexible,
all-encompassing, all-purpose pack
age."
"That first spring was just about
laying the foundation and making
sure that everybody understood
what their role was and what we
needed to do, series-by-series,"
Mason said in an interview for Rags
to Roses. "It was never going to be a
game-by-game situation. It was al
ways going to be series by series.
We wanted to win series, and then
win the next series, and then win the
next series, and, you know, before
you looked up, it was the end of a
ballgame."
Since Fangio a close friend of
Anderson introduced the 3-4 in
2010, Stanford's defense has been a
machine, incorporating the already
fearsome pass rush into a sound
overall scheme. Even though An
derson was coaching a new position,
Stanford's pass rush broke through

as well, leading the conference in
sacks for the first time.
"We've had a very similar defen
sive system in place [since then],"
Anderson says. "I think [the intro
duction of the 3-4] was when we re
ally started to break through defen
sively a little bit and have some suc
cess."
"The success that we started to
have defensively that year led to a
lot of confidence," he goes on. "[The
players] truly believed that we
could be a good defense that we
could be a preaMefense, that we
could eventually become a dominat
ing defense. It all started at that
point.
"Each year we've added a few
things, we've maybe deleted a few
things, tweaked a few things to fit
what we think our needs are," An
derson explains. "But overall, it's
stayed very similar... There are
not a lot of changes. If anything,
we're trying to maybe simplify
things a little bit so we don't have as
many levels of checks and adjust
ments, so that once we make a de
fensive call we can go out there and
play fast, get lined up and execute
the ca11... We want to be as funda
mentally sound as we possibly can."
"He pretty much knows what he
wants to d 0... We speak the same
language," Fangio says approvingly
when asked about Anderson. "He's
got a good knowledge of front play
and pressuring the quarterback, un
derstanding how you have to play
the coverage behind it... He'd like to
have a good mix of pressure and
strength defenses, and be able to in
terchange in and out of the emphasis
week to week by the opponent
they're playing.
"I think he brought to the prac
tice field an intensity and work ethic
that was contagious to the players,
that they respected and that he was
consistent with."
Anderson, for his part, is philo
sophical about his new position.
"Yes, we've had changes, head
coaching changes, other changes on
staff, but really those three going on
four years now, it's just the coaching
staff and the chemistry and the
bond, and everybody being on the
same page. It's just been remark
able. And I think that's one reason

It's been good coaches who know
what they're doing and guys that get
along well together. It's been fun."

formed to a similar standard. The
Cardinal decided to make a change.

The winning came when Stan
ford decided to get more flexible on
defense. The Pac-12 is arguably the
most offensively diverse conference
in college football, and in order to
escape conference play unscathed,
the Cardinal would have to tackle
spread-option run games (Oregon,
Utah and Arizona), pro-style teams
(USC, Washington, Oregon State
and Colorado), Air Raid passing
teams (Cal and Washington State)
and hybrid spread teams (UCLA
and Arizona State).

Fielding big, versatile lineback
ers and agile defensive linemen,
Stanford wanted to be able to switch
from a 3-4 to a 4-2-5 depending on
the situation and the opponent, with
as few substitutions as possible.
"I thought that [the 3-4] was a
very flexible system, one that could
give us maximum pressure, maxi
mum pass defense and a logical way
to play the run game that you see in
college football," Fangio says. "We
just thought it was a good, flexible,
all-encompassing, all-purpose pack
age."
"That first spring was just about
laying the foundation and making
sure that everybody understood
what their role was and what we
needed to do, series-by-series,"
Mason said in an interview for Rags
to Roses. "It was never going to be a
game-by-game situation. It was al
ways going to be series by series.
We wanted to win series, and then
win the next series, and then win the
next series, and, you know, before
you looked up, it was the end of a
ballgame."
Since Fangio a close friend of
Anderson introduced the 3-4 in
2010, Stanford's defense has been a
machine, incorporating the already
fearsome pass rush into a sound
overall scheme. Even though An
derson was coaching a new position,
Stanford's pass rush broke through

as well, leading the conference in
sacks for the first time.
"We've had a very similar defen
sive system in place [since then],"
Anderson says. "I think [the intro
duction of the 3-4] was when we re
ally started to break through defen
sively a little bit and have some suc
cess."
"The success that we started to
have defensively that year led to a
lot of confidence," he goes on. "[The
players] truly believed that we
could be a good defense that we
could be a preaMefense, that we
could eventually become a dominat
ing defense. It all started at that
point.
"Each year we've added a few
things, we've maybe deleted a few
things, tweaked a few things to fit
what we think our needs are," An
derson explains. "But overall, it's
stayed very similar... There are
not a lot of changes. If anything,
we're trying to maybe simplify
things a little bit so we don't have as
many levels of checks and adjust
ments, so that once we make a de
fensive call we can go out there and
play fast, get lined up and execute
the ca11... We want to be as funda
mentally sound as we possibly can."
"He pretty much knows what he
wants to d 0... We speak the same
language," Fangio says approvingly
when asked about Anderson. "He's
got a good knowledge of front play
and pressuring the quarterback, un
derstanding how you have to play
the coverage behind it... He'd like to
have a good mix of pressure and
strength defenses, and be able to in
terchange in and out of the emphasis
week to week by the opponent
they're playing.
"I think he brought to the prac
tice field an intensity and work ethic
that was contagious to the players,
that they respected and that he was
consistent with."
Anderson, for his part, is philo
sophical about his new position.
"Yes, we've had changes, head
coaching changes, other changes on
staff, but really those three going on
four years now, it's just the coaching
staff and the chemistry and the
bond, and everybody being on the
same page. It's just been remark
able. And I think that's one reason
too [for] all the success we've had.
It's been good coaches who know
what they're doing and guys that get
along well together. It's been fun."

In 2006, the last year before Lance Anderson (center) arrived, the Cardinal's
defense recorded a measly 14 sacks. Then in 2007, with Anderson
on the staff, Stanford racked up 37 sacks, ranking it among the top
20 in the nation in that category. Over the past two years, the Cardinal
finished first in the nation in sacks, including a 57-sackyear in 201 2 with
Chase Thomas (right) and Trent Murphy (left) manning the outside linebacker
positions en route to a victory in the Rose Bowl Game.
This is the second piece of a
three-part feature running this
week on Lance Anderson,
Stanford football's defensive
coordinator and ace recruiter,
now entering his eighth season
with Stanford football Part I
focused on Anderson's reshap
ing of Stanford's recruiting ap
paratus. Part II covers Ander
son's coaching and leadership
of the Cardinal defense. Tomor
row, Part 111 will cover Ander
son's life as a college coach.

Lance Anderson is a cor
nerstone of the reinvent
ed Stanford football pro
gram, a team enjoying
sustained success for the
first time since Pop Warner
roamed the sidelines. But while
Stanford football carries with it a
strong sense of newness, the na
ture of a cornerstone is that it does
not change.
In recruiting and redefining the
program, Anderson has been an
agent of change. But now that
Stanford has become more and

more successful, Anderson has
found himself charged with main
taining continuity on one of college
football's finest defenses, as well as
mentoring players across the ros
ter. While Anderson will naturally
have to adapt as the circumstances
surrounding Stanford inevitably
change, the task is now to maintain
the well-oiled machine that is the
Stanford defense and, hopeful
ly, to help push the team as a whole
to even greater glory.

Anderson may be focusing more
on his coaching role than on re
cruiting these days, but what does
that mean? Coaching isn't just call
ing plays from the press box during
games or running drills during
practice; a coach has to keep an eye
on every facet of his players' well
being. And while recruiting is a
huge part of a team's success,
coaching is a critical part of what
makes success possible.
When Anderson arrived on
Stanford's campus, it was clear that
there were a lot of things that had
to be fixed in order to repair the
program most importantly,
making sure that players were able
to play and in the right mind to play
in the first place.
Injuries were the first thing.
"We just realized that you can

have many good football players,
but if they're not able to practice
if they're not healthy it's hard to
have a good football team," Ander
son explains. "You can't get better
as a football player unless you're on
the field practicing, unless you're
on the field playing, and Shannon
[Turley, Stanford's director of
sports performance] has done a
great job with his program here of
not only developing guys physical
ly, helping them to get bigger,
faster, stronger, to become better
football players ... they've also
stayed healthy."
Better yet, that injury protec
tion extended not only to Stan
ford's oft-injured stars but the en
tire Cardinal roster, allowing Stan
ford's newer players to keep on de
veloping. From 2006 to 2012, Tur
ley helped cut the number of
games missed to injury among
Stanford's entire two-deep by a
staggering 87 percent.
Yet and Turley would agree
cutting injuries was not a cure
all to Stanford's problems. The is
sues were far more endemic and
systemic than that.
Managing the team's psycholo
gy both on and off the field was a
key component of Stanford's suc
cess. The importance of player re
locations is well known in profes

sional soccer, where high-priced
acquisitions often fail because of
culture shock, but it's perhaps less
important for most college football
teams, which play in a sport that is
still rather regional.
That doesn't hold for Stanford:
The Cardinal are the most national
team in the country, and it isn't
close. Since Anderson arrived on
campus, Stanford has drawn re
cruits from 33 different states. Its
players travel further to get to
campus than players at any other
program in the country; aside from
crunching the numbers on recruit
ing, statistician Dave Bartoo also
found that the average player on
the 2014 roster traveled over 1,400
miles in order to get to campus.
When Stanford players return
home for Christmas, the sum total
of their round-trip journeys is al
most 300,000 miles. That's farther
than the distance from the Earth
to the Moon.
With statistics like these, one
couldn't be faulted for wondering
how Stanford's program exists at
all. College football is a regional
sport for a reason; home cooking
has a statistically significant effect,
and going to a school across the
country typically cuts a recruit's

coordinators Vic Fangio and Derek Mason. Anderson, a recruiting extraordinaire, will look to emulate their prior success in his new role.
chances of making the NFL by 25
percent. Yet Stanford is one of the
nation's premier player develop
ment programs. Needless to say,
everyone is asking why.

There are a lot of factors that go
into a player's development in col
lege. Obviously traditional training,
from strength to playing technique
and education, is important. But the
mental aspect of playing football is
also important, and it's too often ig
nored: Players need to feel at home
on campus, and they need to feel at
home in the Stanford community.
Both of these things are easier
said than done. But they are never
theless necessary. The effect of
homesickness and feeling out of
place is real. While California will al
ways be the cornerstone of its roster,
if Stanford is going to be a good foot
ball team, it needs to make the entire
country its recruiting backyard.
"We have to go national just to
find the kids who are the level of stu
dent and the level of football player
that we want to recruit," Anderson
says. "Now, it is true that the further
you're away, the harder it is some
times, because you're passing up a
lot of other good schools, good pro
grams.
"I think that's just part of grow
ing up and part of going to college. I
think our kids do a pretty good job of
adjusting. And I think the reason for
that is, number one, here on campus,
they're surrounded by so many
great people who are from all over
the world. And I think that makes
the transition a little bit easier too,
because they know that they're not
the only ones in that boat. We signed
someone from the East Coast
coming from Washington, D.C., or
wherever he might be, he's not the
only one here that is coming a great
distance to go to school. There are a
lot of others in the same boat that
he's in, so I think there's a lot of oth
ers who can relate to him on the foot
ball team and at the University."
Keeping that atmosphere happy
is a key point for Anderson. Even
when talking to The Daily last year
for Rags to Roses, Anderson was
clear about the need to keep players
happy.
"They're here for a reason,
they're here to get an education, and
I think that's so powerful for those
kids. Chase Beeler [an Ail-American
offensive lineman] I think that
was a big part of why he transferred
and came to Stanford, because he
knew that he just didn't fit in at
Oklahoma," Anderson said. "He was
different than those kids. The only
thing he really had in common was
football, where here he had a lot of
stuff in common on the field, off the
field, and you want to surround
yourself with those kinds of kids. So
I think that's a bit of an important
thing, that we give them time to
spend with our players, away from
the coaches, where they can go and
hang out with them and spend some
time. That's important."
Similarly, it was also vital not
only to maintain chemistry within
the team but also within the Univer
sity. The football team has worked to
make football a greater part of the
Stanford community.
When Stanford professors are
honored during commercial breaks
in football games, fans sometimes
think that the purpose of doing so is
to underline the University's aca
demic and athletic prowess, rein
forcing the exceptionalist narrative
that Stanford likes to encourage
about itself. That is absolutely true
but an overlooked aspect of this
confluence of academia and football
is the effect that it has on the play
ers. Condoleezza Rice's involvement
with the football team has been well
documented, but other members of
the faculty are similarly inclined. In
the same interview last year, Ander
son was candid about his view of the

academic-athletic complex.
"I think the professors here are
so important, because when you get
a chance to talk to them, you realize
how special a place this is," Ander
son said. "How these guys, who are
a number of Nobel Prize winners,
the top of their fields, the best of
what they do in the country
they're right here for you, and
they're interested in you not only as
a student-athlete, but truly as a stu
dent. They're there to help you to
get the best education possible, but
they're also interested in what
you're doing on the football field ...
They make a big impression on
kids."

It's clearly better for a team to
have good chemistry, and Anderson
is adamant that that is the case. Yet
nothing helps chemistry more than
winning. The 3-4 flex defense in
stalled by Vic Fangio and main
tained under Derek Mason
achieved national prominence for
shutting down explosive attacks
across the country. It's easy to un
derstand why Anderson wants to
keep that going.
Throughout Anderson's time at
Stanford, the Cardinal have relied
on him to train their pass rush. In
his first three years at Stanford,
when Stanford ran a 4-3 defense,
Anderson coached the defensive
line, from which a 4-3 defense gets
the bulk of its pass rush. In later
years, after Stanford switched to
the 3-4, Anderson trained the new
focus of the Cardinal's pressure sys
tem: the outside linebackers.
The effects were immediate. In
2006, the year before Anderson ar
rived at Stanford, Stanford record
ed 14 quarterback sacks, good for
109 th in the country and last in the
Pac-10. The next season, the Cardi
nal racked up 37 sacks, putting it in
the top 20. Three years later, the
Stanford pass rush led the confer
ence. For the last two years, Stan
ford has had the most dominant
pass rush in the country; in 2012,
armed with both Chase Thomas and
Trent Murphy, it recorded an awe
inspiring 57 takedowns.
Sacks aren't everything, of
course a team that gets a lot of
sacks but lacks solid play overall can
be a sieve on defense, and a pass
rush can cause havoc in the back
field without recording a sack at all.
But after adjusting for strength of
schedule and pace of play, the suc
cess of Stanford's defense as a unit
is readily apparent. It has been a

top-10 defense three out of the last
four years, and achieved national
notoriety for slowing down the ex
plosive Oregon Ducks in the teams'
last two matchups, both Stanford
wins. Last year, Stanford sacked
Oregon quarterback Marcus Mario
ta three times, forced him to fumble
twice and kept Oregon off the score
board board for a solid 50 minutes,
an almost hallucinogenic achieve
ment.
But as Stanford closed its 2009
campaign its final one under the
4-3 that sort of defensive domi
nation was too far into the future to
predict. While Anderson had consis
tently helped rack up great sack to
tals, even after three years, Stan
ford's defense as a unit hadn't per
formed to a similar standard. The
Cardinal decided to make a change.

The winning came when Stan
ford decided to get more flexible on
defense. The Pac-12 is arguably the
most offensively diverse conference
in college football, and in order to
escape conference play unscathed,
the Cardinal would have to tackle
spread-option run games (Oregon,
Utah and Arizona), pro-style teams
(USC, Washington, Oregon State
and Colorado), Air Raid passing
teams (Cal and Washington State)
and hybrid spread teams (UCLA
and Arizona State).

Fielding big, versatile lineback
ers and agile defensive linemen,
Stanford wanted to be able to switch
from a 3-4 to a 4-2-5 depending on
the situation and the opponent, with
as few substitutions as possible.
"I thought that [the 3-4] was a
very flexible system, one that could
give us maximum pressure, maxi
mum pass defense and a logical way
to play the run game that you see in
college football," Fangio says. "We
just thought it was a good, flexible,
all-encompassing, all-purpose pack
age."
"That first spring was just about
laying the foundation and making
sure that everybody understood
what their role was and what we
needed to do, series-by-series,"
Mason said in an interview for Rags
to Roses. "It was never going to be a
game-by-game situation. It was al
ways going to be series by series.

have good chemistry, and Anderson
is adamant that that is the case. Yet
nothing helps chemistry more than
winning. The 3-4 flex defense in
stalled by Vic Fangio and main
tained under Derek Mason
achieved national prominence for
shutting down explosive attacks
across the country. It's easy to un
derstand why Anderson wants to
keep that going.
Throughout Anderson's time at
Stanford, the Cardinal have relied
on him to train their pass rush. In
his first three years at Stanford,
when Stanford ran a 4-3 defense,
Anderson coached the defensive
line, from which a 4-3 defense gets
the bulk of its pass rush. In later
years, after Stanford switched to
the 3-4, Anderson trained the new
focus of the Cardinal's pressure sys
tem: the outside linebackers.
The effects were immediate. In
2006, the year before Anderson ar
rived at Stanford, Stanford record
ed 14 quarterback sacks, good for
109 th in the country and last in the
Pac-10. The next season, the Cardi
nal racked up 37 sacks, putting it in
the top 20. Three years later, the
Stanford pass rush led the confer
ence. For the last two years, Stan
ford has had the most dominant
pass rush in the country; in 2012,
armed with both Chase Thomas and
Trent Murphy, it recorded an awe
inspiring 57 takedowns.
Sacks aren't everything, of
course a team that gets a lot of
sacks but lacks solid play overall can
be a sieve on defense, and a pass
rush can cause havoc in the back
field without recording a sack at all.
But after adjusting for strength of
schedule and pace of play, the suc
cess of Stanford's defense as a unit
is readily apparent. It has been a

top-10 defense three out of the last
four years, and achieved national
notoriety for slowing down the ex
plosive Oregon Ducks in the teams'
last two matchups, both Stanford
wins. Last year, Stanford sacked
Oregon quarterback Marcus Mario
ta three times, forced him to fumble
twice and kept Oregon off the score
board board for a solid 50 minutes,
an almost hallucinogenic achieve
ment.
But as Stanford closed its 2009
campaign its final one under the
4-3 that sort of defensive domi
nation was too far into the future to
predict. While Anderson had consis
tently helped rack up great sack to
tals, even after three years, Stan
ford's defense as a unit hadn't per
formed to a similar standard. The
Cardinal decided to make a change.

The winning came when Stan
ford decided to get more flexible on
defense. The Pac-12 is arguably the
most offensively diverse conference
in college football, and in order to
escape conference play unscathed,
the Cardinal would have to tackle
spread-option run games (Oregon,
Utah and Arizona), pro-style teams
(USC, Washington, Oregon State
and Colorado), Air Raid passing
teams (Cal and Washington State)
and hybrid spread teams (UCLA
and Arizona State).

Fielding big, versatile lineback
ers and agile defensive linemen,
Stanford wanted to be able to switch
from a 3-4 to a 4-2-5 depending on
the situation and the opponent, with
as few substitutions as possible.
"I thought that [the 3-4] was a
very flexible system, one that could
give us maximum pressure, maxi
mum pass defense and a logical way
to play the run game that you see in
college football," Fangio says. "We
just thought it was a good, flexible,
all-encompassing, all-purpose pack
age."
"That first spring was just about
laying the foundation and making
sure that everybody understood
what their role was and what we
needed to do, series-by-series,"
Mason said in an interview for Rags
to Roses. "It was never going to be a
game-by-game situation. It was al
ways going to be series by series.
We wanted to win series, and then
win the next series, and then win the
next series, and, you know, before
you looked up, it was the end of a
ballgame."
Since Fangio a close friend of
Anderson introduced the 3-4 in
2010, Stanford's defense has been a
machine, incorporating the already
fearsome pass rush into a sound
overall scheme. Even though An
derson was coaching a new position,
Stanford's pass rush broke through

as well, leading the conference in
sacks for the first time.
"We've had a very similar defen
sive system in place [since then],"
Anderson says. "I think [the intro
duction of the 3-4] was when we re
ally started to break through defen
sively a little bit and have some suc
cess."
"The success that we started to
have defensively that year led to a
lot of confidence," he goes on. "[The
players] truly believed that we
could be a good defense that we
could be a preaMefense, that we
could eventually become a dominat
ing defense. It all started at that
point.
"Each year we've added a few
things, we've maybe deleted a few
things, tweaked a few things to fit
what we think our needs are," An
derson explains. "But overall, it's
stayed very similar... There are
not a lot of changes. If anything,
we're trying to maybe simplify
things a little bit so we don't have as
many levels of checks and adjust
ments, so that once we make a de
fensive call we can go out there and
play fast, get lined up and execute
the ca11... We want to be as funda
mentally sound as we possibly can."
"He pretty much knows what he
wants to d 0... We speak the same
language," Fangio says approvingly
when asked about Anderson. "He's
got a good knowledge of front play
and pressuring the quarterback, un
derstanding how you have to play
the coverage behind it... He'd like to
have a good mix of pressure and
strength defenses, and be able to in
terchange in and out of the emphasis
week to week by the opponent
they're playing.
"I think he brought to the prac
tice field an intensity and work ethic
that was contagious to the players,
that they respected and that he was
consistent with."
Anderson, for his part, is philo
sophical about his new position.
"Yes, we've had changes, head
coaching changes, other changes on
staff, but really those three going on
four years now, it's just the coaching
staff and the chemistry and the
bond, and everybody being on the
same page. It's just been remark
able. And I think that's one reason
too [for] all the success we've had.
It's been good coaches who know
what they're doing and guys that get
along well together. It's been fun."

In 2006, the last year before Lance Anderson (center) arrived, the Cardinal's
defense recorded a measly 14 sacks. Then in 2007, with Anderson
on the staff, Stanford racked up 37 sacks, ranking it among the top
20 in the nation in that category. Over the past two years, the Cardinal
finished first in the nation in sacks, including a 57-sackyear in 201 2 with
Chase Thomas (right) and Trent Murphy (left) manning the outside linebacker
positions en route to a victory in the Rose Bowl Game.
This is the second piece of a
three-part feature running this
week on Lance Anderson,
Stanford football's defensive
coordinator and ace recruiter,
now entering his eighth season
with Stanford football Part I
focused on Anderson's reshap
ing of Stanford's recruiting ap
paratus. Part II covers Ander
son's coaching and leadership
of the Cardinal defense. Tomor
row, Part 111 will cover Ander
son's life as a college coach.

Lance Anderson is a cor
nerstone of the reinvent
ed Stanford football pro
gram, a team enjoying
sustained success for the
first time since Pop Warner
roamed the sidelines. But while
Stanford football carries with it a
strong sense of newness, the na
ture of a cornerstone is that it does
not change.
In recruiting and redefining the
program, Anderson has been an
agent of change. But now that
Stanford has become more and

more successful, Anderson has
found himself charged with main
taining continuity on one of college
football's finest defenses, as well as
mentoring players across the ros
ter. While Anderson will naturally
have to adapt as the circumstances
surrounding Stanford inevitably
change, the task is now to maintain
the well-oiled machine that is the
Stanford defense and, hopeful
ly, to help push the team as a whole
to even greater glory.

Anderson may be focusing more
on his coaching role than on re
cruiting these days, but what does
that mean? Coaching isn't just call
ing plays from the press box during
games or running drills during
practice; a coach has to keep an eye
on every facet of his players' well
being. And while recruiting is a
huge part of a team's success,
coaching is a critical part of what
makes success possible.
When Anderson arrived on
Stanford's campus, it was clear that
there were a lot of things that had
to be fixed in order to repair the
program most importantly,
making sure that players were able
to play and in the right mind to play
in the first place.
Injuries were the first thing.
"We just realized that you can

have many good football players,
but if they're not able to practice
if they're not healthy it's hard to
have a good football team," Ander
son explains. "You can't get better
as a football player unless you're on
the field practicing, unless you're
on the field playing, and Shannon
[Turley, Stanford's director of
sports performance] has done a
great job with his program here of
not only developing guys physical
ly, helping them to get bigger,
faster, stronger, to become better
football players ... they've also
stayed healthy."
Better yet, that injury protec
tion extended not only to Stan
ford's oft-injured stars but the en
tire Cardinal roster, allowing Stan
ford's newer players to keep on de
veloping. From 2006 to 2012, Tur
ley helped cut the number of
games missed to injury among
Stanford's entire two-deep by a
staggering 87 percent.
Yet and Turley would agree
cutting injuries was not a cure
all to Stanford's problems. The is
sues were far more endemic and
systemic than that.
Managing the team's psycholo
gy both on and off the field was a
key component of Stanford's suc
cess. The importance of player re
locations is well known in profes

sional soccer, where high-priced
acquisitions often fail because of
culture shock, but it's perhaps less
important for most college football
teams, which play in a sport that is
still rather regional.
That doesn't hold for Stanford:
The Cardinal are the most national
team in the country, and it isn't
close. Since Anderson arrived on
campus, Stanford has drawn re
cruits from 33 different states. Its
players travel further to get to
campus than players at any other
program in the country; aside from
crunching the numbers on recruit
ing, statistician Dave Bartoo also
found that the average player on
the 2014 roster traveled over 1,400
miles in order to get to campus.
When Stanford players return
home for Christmas, the sum total
of their round-trip journeys is al
most 300,000 miles. That's farther
than the distance from the Earth
to the Moon.
With statistics like these, one
couldn't be faulted for wondering
how Stanford's program exists at
all. College football is a regional
sport for a reason; home cooking
has a statistically significant effect,
and going to a school across the
country typically cuts a recruit's

coordinators Vic Fangio and Derek Mason. Anderson, a recruiting extraordinaire, will look to emulate their prior success in his new role.
chances of making the NFL by 25
percent. Yet Stanford is one of the
nation's premier player develop
ment programs. Needless to say,
everyone is asking why.

There are a lot of factors that go
into a player's development in col
lege. Obviously traditional training,
from strength to playing technique
and education, is important. But the
mental aspect of playing football is
also important, and it's too often ig
nored: Players need to feel at home
on campus, and they need to feel at
home in the Stanford community.
Both of these things are easier
said than done. But they are never
theless necessary. The effect of
homesickness and feeling out of
place is real. While California will al
ways be the cornerstone of its roster,
if Stanford is going to be a good foot
ball team, it needs to make the entire
country its recruiting backyard.
"We have to go national just to
find the kids who are the level of stu
dent and the level of football player
that we want to recruit," Anderson
says. "Now, it is true that the further
you're away, the harder it is some
times, because you're passing up a
lot of other good schools, good pro
grams.
"I think that's just part of grow
ing up and part of going to college. I
think our kids do a pretty good job of
adjusting. And I think the reason for
that is, number one, here on campus,
they're surrounded by so many
great people who are from all over
the world. And I think that makes
the transition a little bit easier too,
because they know that they're not
the only ones in that boat. We signed
someone from the East Coast
coming from Washington, D.C., or
wherever he might be, he's not the
only one here that is coming a great
distance to go to school. There are a
lot of others in the same boat that
he's in, so I think there's a lot of oth
ers who can relate to him on the foot
ball team and at the University."
Keeping that atmosphere happy
is a key point for Anderson. Even
when talking to The Daily last year
for Rags to Roses, Anderson was
clear about the need to keep players
happy.
"They're here for a reason,
they're here to get an education, and
I think that's so powerful for those
kids. Chase Beeler [an Ail-American
offensive lineman] I think that
was a big part of why he transferred
and came to Stanford, because he
knew that he just didn't fit in at
Oklahoma," Anderson said. "He was
different than those kids. The only
thing he really had in common was
football, where here he had a lot of
stuff in common on the field, off the
field, and you want to surround
yourself with those kinds of kids. So
I think that's a bit of an important
thing, that we give them time to
spend with our players, away from
the coaches, where they can go and
hang out with them and spend some
time. That's important."
Similarly, it was also vital not
only to maintain chemistry within
the team but also within the Univer
sity. The football team has worked to
make football a greater part of the
Stanford community.
When Stanford professors are
honored during commercial breaks
in football games, fans sometimes
think that the purpose of doing so is
to underline the University's aca
demic and athletic prowess, rein
forcing the exceptionalist narrative
that Stanford likes to encourage
about itself. That is absolutely true
but an overlooked aspect of this
confluence of academia and football
is the effect that it has on the play
ers. Condoleezza Rice's involvement
with the football team has been well
documented, but other members of
the faculty are similarly inclined. In
the same interview last year, Ander
son was candid about his view of the

academic-athletic complex.
"I think the professors here are
so important, because when you get
a chance to talk to them, you realize
how special a place this is," Ander
son said. "How these guys, who are
a number of Nobel Prize winners,
the top of their fields, the best of
what they do in the country
they're right here for you, and
they're interested in you not only as
a student-athlete, but truly as a stu
dent. They're there to help you to
get the best education possible, but
they're also interested in what
you're doing on the football field ...
They make a big impression on
kids."

It's clearly better for a team to
have good chemistry, and Anderson
is adamant that that is the case. Yet
nothing helps chemistry more than
winning. The 3-4 flex defense in
stalled by Vic Fangio and main
tained under Derek Mason
achieved national prominence for
shutting down explosive attacks
across the country. It's easy to un
derstand why Anderson wants to
keep that going.

Keeping that atmosphere happy
is a key point for Anderson. Even
when talking to The Daily last year
for Rags to Roses, Anderson was
clear about the need to keep players
happy.
"They're here for a reason,
they're here to get an education, and
I think that's so powerful for those
kids. Chase Beeler [an Ail-American
offensive lineman] I think that
was a big part of why he transferred
and came to Stanford, because he
knew that he just didn't fit in at
Oklahoma," Anderson said. "He was
different than those kids. The only
thing he really had in common was
football, where here he had a lot of
stuff in common on the field, off the
field, and you want to surround
yourself with those kinds of kids. So
I think that's a bit of an important
thing, that we give them time to
spend with our players, away from
the coaches, where they can go and
hang out with them and spend some
time. That's important."
Similarly, it was also vital not
only to maintain chemistry within
the team but also within the Univer
sity. The football team has worked to
make football a greater part of the
Stanford community.
When Stanford professors are
honored during commercial breaks
in football games, fans sometimes
think that the purpose of doing so is
to underline the University's aca
demic and athletic prowess, rein
forcing the exceptionalist narrative
that Stanford likes to encourage
about itself. That is absolutely true
but an overlooked aspect of this
confluence of academia and football
is the effect that it has on the play
ers. Condoleezza Rice's involvement
with the football team has been well
documented, but other members of
the faculty are similarly inclined. In
the same interview last year, Ander
son was candid about his view of the

academic-athletic complex.
"I think the professors here are
so important, because when you get
a chance to talk to them, you realize
how special a place this is," Ander
son said. "How these guys, who are
a number of Nobel Prize winners,
the top of their fields, the best of
what they do in the country
they're right here for you, and
they're interested in you not only as
a student-athlete, but truly as a stu
dent. They're there to help you to
get the best education possible, but
they're also interested in what
you're doing on the football field ...
They make a big impression on
kids."

It's clearly better for a team to
have good chemistry, and Anderson
is adamant that that is the case. Yet
nothing helps chemistry more than
winning. The 3-4 flex defense in
stalled by Vic Fangio and main
tained under Derek Mason
achieved national prominence for
shutting down explosive attacks
across the country. It's easy to un
derstand why Anderson wants to
keep that going.
Throughout Anderson's time at
Stanford, the Cardinal have relied
on him to train their pass rush. In
his first three years at Stanford,
when Stanford ran a 4-3 defense,
Anderson coached the defensive
line, from which a 4-3 defense gets
the bulk of its pass rush. In later
years, after Stanford switched to
the 3-4, Anderson trained the new
focus of the Cardinal's pressure sys
tem: the outside linebackers.
The effects were immediate. In
2006, the year before Anderson ar
rived at Stanford, Stanford record
ed 14 quarterback sacks, good for
109 th in the country and last in the
Pac-10. The next season, the Cardi
nal racked up 37 sacks, putting it in
the top 20. Three years later, the
Stanford pass rush led the confer
ence. For the last two years, Stan
ford has had the most dominant
pass rush in the country; in 2012,
armed with both Chase Thomas and
Trent Murphy, it recorded an awe
inspiring 57 takedowns.
Sacks aren't everything, of
course a team that gets a lot of
sacks but lacks solid play overall can
be a sieve on defense, and a pass
rush can cause havoc in the back
field without recording a sack at all.
But after adjusting for strength of
schedule and pace of play, the suc
cess of Stanford's defense as a unit
is readily apparent. It has been a

top-10 defense three out of the last
four years, and achieved national
notoriety for slowing down the ex
plosive Oregon Ducks in the teams'
last two matchups, both Stanford
wins. Last year, Stanford sacked
Oregon quarterback Marcus Mario
ta three times, forced him to fumble
twice and kept Oregon off the score
board board for a solid 50 minutes,
an almost hallucinogenic achieve
ment.
But as Stanford closed its 2009
campaign its final one under the
4-3 that sort of defensive domi
nation was too far into the future to
predict. While Anderson had consis
tently helped rack up great sack to
tals, even after three years, Stan
ford's defense as a unit hadn't per
formed to a similar standard. The
Cardinal decided to make a change.

The winning came when Stan
ford decided to get more flexible on
defense. The Pac-12 is arguably the
most offensively diverse conference
in college football, and in order to
escape conference play unscathed,
the Cardinal would have to tackle
spread-option run games (Oregon,
Utah and Arizona), pro-style teams
(USC, Washington, Oregon State
and Colorado), Air Raid passing
teams (Cal and Washington State)
and hybrid spread teams (UCLA
and Arizona State).

Fielding big, versatile lineback
ers and agile defensive linemen,
Stanford wanted to be able to switch
from a 3-4 to a 4-2-5 depending on
the situation and the opponent, with
as few substitutions as possible.
"I thought that [the 3-4] was a
very flexible system, one that could
give us maximum pressure, maxi
mum pass defense and a logical way
to play the run game that you see in
college football," Fangio says. "We
just thought it was a good, flexible,
all-encompassing, all-purpose pack
age."
"That first spring was just about
laying the foundation and making
sure that everybody understood
what their role was and what we
needed to do, series-by-series,"
Mason said in an interview for Rags
to Roses. "It was never going to be a
game-by-game situation. It was al
ways going to be series by series.
We wanted to win series, and then
win the next series, and then win the
next series, and, you know, before
you looked up, it was the end of a
ballgame."
Since Fangio a close friend of
Anderson introduced the 3-4 in
2010, Stanford's defense has been a
machine, incorporating the already
fearsome pass rush into a sound
overall scheme. Even though An
derson was coaching a new position,
Stanford's pass rush broke through

as well, leading the conference in
sacks for the first time.
"We've had a very similar defen
sive system in place [since then],"
Anderson says. "I think [the intro
duction of the 3-4] was when we re
ally started to break through defen
sively a little bit and have some suc
cess."
"The success that we started to
have defensively that year led to a
lot of confidence," he goes on. "[The
players] truly believed that we
could be a good defense that we
could be a preaMefense, that we
could eventually become a dominat
ing defense. It all started at that
point.
"Each year we've added a few
things, we've maybe deleted a few
things, tweaked a few things to fit
what we think our needs are," An
derson explains. "But overall, it's
stayed very similar... There are
not a lot of changes. If anything,
we're trying to maybe simplify
things a little bit so we don't have as
many levels of checks and adjust
ments, so that once we make a de
fensive call we can go out there and
play fast, get lined up and execute
the ca11... We want to be as funda
mentally sound as we possibly can."
"He pretty much knows what he
wants to d 0... We speak the same
language," Fangio says approvingly
when asked about Anderson. "He's
got a good knowledge of front play
and pressuring the quarterback, un
derstanding how you have to play
the coverage behind it... He'd like to
have a good mix of pressure and
strength defenses, and be able to in
terchange in and out of the emphasis
week to week by the opponent
they're playing.
"I think he brought to the prac
tice field an intensity and work ethic
that was contagious to the players,
that they respected and that he was
consistent with."
Anderson, for his part, is philo
sophical about his new position.
"Yes, we've had changes, head
coaching changes, other changes on
staff, but really those three going on
four years now, it's just the coaching
staff and the chemistry and the
bond, and everybody being on the
same page. It's just been remark
able. And I think that's one reason
too [for] all the success we've had.
It's been good coaches who know
what they're doing and guys that get
along well together. It's been fun."

In 2006, the last year before Lance Anderson (center) arrived, the Cardinal's
defense recorded a measly 14 sacks. Then in 2007, with Anderson
on the staff, Stanford racked up 37 sacks, ranking it among the top
20 in the nation in that category. Over the past two years, the Cardinal
finished first in the nation in sacks, including a 57-sackyear in 201 2 with
Chase Thomas (right) and Trent Murphy (left) manning the outside linebacker
positions en route to a victory in the Rose Bowl Game.
