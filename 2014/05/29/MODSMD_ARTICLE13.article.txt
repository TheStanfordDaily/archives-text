### WINSTON SHI MANAGING EDITOR 
This is the second piece of a
three-part feature running this
week on Lance Anderson,
Stanford football's defensive
coordinator and ace recruiter,
now entering his eighth season
with Stanford football Part I
focused on Anderson's reshap
ing of Stanford's recruiting ap
paratus. Part II covers Ander
son's coaching and leadership
of the Cardinal defense. Tomor
row, Part 111 will cover Ander
son's life as a college coach.

Lance Anderson is a cor
nerstone of the reinvent
ed Stanford football pro
gram, a team enjoying
sustained success for the
first time since Pop Warner
roamed the sidelines. But while
Stanford football carries with it a
strong sense of newness, the na
ture of a cornerstone is that it does
not change.
In recruiting and redefining the
program, Anderson has been an
agent of change. But now that
Stanford has become more and

more successful, Anderson has
found himself charged with main
taining continuity on one of college
football's finest defenses, as well as
mentoring players across the ros
ter. While Anderson will naturally
have to adapt as the circumstances
surrounding Stanford inevitably
change, the task is now to maintain
the well-oiled machine that is the
Stanford defense and, hopeful
ly, to help push the team as a whole
to even greater glory.

Anderson may be focusing more
on his coaching role than on re
cruiting these days, but what does
that mean? Coaching isn't just call
ing plays from the press box during
games or running drills during
practice; a coach has to keep an eye
on every facet of his players' well
being. And while recruiting is a
huge part of a team's success,
coaching is a critical part of what
makes success possible.
When Anderson arrived on
Stanford's campus, it was clear that
there were a lot of things that had
to be fixed in order to repair the
program most importantly,
making sure that players were able
to play and in the right mind to play
in the first place.
Injuries were the first thing.
"We just realized that you can

have many good football players,
but if they're not able to practice
if they're not healthy it's hard to
have a good football team," Ander
son explains. "You can't get better
as a football player unless you're on
the field practicing, unless you're
on the field playing, and Shannon
[Turley, Stanford's director of
sports performance] has done a
great job with his program here of
not only developing guys physical
ly, helping them to get bigger,
faster, stronger, to become better
football players ... they've also
stayed healthy."
Better yet, that injury protec
tion extended not only to Stan
ford's oft-injured stars but the en
tire Cardinal roster, allowing Stan
ford's newer players to keep on de
veloping. From 2006 to 2012, Tur
ley helped cut the number of
games missed to injury among
Stanford's entire two-deep by a
staggering 87 percent.
Yet and Turley would agree
cutting injuries was not a cure
all to Stanford's problems. The is
sues were far more endemic and
systemic than that.
Managing the team's psycholo
gy both on and off the field was a
key component of Stanford's suc
cess. The importance of player re
locations is well known in profes

sional soccer, where high-priced
acquisitions often fail because of
culture shock, but it's perhaps less
important for most college football
teams, which play in a sport that is
still rather regional.
That doesn't hold for Stanford:
The Cardinal are the most national
team in the country, and it isn't
close. Since Anderson arrived on
campus, Stanford has drawn re
cruits from 33 different states. Its
players travel further to get to
campus than players at any other
program in the country; aside from
crunching the numbers on recruit
ing, statistician Dave Bartoo also
found that the average player on
the 2014 roster traveled over 1,400
miles in order to get to campus.
When Stanford players return
home for Christmas, the sum total
of their round-trip journeys is al
most 300,000 miles. That's farther
than the distance from the Earth
to the Moon.
With statistics like these, one
couldn't be faulted for wondering
how Stanford's program exists at
all. College football is a regional
sport for a reason; home cooking
has a statistically significant effect,
and going to a school across the
country typically cuts a recruit's

coordinators Vic Fangio and Derek Mason. Anderson, a recruiting extraordinaire, will look to emulate their prior success in his new role.
