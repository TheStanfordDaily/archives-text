# ROWING Q&A
## A 						LOOK AHEAD TO THE NCAAs 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
On the heels of Stanford women's rowing's
first Pac-12 conference championship, The
Daily's Ashley Westhem talked with sopho
more varsity eight rower Katie Toothman
in advance of the 201f NCAA Champi
onship this weekend.
Ashley Westhem (AW): What does winning the
Pac-12 title for the first time in program history
mean to you and the team?
Katie Toothman (KT): Our team morale is real
ly high right now and it hasn't been for a while.
Last year we got fifth at Pac-12s and that was a
disappointment, so this year has been really excit
ing. I don't think anyone realized how good we
could be and so winning Pac-12s just showed us
how much our new training plan and the hard

work that we put in together works. And since
we've won the Big Row and Pac-12s we're more
excited to row and to erg and just making it all
worth it. So these past few weeks have been real
ly rewarding.
AW: How does having the No. 2 overall seed affect
the team's mindset heading into Friday?
KT: For me, I'm just saying that rankings don't
matter because anything can happen. So they
seed each of these boats in the finals so that if you
finish faster you get the middle lane, and then
they seed out from there. So last year at the
NCAAs, Cal was in sixth, which means they
were slated to lose, and they won by seconds in
the last 500 [meters]. They just shot through and
above everyone else. I think USC was ranked
first and they got really cocky. I think our team
has been really good about realizing that we
have a lot of work to do and have a lot of potential,

which everyone is excited about.
AW: Yale did not qualify this year for NCAAs,
which hardly ever happens. What is the new
qualifying system for NCAAs that kept them out
of it?
KT: They changed the system to qualify for
NCAAs recently so that each conference has an
automatic bid, so if you win the team trophy or for
the Ivy League if your varsity eight wins, you get
an automatic bid. Besides that, there are at-large
bids. The Pac-12 is the most competitive confer
ence along with the Ivy League. And I don't know
if it's unfair that Yale didn't get invited, but there
was one race at the Ivies in particular where
their 2V and four did fine, but their Y8 got last
and lost to Dartmouth by six seconds. So it was
probably that race [that kept them out]. But they

No. 2 Stanford women's rowing (above) will look to build upon its successful season as it heads to Indianapolis for the NCAA Championships.
The Cardinal won their first ever Pac- 12 championship this season and beat Cal twice in one of its best seasons in the program's history.
don't deserve to be left out. It
is an embarrassment for
them, and what's awful is that
because there are these auto
matic bids for conferences,
for instance [teams] like Jack
sonville [qualified]. But in the
long run, this new automatic
bid system will make it so that
all of the conferences are
more equal, because they all
get to go to NCAAs. They'll
get more recruits and more
money and it will attract more
people who are faster.
AW: You are going to be in In
dianapolis for a week before
competition starts. What will
the week look like?
KT: We train at the Universi
ty of Miami in Ohio in this
state park called Houston
Woods; we're kind of hidden
on purpose. So we'll train
there for a week and then
we're two hours from Indi
anapolis so we'll have prac
tices on the course, but we'll

be tapering so it's going to be
really short practices. We'll
iron things out and see the
other teams.

AW: What's been the high
light of the season?

KT: I honestly think beating
Cal. Last year I was in the 2V
for the race, and we were
seeded pretty badly and we
weren't supposed to win.
When we passed under the
bridge, we were winning by
open water, and then coming
out of the bridge we were los
ing by open water. So this
year, we were hungry to win
and had something to prove.
Cal was undefeated, ranked
No. 2 and I know a lot of girls
in their boat. They would
just write Stanford off and I
think now we've shown them
twice that they can't do that,
and I think they're having a
pretty bad hell week train
ing wise. I'd say winning the
Big Row in all three boats
just proved that we are fast
enough and I couldn't have
imagined anything better.
