# PROMISING FUTURE
## Freshman trio set to become leaders 
### FIONA NOONAN STAFF WRITER 
Although the trophy count for
the No. 11-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team (20-3, 8-2
Pac-12) remains the same after
this season, the school's most deco
rated team is looking good for the
future after a year of solid per
formances, dramatic upsets and
the arrival of a stellar freshman
lineup.
Expectations were high for
2014 after the Cardinal captured
the singles and team titles at the
NCAA Tournament last year, and

the squad was up to the task.
After losing two-time NCAA
singles champion and 2012 NCAA
doubles champion Nicole Gibbs to
the professional tour before her
senior year, Stanford had a gaping
hole to fill in its lineup. Enter Tay
lor Davidson, Caroline Doyle and
Carol Zhao, the trio of freshmen
that came in as the top-ranked re
cruiting class in the country, and
quickly proved why they deserved
to play for one of the nation's most
legendary tennis programs.
The storyline of the year was,
without a doubt, these three young
stars, who made up half of head
coach Lele Forood's starting line
up and together accumulated a 90-
21 record on the year.
"We sort of formed [a] little
freshman group," Zhao said. "It's

really fun to watch us grow kind of
like a mini team, because we're all
new to this, and [there have been] a
lot of first experiences for us."
For the first part of the season,
the experiences were typical of
Stanford tennis. The Cardinal
began the year ranked at No. 1 in
January, and did not lose a match
until April 4. In fact, the squad was
so dominant that when it fell to
UCLA (the eventual NCAA cham
pion), Stanford had been the only
team in the country without a loss
on its record.
A huge part of that success
came from the three freshmen, but
also from the returning veterans in
sophomore Krista Hardebeck, jun
ior Ellen Tsay and senior Kristie
