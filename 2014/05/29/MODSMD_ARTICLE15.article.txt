# PROMISING FUTURE
## Freshman trio set to become leaders 
### FIONA NOONAN STAFF WRITER 
Although the trophy count for
the No. 11-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team (20-3, 8-2
Pac-12) remains the same after
this season, the school's most deco
rated team is looking good for the
future after a year of solid per
formances, dramatic upsets and
the arrival of a stellar freshman
lineup.
Expectations were high for
2014 after the Cardinal captured
the singles and team titles at the
NCAA Tournament last year, and

the squad was up to the task.
After losing two-time NCAA
singles champion and 2012 NCAA
doubles champion Nicole Gibbs to
the professional tour before her
senior year, Stanford had a gaping
hole to fill in its lineup. Enter Tay
lor Davidson, Caroline Doyle and
Carol Zhao, the trio of freshmen
that came in as the top-ranked re
cruiting class in the country, and
quickly proved why they deserved
to play for one of the nation's most
legendary tennis programs.
The storyline of the year was,
without a doubt, these three young
stars, who made up half of head
coach Lele Forood's starting line
up and together accumulated a 90-
21 record on the year.
"We sort of formed [a] little
freshman group," Zhao said. "It's

really fun to watch us grow kind of
like a mini team, because we're all
new to this, and [there have been] a
lot of first experiences for us."
For the first part of the season,
the experiences were typical of
Stanford tennis. The Cardinal
began the year ranked at No. 1 in
January, and did not lose a match
until April 4. In fact, the squad was
so dominant that when it fell to
UCLA (the eventual NCAA cham
pion), Stanford had been the only
team in the country without a loss
on its record.
A huge part of that success
came from the three freshmen, but
also from the returning veterans in
sophomore Krista Hardebeck, jun
ior Ellen Tsay and senior Kristie

Freshman Carol Zhao (above) helped fill the shoes of Nicole Gibbs this season, as she joined senior Kristie
Ahn on the Cardinal's top doubles pairing and also climbed into the national top 25 singles rankings.
Ahn. Ahn, a senior in her last
year before going pro, was
especially crucial throughout
the season. She consistently
held down the number one
spot in Stanford's lineup, and
also spent the majority of the
season among the top five
ranked players nationally.
Tsay and Hardebeck, who
both played critical roles in
last year's NCAA success,
also made huge contributions
on courts five and two, re
spectively, adding to the
team's collective flawless
ness. Over the course of the
year, the Cardinal blanked
opponents in 13 matches and
had their entire lineup
ranked in the top 40 at one
point, demonstrating the
depth and potency of their
roster.
With the small exception
of the close loss to UCLA,
Stanford's dominance con
tinued right up until Senior
Day, the final match of the
regular season, which also
happened to be the Big Slam
against Cal.
Then, for the first time all
year, the Cardinal experi
enced a bad loss, falling 6-1 to
their Pac-12 foe, and thus, en
tered the postseason on a low
note.
The disappointment par
tially carried over to the Pac
-12 individual tournament,
where the main draw didn't
result in any stellar Cardinal
performances. The duo of
Ahn and Zhao took second
place on the doubles side, but
the team still went into the
NCAAs clearly desiring im
provement.
After entering the
NCAAs as the No. 12 seed
last year, it felt like deja vu
when the Cardinal entered
the tournament at No. 11, but
this time without Gibbs to
head up the roster.

"We were very insulted
that they would seed us that
low again, especially after
what happened the year be
fore," Davidson said. "It mo
tivated us in a positive way...
because in our mind, we were
the number one seed and we
could win the whole thing."
From then on, they cer
tainly played that way, rip
ping through the first two
rounds at home and on
through to the round of 16 in
Athens, Georgia.
Then came the defining
moment of the season: a re
match against Cal in the
round of 16. The Cardinal
were back in regular form
against the Bears, fighting
tooth and nail to keep their
repeat hopes alive.
The match could hardly
have been more dramatic,
with Stanford down 3-2 as
Davidson fought off cramps
and Doyle fought off match
points. Once Davidson pulled
off a major victory against
NCAA singles runner-up
Lynn Chi, it came down to
Doyle.
"I had my team scream
ing their heads off for me,
and I just knew I had to real
ly dig deep for my team,"
Doyle said. "[lf] I was going
to go down, I was going to go
down with everything I had."
Luckily for the Cardinal,
it went the other way, and a
Stanford repeat looked pos
sible.
Unfortunately for them,
however, the run stopped
short in a heartbreaking 4-3
decision against perennial
powerhouse North Carolina.
Ahn played the deciding
match, a tough way for the
superstar senior to end her
career at Stanford.
The team rallied for the
individual side of the N CAAs
just days later, where it was
the only school to have all six
members of the starting line
up entered in the bracket. Ul
timately, only Ahn and Zhao
made it past the round of 32,
but their seasons ended for

both doubles and singles in
the round of 16 the following
day.
That said, the bright
spots from the season are
countless.
Ahn finally overcame a
career riddled with injury to
take her place as the team's
number one player, where
she fulfilled her role brilliant
ly and ended the season
ranked No. 3 in the country.
This week, she was rewarded
with first team All-Pac-12
honors, All-America honors
and the ITA National Senior
Player of the Year award.
Zhao also earned second
team All-Pac-12 awards,
while Davidson and Harde
beck got honorable mention
nods.
As the Gibbs-Ahn era
comes to a close, Stanford
tennis has nothing to fear.
The team won't be getting
any recruits next year, but
the young team will get to
continue building as the cur
rent freshmen take on more
leadership.
"I feel like we're veterans
going into next year, almost,"
Zhao said. "Because our
team is going to be even
smaller next year, I feel like
we have to take ownership of
the team and be responsible
for everything going for
ward."
Given this year's per
formance, that should be no
problem for the three capa
ble women.
"We still have room to
grow. We have three more
years, so we'll see what hap
pens," Doyle said.
Whatever lies ahead,
Stanford can rest assured
that its women's tennis team
isn't fading anytime soon if
Davidson, Doyle, and Zhao
have anything to say about it.
"Going through all this to
gether is just making us
stronger," Davidson said.
"There are no limits."
