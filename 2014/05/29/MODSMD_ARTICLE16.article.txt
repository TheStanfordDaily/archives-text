# BACK AND FORTH
## THAWING THE PENGUINS 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
In advance of Stanford base
ball's upcoming NCAA Re
gional in Bloomington, Indi
ana, The Daily's Michael Pe
terson chatted with Steve Wilaj,
a sports editor at The Jambar,
to get perspective on the
Youngstown State Penguins,
one of the Cardinal's three op
ponents this weekend.

Michael Peterson (MP): One of

the most striking things when
first examining this has to be ,
Youngstown State (YSU) and
its record so far this season. \

At 16-36, most people would
n't expect YSU to win its
conference tournament and \
make the NCAA Tourna-

ment. How did it pull off the
incredible feat of making
the tournament despite a (>
poor regular season? Is

its record misleading?
Steve Wilaj(SW): It
was completely stun
ning that YSU swept i

through the Horizon â– 
League tournament
like it did, especially
after the Penguins lost
eight of 10 to close the reg-

ular season.
At 16-36, the record '
isn't too misleading. Like

most mid-majors, YSU's record
took a hit from a rough out-of-con
ference schedule, but the Penguins
were still only 6-17 in the Horizon
for the regular season. A hint that
they had the ability to pull off this
feat is that they beat fellow NCAA
Tournament qualifiers Kent State
twice.
The key in the Horizon League
tourney was the starting pitching,
which was YSU's weak spot all sea
son. The Penguins' starting staff
recorded four quality starts in a row
before turning the games over to the
team's strong point, its bullpen.
Most surprisingly, walk-on fresh
man Jeremy Quinlan threw a com
plete game while allowing just one
run against top seed Wright State to
pick up his first career win. Also,
senior second baseman Phil Lipari
got extremely hot, as he went 11-
for-21 at the plate to earn tourna
ment MVP

MP: ESPN recently published
an article about the tournament that
examined each of the regionals. In
its analysis, ESPN dubbed the Indi

ana-Youngstown State matchup in
the Bloomington Regional as "a glo
rified scrimmage." Given its recent
success, how much of a chance do
you think YSU has to knock off the
tournament's No. 4 overall seed in
its first game?
SW: The glorified scrimmage tag
is probably pretty accurate. Even
though YSU got hot, you have to re
member that the Penguins are 16-36
for a reason and Indiana is really
good. Plus, YSU is sending Jared
Wight who has an ERA around 7
to the mound. So it may get ugly
pretty quick. I'd give YSU a very
slim chance.

MP: You mentioned earli
er that YSU's bullpen
might be the strength of
the team. Since a team

could potentially play five
games in four days, the
bullpen will likely carry a
heavy burden and have

to pitch a lot of innings.

Could the prowess of
the bullpen be
i enough to get YSU a

i win this weekend?
SW: Possibly. If
I YSU can turn the
game over to the
bullpen with a lead at
least after four or
five innings a
formula that

worked a couple times in
tne ML/ tournament that may be
its best shot. Head coach Steve
Gillispie has three or four guys he
really likes in the pen (particularly
Alex Frey and closer Kevin Yara
binec) and isn't afraid to use them
early. Another key for the Penguins
will be to score early and play with a
lead which they've been able to
do recently considering they
don't have a very dynamic offense.

MP: In spite of its poor record,
do you think that the difficult non
conference schedule and the success
in the Horizon League tournament,
a format very similar to this week
end's regional, has prepared the
team for the difficulty of playing in
an NCAA Regional? How much mo
mentum do you expect to carry over
from the outstanding performances
in the HL tournament?
SW: The difficult matchups, like
at North Carolina State and at
Cincinnati early in the season,
should help as far as experience and
having played on the big stage al-

ready. Coach Gillispie is hop
ing it takes away some of the
nerves.
While I'm sure YSU is
aware of the stiff test it's up
against in Indiana, as well as
the other two potential oppo
nents, the Penguins can't
help but to be full of confi
dence right now. Not only did
they sweep the Horizon

League tourney, but they
pretty much dominated it.
While it's hard to say how
much momentum espe
cially hot hitting will
carry over after a week's
break, the Penguins certain
ly aren't hurting for confi
dence at this point. And a
confident team is a danger
ous team.
MP: What is your predic
tion for the Penguins this
weekend throughout the Re
gional?
SW: It's going to be tough

for YSU to get a win in
Bloomington this weekend.
A lot would have to go right.
I'll say the Penguins will lose
to Indiana handily and they'll
also fall in their second game.
But that's nothing to hang
their heads about. It is still a
remarkable accomplishment
for YSU to reach the NCAA
Tournament after such a dis
mal regular season, and it's a
great building block for the
future.
