# Cardinal by the numbers
## Breaking down some Stanford baseball stats 
### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
After a disappointing 2013 campaign in
which Stanford's baseball team fell short of
the postseason for just the fifth time in head
coach Mark Marquess's 34 seasons at the
helm, the Cardinal are back in the NCAA
tournament, as they enter the Bloomington,
Indiana regional this weekend on a hot streak,
looking to make a deep run. Here's a look at
key numbers that tell the story of how the
team got to this point.
19-7 : The Cardinal's record since April
12, after they went 11-16 to begin the
season.
Coming out of the gate, Stanford start
ed its season off slowly against one of the
toughest non-conference slates in the
country. The team began with three week
end series against teams in the top 12 in
RPI home against Rice (7 in RPI), at
Texas (12), at Vanderbilt (8) and fol
lowed that up with a home series against
Kansas (47). Marquess sent out a freshman
to start Opening Day for the first time
since Mike Mussina got the nod in 1988,
and would go on to send out freshmen to
start the team's first 27 games.
But while the freshmen pitchers sur
prisingly held their own in their first two
and a half months playing collegiate base
ball, the Cardinal offense struggled early.
Runners would reach base and move into
scoring position early in innings, but they
were often stranded by a lack of timely hit
ting. Before April 12, Stanford hit just .246
and owned a .330 on-base percentage. But
the team turned it around after that, as it
closed out the season hitting .292 with a
.364 on-base percentage in its final 26
games. That offensive surge was a major
force behind the Cardinal's postseason
push.

.455: Junior Austin Slater's batting av
erage over his career-long 17-game hit

ting streak, the ninth-longest Stanford
streak since 1988.
Slater has been one of the major reasons
behind the Cardinal's offensive turnaround in
the second half of the season. Though his bat
ting average did hover around .300 for the
majority of the season, the center fielder
from Jacksonville, Florida has reached a new
level over his last 17 games. Slater has scored
14 runs over that span and has also become
one of the Cardinal's most efficient and reli
able run producers. During the hitting
streak, he has driven in 15 runs, taking ad
vantage of being regularly slotted in the
cleanup spot since the Arizona series at the
beginning of May. With runners in scoring
position, he's been incredibly effective since
the beginning of the season, tallying 16 RBIs
in 17 opportunities with a runner at third and
less than two outs.
Protected by sophomore right fielder Zach
Hoffpauir in the five hole, who himself is hit
ting .520 with three homers and 13 RBIs over
his last 13 games, Slater is sure to do some

damage in the heart of Stanford's lineup this
weekend.

66: The number of sacrifice bunts exe
cuted by the offense this season, ranked
20th nationally.
Despite the Cardinal's increased offensive
production of late, a constant in Marquess's
strategy has been using small ball to push
across runs, something fans are sure to see
against tougher competition in the regional.
While at times this approach has led to pre
cious outs being wasted, Stanford often takes
advantage of sacrifices to get out to early
leads. The strategy has proven to be an effec
tive one, as the team owns a 21-5 record when
scoring first this season.
Senior Brett Michael Doran has accounted
for a third of the team's sacrifice bunts, as his
22 set a Stanford single-season record and
rank second in the nation this season behind
Washington's Andrew Ely. No other player on
the Cardinal roster has more than 10 sacrifice
bunts.

2.88: The combined ERA of the Cardi
nal's starting rotation of freshman Cal
Quantrill, junior John Hochstatter and
sophomore Logan James over the last
four weekend series.
Stanford's current starting rotation was
really only set a month ago, before the team's
series against UCLA in Westwood. When
Hochstatter took over freshman Chris Viall's
spot in the weekend rotation on April 13 in
Washington, and James took over freshman
Brett Hanewich's weekend spot after a strong
first mid-week start against Pacific on April
29, there weren't many expectations for the
pitchers who had up until that point in the sea
son been coming out of the bullpen. Hochstat
ter had experience starting behind Mark
Appel 'l3 in his freshman and sophomore
years, but James had only made three career
starts prior to this season.
But the rotation came together and be
came the glue that held the team together

Junior Austin Slater (above) has assembled a 17-game hitting streak to close out the regular season, hitting .455 over that four-week span.
His production has sparked the Cardinal's offense, which underperformed early in the season, to hit .292 over its final 26 games.
during the stretch run. Over
those last four weekend se
ries, the trio went a com
bined 8-2 with a 2.88 ERA, a
1.10 WHIP and a 6.3 K/9 rate
over 12 starts. More impor
tantly, heading into a
marathon tournament
where the Cardinal may play
five games in four days this
weekend, the starters aver
aged seven innings per start
over that span. Going deep
into ballgames will be crucial
in the postseason in order to
save the bullpen for key situ
ations.

.9763: Stanford's regu
lar season fielding percent
age, which ranked 14th na
tionally and just .001 be
hind the school record of
.9773 set in 2005.
The Cardinal's defensive
prowess has slipped under
the radar this season, but
their performance was un
doubtedly historic. While the
Stanford pitching staff cer
tainly pitched to contact this
season, as their 314 regular
season strikeouts are the
team's fewest dating back to
at least the 2000 season, the
defense proved ready to han
dle the increased workload.
The Cardinal committed just
50 errors over their 53 regu
lar season games, and tallied
24 errorless ballgames in
which they owned a 15-9
record.

Stanford, seeded third in
its regional, will begin the
NCAA Tournament on Fri
day at 11 a.m. at Bart Kauf
man Field against Indiana
State. The game will be tele
vised on ESPN3.

Stanford's current starting rotation was

series against UCLA in Westwood. When
Hochstatter took over freshman Chris Viall's
spot in the weekend rotation on April 13 in
Washington, and James took over freshman
Brett Hanewich's weekend spot after a strong
first mid-week start against Pacific on April
29, there weren't many expectations for the
pitchers who had up until that point in the sea

Appel 'l3 in his freshman and sophomore
years, but James had only made three career
starts prior to this season.

Junior Austin Slater (above) has assembled a 17-game hitting streak to close out the regular season, hitting .455 over that four-week span.
His production has sparked the Cardinal's offense, which underperformed early in the season, to hit .292 over its final 26 games.

their performance was un

After a disappointing 2013 campaign in
which Stanford's baseball team fell short of
the postseason for just the fifth time in head
coach Mark Marquess's 34 seasons at the
helm, the Cardinal are back in the NCAA
tournament, as they enter the Bloomington,
Indiana regional this weekend on a hot streak,
looking to make a deep run. Here's a look at
key numbers that tell the story of how the
team got to this point.
19-7 : The Cardinal's record since April
12, after they went 11-16 to begin the
season.
Coming out of the gate, Stanford start
ed its season off slowly against one of the
toughest non-conference slates in the
country. The team began with three week
end series against teams in the top 12 in
RPI home against Rice (7 in RPI), at
Texas (12), at Vanderbilt (8) and fol
lowed that up with a home series against
Kansas (47). Marquess sent out a freshman
to start Opening Day for the first time
since Mike Mussina got the nod in 1988,
and would go on to send out freshmen to
start the team's first 27 games.
But while the freshmen pitchers sur
prisingly held their own in their first two
and a half months playing collegiate base
ball, the Cardinal offense struggled early.
Runners would reach base and move into
scoring position early in innings, but they
were often stranded by a lack of timely hit
ting. Before April 12, Stanford hit just .246
and owned a .330 on-base percentage. But
the team turned it around after that, as it
closed out the season hitting .292 with a
.364 on-base percentage in its final 26
games. That offensive surge was a major
force behind the Cardinal's postseason
push.

.455: Junior Austin Slater's batting av
erage over his career-long 17-game hit

ting streak, the ninth-longest Stanford
streak since 1988.
Slater has been one of the major reasons
behind the Cardinal's offensive turnaround in
the second half of the season. Though his bat
ting average did hover around .300 for the
majority of the season, the center fielder
from Jacksonville, Florida has reached a new
level over his last 17 games. Slater has scored
14 runs over that span and has also become
one of the Cardinal's most efficient and reli
able run producers. During the hitting
streak, he has driven in 15 runs, taking ad
vantage of being regularly slotted in the
cleanup spot since the Arizona series at the
beginning of May. With runners in scoring
position, he's been incredibly effective since
the beginning of the season, tallying 16 RBIs
in 17 opportunities with a runner at third and
less than two outs.
Protected by sophomore right fielder Zach
Hoffpauir in the five hole, who himself is hit
ting .520 with three homers and 13 RBIs over
his last 13 games, Slater is sure to do some

damage in the heart of Stanford's lineup this
weekend.

66: The number of sacrifice bunts exe
cuted by the offense this season, ranked
20th nationally.
Despite the Cardinal's increased offensive
production of late, a constant in Marquess's
strategy has been using small ball to push
across runs, something fans are sure to see
against tougher competition in the regional.
While at times this approach has led to pre
cious outs being wasted, Stanford often takes
advantage of sacrifices to get out to early
leads. The strategy has proven to be an effec
tive one, as the team owns a 21-5 record when
scoring first this season.
Senior Brett Michael Doran has accounted
for a third of the team's sacrifice bunts, as his
22 set a Stanford single-season record and
rank second in the nation this season behind
Washington's Andrew Ely. No other player on
the Cardinal roster has more than 10 sacrifice
bunts.

2.88: The combined ERA of the Cardi
nal's starting rotation of freshman Cal
Quantrill, junior John Hochstatter and
sophomore Logan James over the last
four weekend series.
