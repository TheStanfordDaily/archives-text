### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
The passing of renowned writer
Maya Angelou sparked discussion
and remembrance across campus
Wednesday.
On the Diaspora mailing list, the
self-described "virtual soul of the
Black Community at Stanford," an
email thread developed in which stu
dents and faculty shared thoughts
about and quotes from Angelou's
work.
"Maya Angelou was a symbol of
empowerment for black women and
truly celebrated our inner spirit
through her eloquent words," wrote
one post. "No one could explain it
quite like she could."
Angelou was a memoirist and
poet best known for her autobiogra
phy "I Know Why the Caged Bird
Sings," which was published in 1969.
The book recounted Angelou's child
hood growing up in Arkansas.
Angela Farr Schiller, a Ph.D. can
didate in the department of theater
and performance studies, noted the
significance of a woman of color writ
ing about her personal experiences in
the Jim Crow South.
"It says that I have something to
say that is of value and I'm going to be
responsible for telling the story,"
Schiller said. "That she writes in that
genre [of autobiography], as well as
many other genres, is important for
any kind of people, but especially
groups that are marginalized or
framed as not important in the
world."

Angelou at Stanford
During her life, Angelou spoke at
Stanford on several different occa
sions.
On February 7,1972, three years
after her book came out, Angelou
gave a talk titled "Black American
Contributions to the American Way
of Life" at Memorial Auditorium.
'Angelou kept the diverse audi
ence spellbound," The Daily wrote at
the time. "Her deep commanding
voice made several points, illustrat
ing some with her poetry, which
largely reflects the black experience
of the event."
Angelou returned to Memorial
Auditorium as part of the 1997 Black
Liberation Month celebration and
addressed an audience of more than
2,000 people at a Palo Alto theater in
