# Outdoor theme house proposed
## Students feel need for new niche in community 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
To address a perceived need for an outdoor
and recreational community at Stanford, under
graduate students have raised the idea of creat
ing an outdoors-themed house, evaluating the
student body's interest in such a community and
taking the initial steps to propose such a theme to
Residential Education.
"It would be an outdoor action sports theme,"
said Natasha Berk 'l6, one of the students head
ing the initiative. "It'd be for people who like to
go out and do fun stuff outdoors hiking, climb
ing, backpacking, mountaineering, all that kind
of stuff but also have a fun community to live
with. And you don't have to be an intense hiker or
an expert skier or anything."
Berk estimates that up to 200 students are in
terested in such a community.
"Twenty people are actually actively working
on it," Berk said. "But I've also had a lot of peo
ple email saying that they were interested.
There's a small number of people that are inter
ested in helping out with the actual paperwork,
but what I think is more important is that there's
a larger community of people that would be in
terested in living in the house."
The outdoor interest group hopes to host the
new community in a house as opposed to in a
dorm, as this would provide more space to store
equipment and would better foster outdoor ac
tivities.
"We think a house would be really important
to building the lasting community that we're en
visioning," Berk said. "All the [existing] houses
have unique personalities and they are very well
associated with the community the house repre
sents. We would want gear storage, and since
we're outdoor themed, it would be awesome if we
could have a garden."
The initiative to pull together an outdoor com
munity is not only headed by students, but also
