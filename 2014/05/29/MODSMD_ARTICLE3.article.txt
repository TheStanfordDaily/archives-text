# Outdoor theme house proposed
## Students feel need for new niche in community 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
To address a perceived need for an outdoor
and recreational community at Stanford, under
graduate students have raised the idea of creat
ing an outdoors-themed house, evaluating the
student body's interest in such a community and
taking the initial steps to propose such a theme to
Residential Education.
"It would be an outdoor action sports theme,"
said Natasha Berk 'l6, one of the students head
ing the initiative. "It'd be for people who like to
go out and do fun stuff outdoors hiking, climb
ing, backpacking, mountaineering, all that kind
of stuff but also have a fun community to live
with. And you don't have to be an intense hiker or
an expert skier or anything."
Berk estimates that up to 200 students are in
terested in such a community.
"Twenty people are actually actively working
on it," Berk said. "But I've also had a lot of peo
ple email saying that they were interested.
There's a small number of people that are inter
ested in helping out with the actual paperwork,
but what I think is more important is that there's
a larger community of people that would be in
terested in living in the house."
The outdoor interest group hopes to host the
new community in a house as opposed to in a
dorm, as this would provide more space to store
equipment and would better foster outdoor ac
tivities.
"We think a house would be really important
to building the lasting community that we're en
visioning," Berk said. "All the [existing] houses
have unique personalities and they are very well
associated with the community the house repre
sents. We would want gear storage, and since
we're outdoor themed, it would be awesome if we
could have a garden."
The initiative to pull together an outdoor com
munity is not only headed by students, but also

backed by support from
Stanford Outdoor Educa
tion, specifically from associ
ate director Christopher
Pelchat.
"I've worked at Eastern
Washington University and
Ithaca College before com
ing to Stanford, and both of
those campuses had outdoor
communities," Pelchat said.
"I was surprised that there
was [an outdoor educational]
program of this size here
and we didn't have [an out
door community] in our resi
dential education."
The themed house plans
to collaborate heavily with
Stanford Outdoor Educa
tion, which can provide
recreational equipment and
training protocols for the
various outdoor activities.
"If they have folks in the

house that want to be
trained, they can run those
programs specifically for
their house," Pelchat said.
"There's also general pro
gramming [from Outdoor
Education] that they can
add to their house activities
and funding opportunities if
they want to bring a speaker
or need space to host them."
Currently, the students
are working on the proposal
for the themed house and
are meeting on a regular
basis, as well as brainstorm
ing ideas for the standards
of the proposed house.
These standards would in
clude how responsibilities
would be managed in the
house, as well as specific
learning outcomes that are
associated with the outdoor
education focus of the com
munity.
Zach Chase 'l6, another
student actively working on
the proposal, is collecting
student feedback from cur
rent themed houses in order

to help shape these require
ments.
"It's a good idea to go out
and talk to people in the
houses and ask them what
they like about their houses,"
Chase said. "For example,
one question we have is what
the requirements for living in
an outdoor theme house
should be... feedback would
be helpful in informing some
of our decisions."
The students hope to put
together a solid proposal
during the next academic
year, hoping to unfold their
themed house in fall quarter
of 2015.
"This is much more about
making a fun living commu
nity with a tight-knit commu
nity," Berk said. "It's not so
academic. It's just about
doing fun things in the out
doors. A lot of people feel like
it's a niche on campus that
needs to be filled."

There's a small number of people that are inter
ested in helping out with the actual paperwork,
but what I think is more important is that there's
a larger community of people that would be in
terested in living in the house."
The outdoor interest group hopes to host the
new community in a house as opposed to in a
dorm, as this would provide more space to store
equipment and would better foster outdoor ac
tivities.
"We think a house would be really important
to building the lasting community that we're en
visioning," Berk said. "All the [existing] houses
have unique personalities and they are very well
associated with the community the house repre
sents. We would want gear storage, and since
we're outdoor themed, it would be awesome if we
could have a garden."
The initiative to pull together an outdoor com
munity is not only headed by students, but also

Perceiving a lack of community for recreational sports, undergraduate students have begun the
process to propose their idea of creating an outdoors-themed house to Residential Education.
backed by support from
Stanford Outdoor Educa
tion, specifically from associ
ate director Christopher
Pelchat.
"I've worked at Eastern
Washington University and
Ithaca College before com
ing to Stanford, and both of
those campuses had outdoor
communities," Pelchat said.
"I was surprised that there
was [an outdoor educational]
program of this size here
and we didn't have [an out
door community] in our resi
dential education."
The themed house plans
to collaborate heavily with
Stanford Outdoor Educa
tion, which can provide
recreational equipment and
training protocols for the
various outdoor activities.
"If they have folks in the

house that want to be
trained, they can run those
programs specifically for
their house," Pelchat said.
"There's also general pro
gramming [from Outdoor
Education] that they can
add to their house activities
and funding opportunities if
they want to bring a speaker
or need space to host them."
Currently, the students
are working on the proposal
for the themed house and
are meeting on a regular
basis, as well as brainstorm
ing ideas for the standards
of the proposed house.
These standards would in
clude how responsibilities
would be managed in the
house, as well as specific
learning outcomes that are
associated with the outdoor
education focus of the com
munity.
Zach Chase 'l6, another
student actively working on
the proposal, is collecting
student feedback from cur
rent themed houses in order

to help shape these require
ments.
"It's a good idea to go out
and talk to people in the
houses and ask them what
they like about their houses,"
Chase said. "For example,
one question we have is what
the requirements for living in
an outdoor theme house
should be... feedback would
be helpful in informing some
of our decisions."
The students hope to put
together a solid proposal
during the next academic
year, hoping to unfold their
themed house in fall quarter
of 2015.
"This is much more about
making a fun living commu
nity with a tight-knit commu
nity," Berk said. "It's not so
academic. It's just about
doing fun things in the out
doors. A lot of people feel like
it's a niche on campus that
needs to be filled."
