## Decathlon home relocates to Jasper Ridge 
### MADELEINE HAN DESK EDITOR 
Start.Home, Stanford Solar Decathlon's
most recent project, recently received county
approval to serve as a residence for the Jasper
Ridge Biological Preserve park ranger and his
family.
Start.Home is the team's student-de
signed and student-built entry into the 2013
U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon.
The home, which is now located at Jasper
Ridge, features net-zero energy use and sus

tainable materials.

In the early stages of planning, the team de
vised post-competition plans for the home,
which took first place in Affordability and third
place in Market Appeal.
"Stanford doesn't exactly have a lot of extra
real estate that you could just have a house on,"
said Communications Lead Lilly Shi 'l4 M.S. 'l6.
When Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve di
rector Philippe Cohen revealed that his staff
had been meaning to build a home for the pre

serve ranger and his family, "everything came
together," Shi said.
Engineering Advisor Richard Wang Ph.D.
'l5, who has worked with the Solar Decathlon
team at the California Institute of Technolo
gy, explained that it is uncommon for De
cathlon homes to go into functional use post
competition.
"A few of [the Decathlon homes] go to fami
lies, but a lot of them become show houses or are
torn down after the competition," Wang said.
The road to Solar Decathlon
The road from designing
the home to gaining approval
to turning the home into a
residence has been a long
one.
Though the Department
of Energy launched Solar De
cathlon in 2002, Start.Home
marked the University's first
foray into the competition,
which takes place once every
two years. Professor Banny
Banerjee served as the fac
ulty advisor for the 2013
project.
Wang estimated that the
project took over 10,000
man-hours and $1 million in
University funding and cor
porate sponsorships to com
plete.
The Start.Home team,
which consisted of students
in fields ranging from prod
uct design to mechanical en
gineering, launched prepa
rations for the design of the
home in the fall of 2011.
Physical construction of the
home commenced in March
2013, following one and a half
years of planning.

Students on the team
were expected to contribute
not only knowledge they had
developed through their re
spective fields of study, but
also partake in the physical
construction of the home
albeit with the help of a pro
fessional carpenters union
and Stanford Land, Build
ings and Real Estate.
"Most of it including
putting in the plumbing sys
tems, electrical systems and
things like that was done
by the students," Wang said.
"Sometimes you can find
guides or tutorials online ...
but a lot of it is learning from
scratch."
"A lot of the students had
never used a hammer be
fore," Shi noted. "It was real
ly stressful because it was
more responsibility than I
think any of us had ever
had."
But after months of con
struction, Shi said the mo
ment of the home's unveiling
was worth it.
"It was incredible to see
the roof lift up off the house
the way you had designed it,"
she said. "All of a sudden, the
pictures from your computer
are real life, and there's this
sense of, 'Oh my God, I did
that.'"

The future of the Decathlon
As preparations to turn
Start.Home into a residence
are underway, the Stanford
Solar Decathlon team is al
ready gearing up for the 2015
competition.
Students interested in
building the University's
next entry have signed up for

a two-course series one of
fered this past spring and one
offered this summer de
voted to developing project
management, design and
competitive testing skills.
Shi, reflecting on her De
cathlon experience, called
Start.Home a rare opportuni
ty to partake in "a real-world,

real-scale project."
"A lot of what we do in
classes is theoretical, but the
Decathlon project is an oppor
tunity to apply what you learn
in class," Shi said. "We growup
and we're told to do things
without always being told why
... But with this project, you're
not expected to build some sort

of scale model. You're expected
to build something that a fami
ly can live in. You have respon
sibility, more than I think any
of us had ever had before, but
that's also the reason why it
was really rewarding."

the home to gaining approval
to turning the home into a
residence has been a long
one.
Though the Department
of Energy launched Solar De
cathlon in 2002, Start.Home
marked the University's first
foray into the competition,
which takes place once every
two years. Professor Banny
Banerjee served as the fac
ulty advisor for the 2013
project.
Wang estimated that the
project took over 10,000
man-hours and $1 million in
University funding and cor
porate sponsorships to com
plete.
The Start.Home team,
which consisted of students
in fields ranging from prod
uct design to mechanical en
gineering, launched prepa
rations for the design of the
home in the fall of 2011.
Physical construction of the
home commenced in March
2013, following one and a half
years of planning.

Students on the team
were expected to contribute
not only knowledge they had
developed through their re
spective fields of study, but
also partake in the physical
construction of the home
albeit with the help of a pro
fessional carpenters union
and Stanford Land, Build
ings and Real Estate.
"Most of it including
putting in the plumbing sys
tems, electrical systems and
things like that was done
by the students," Wang said.
"Sometimes you can find
guides or tutorials online ...
but a lot of it is learning from
scratch."
"A lot of the students had
never used a hammer be
fore," Shi noted. "It was real
ly stressful because it was
more responsibility than I
think any of us had ever
had."
But after months of con
struction, Shi said the mo
ment of the home's unveiling
was worth it.
"It was incredible to see
the roof lift up off the house
the way you had designed it,"
she said. "All of a sudden, the
pictures from your computer
are real life, and there's this
sense of, 'Oh my God, I did
that.'"

The future of the Decathlon
As preparations to turn
Start.Home into a residence
are underway, the Stanford
Solar Decathlon team is al
ready gearing up for the 2015
competition.
Students interested in
building the University's
next entry have signed up for

a two-course series one of
fered this past spring and one
offered this summer de
voted to developing project
management, design and
competitive testing skills.
Shi, reflecting on her De
cathlon experience, called
Start.Home a rare opportuni
ty to partake in "a real-world,

real-scale project."
"A lot of what we do in
classes is theoretical, but the
Decathlon project is an oppor
tunity to apply what you learn
in class," Shi said. "We growup
and we're told to do things
without always being told why
... But with this project, you're
not expected to build some sort

of scale model. You're expected
to build something that a fami
ly can live in. You have respon
sibility, more than I think any
of us had ever had before, but
that's also the reason why it
was really rewarding."

After over 10,000 man-hours and $1 million in University funding and corporate sponsorships, the student-designed and
student-built Start.Home recently received county approval to serve as a residence in Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve.
Start.Home, Stanford Solar Decathlon's
most recent project, recently received county
approval to serve as a residence for the Jasper
Ridge Biological Preserve park ranger and his
family.
Start.Home is the team's student-de
signed and student-built entry into the 2013
U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon.
The home, which is now located at Jasper
Ridge, features net-zero energy use and sus

tainable materials.

Start.Home at Jasper Ridge
In the early stages of planning, the team de
vised post-competition plans for the home,
which took first place in Affordability and third
place in Market Appeal.
"Stanford doesn't exactly have a lot of extra
real estate that you could just have a house on,"
said Communications Lead Lilly Shi 'l4 M.S. 'l6.
When Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve di
rector Philippe Cohen revealed that his staff
had been meaning to build a home for the pre

serve ranger and his family, "everything came
together," Shi said.
Engineering Advisor Richard Wang Ph.D.
'l5, who has worked with the Solar Decathlon
team at the California Institute of Technolo
gy, explained that it is uncommon for De
cathlon homes to go into functional use post
competition.
"A few of [the Decathlon homes] go to fami
lies, but a lot of them become show houses or are
torn down after the competition," Wang said.
