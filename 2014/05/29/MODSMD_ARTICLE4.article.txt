## Decathlon home relocates to Jasper Ridge 
### MADELEINE HAN DESK EDITOR 
Start.Home, Stanford Solar Decathlon's
most recent project, recently received county
approval to serve as a residence for the Jasper
Ridge Biological Preserve park ranger and his
family.
Start.Home is the team's student-de
signed and student-built entry into the 2013
U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon.
The home, which is now located at Jasper
Ridge, features net-zero energy use and sus

tainable materials.

In the early stages of planning, the team de
vised post-competition plans for the home,
which took first place in Affordability and third
place in Market Appeal.
"Stanford doesn't exactly have a lot of extra
real estate that you could just have a house on,"
said Communications Lead Lilly Shi 'l4 M.S. 'l6.
When Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve di
rector Philippe Cohen revealed that his staff
had been meaning to build a home for the pre

serve ranger and his family, "everything came
together," Shi said.
Engineering Advisor Richard Wang Ph.D.
'l5, who has worked with the Solar Decathlon
team at the California Institute of Technolo
gy, explained that it is uncommon for De
cathlon homes to go into functional use post
competition.
"A few of [the Decathlon homes] go to fami
lies, but a lot of them become show houses or are
torn down after the competition," Wang said.
