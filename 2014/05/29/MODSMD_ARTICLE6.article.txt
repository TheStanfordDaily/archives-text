## Researchers use batteries to capture and convert heat energy 
### â€“ Peter Samuel Moon 
Researchers Seok Woo Lee 'O9 Ph.D. 'll and
Yi Cui from Stanford and Yuan Yang and Gang
Chen from MIT have found a new battery tech
nology that captures waste heat and converts it
into electricity, a finding which was published in
the journal Nature Communications last week.
In the past, scientists focused on thermo
electric devices, solid-state materials that can
produce electricity from a temperature gradi
ent, to harness waste heat.
However, these researchers found an alter
native for low-temperature waste-heat conver
sion into electricity, utilizing a scientific princi
ple known as the thermogalvanic effect which
states that the voltage of a rechargeable bat
tery is dependent on temperature.
According to Lee, the technique is to subject
a battery to a four-step process: heating up,
charging, cooling down and discharging.
"The results are very promising," comment
ed Peidong Yang, a professor of chemistry at
the University of California, Berkeley. "By ex
ploring the thermogalvanic effect, [the MIT
and Stanford researchers] were able to convert
low-grade heat to electricity with decent effi
ciency."
