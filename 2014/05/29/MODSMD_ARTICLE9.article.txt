## Q&A In search of assertiveness and common ground 
### George Shultz 
This is a transcript of an in
terview with George Shultz, the
U.S. Secretary of State under
President Ronald Reagan.
This interview is part of The
Daily's "Ideas of an Interna
tional Order" series, running
from April 27-30, 201b, which
explores the potential for evolv
ing and. contrasting concepts
of an international system in
the 21st century, and what
America can or should do in
response.

The Stanford Daily (TSD):
What do you think recent events in
international affairs show us about
our current situation?
George Shultz (GS): In recent
years, Putin has been taking steps
to implement his broad objectives
of seeking dominance in all of the
former Soviet states. That's what
he wants to do. That's what the
Georgia business was about. That's
what the Ukrainian and Crimean
business is about. That's his objec
tive. He may make tactical moves
now and then or say things, but we
should realize, that's his objective.
So when we say to ourselves,
what are his tools, his biggest tool is
his supply of oil and gas in most of
these countries. It means that they
are pretty much dependent on the
Russians. The Baltic States are
almost wholly dependent. He's
shown that he's perfectly willing to
cut off those supplies if he thinks
that it will further his objectives.
That means that from our stand
point we want to lessen that
dependence, and while I don't claim
to have studied this issue extensively,
my instinct is that if we go about it
with some energy and cohesion
among our allies, we can do that.
For example, an LNG-receiving
ship has put into port in Lithuania
recently, so it's got to have some
LNG coming. It is reported that
there is potential shale oil possible
in Poland if we work at it. There has
recently been some discoveries
around Cyprus. And so we should
be working hard to create these
developments and lessen that
dependence.
We also know that he is threat
ening military action all the time.
So we need to be sure that our
NATO forces are adequate and
alert. We have been falling behind
in that regard. But it is not a huge
cost to the United States to get
ourselves in better shape, so we should.
We also need to recognize that to
some degree, his strengths are his
weaknesses. That is, his economy is
dependent on selling oil and gas.
Very dependent. He also has a de
mographic catastrophe on his
hands. That is, fertility is very low.
Men only live to the age of 60 on
average it's appalling! And then
the working-age groups, 35-50
men die at a rate far in excess of
normal OECD countries. So he has
that problem. He has practically an
open rebellion on his hands in the
Caucasus, in Islamic lands there.
And while he has recently had an
agreement with China, the reality
is also that [there is a] long border
with China on one side are lots of
resources and hardly anybody, on
the other side are lots of people and
seepage is taking place. So there's
an instability there.
We need to be conscious of what
he's trying to do and have a strate
gy for countering it. Having in mind
that we don't want to see an
outcome that is a kind of revival of
the Cold War, and we certainly
wouldn't want to see the collapse of
Russia, that's where we are.
TSD: Do you believe that we're
at risk of that kind of situation re
sembling a second Cold War?
GS: There's a risk of that. We
don't want to fall into that trap. We
want to align up, having called all
this off and given Putin a lesson,
and we want to see Russia be part of
the larger community not isolated
from it. After all, Russia brings a lot
to the world. It has world-class
music and dance and literature and
science. Its best young people are
emigrating Silicon Valley's full
of them.
TSD: What about China, then?
Do you believe that China's pre
senting any sort of alternative, or
do you believe that it's working
within the same framework whose
institutions we have in part de
signed?

GS: China is in much healthier
shape, really, than Russia. And of
course it's much larger. I think
having a reasonably constructive
relationship with China is both
possible and desirable, but we have
to work at it.
For example, China has a huge
pollution problem. And that pollu
tion is related to the more global
issue of carbon in the air and the
warming of the planet. I believe, for
example, that we ought to get
together with the Chinese and make
a deal on intellectual property so you
get that out of the way, and then
work to see everything possible
that we can do underline the
word do that will help with these
problems.
It's okay to see aspirations, but
aspirations aren't the same as
doing. Here's an example. I was in
Beijing a couple of years ago and I
had a meeting with the Premier. It
took me about three-quarters of an
hour to go from my hotel to where
he was. If there were no traffic, it
would have taken about ten min
utes. Most of the time my car was
parked, idling. While it's idling, it's
polluting the air. I said to him, you
knov; when I drive around Stanford,
when my car is stopped nothing is
happening because the electric
motor carries it forward—it doesn't
have to idle. If you made a big effort
to introduce hybrid cars or electric
cars, you'd clear up a lot of this
pollution. It isn't like it's a no-no. If
we could make common cause and if
we had success between the two
countries, other countries would
join in.
TSD: What do you think should
be the guiding principles for the
sort of strategies that you're
talking about going forward not
just for Russia but for other
countries as well? What should be
our aims, what should be our goals
going forward?
GS: We should help the other
world with peace and prosperity. So
we want to do what we can to help
bring that about. The key, to begin
with, is having our own economy be
more prosperous than it has been
recently. I believe that can be done.
I think it's also important that
we be strong, and strength is not
just military strength but economic
strength, and strength of willpower
to be willing to go and help
peoples. We shouldn't be a specta
tor, we should be a participant, and
a helpful participant.
Another example let's take
the country of Jordan. Jordan sits
next to Syria. It is being inundated
with Syrian refugees, and refugee
camps and only a minority of
refugees are in the camps. They are
also all over Jordan, so it's a huge
problem. How do you cope with it?
And we should be helping them
cope. There are medical issues, I'm
sure; there are all kinds of issues.
But we should be helping them
solve the problem. That's another
example of something we should be
ready to do.

U.S. Secretary of State under
President Ronald Reagan.
This interview is part of The
Daily's "Ideas of an Interna
tional Order" series, running
from April 27-30, 201b, which
explores the potential for evolv
ing and. contrasting concepts
of an international system in
the 21st century, and what
America can or should do in
response.

The Stanford Daily (TSD):
What do you think recent events in
international affairs show us about
our current situation?
George Shultz (GS): In recent
years, Putin has been taking steps
to implement his broad objectives
of seeking dominance in all of the
former Soviet states. That's what
he wants to do. That's what the
Georgia business was about. That's
what the Ukrainian and Crimean
business is about. That's his objec
tive. He may make tactical moves
now and then or say things, but we
should realize, that's his objective.
So when we say to ourselves,
what are his tools, his biggest tool is
his supply of oil and gas in most of
these countries. It means that they
are pretty much dependent on the
Russians. The Baltic States are
almost wholly dependent. He's
shown that he's perfectly willing to
cut off those supplies if he thinks
that it will further his objectives.
That means that from our stand
point we want to lessen that
dependence, and while I don't claim
to have studied this issue extensively,
my instinct is that if we go about it
with some energy and cohesion
among our allies, we can do that.
For example, an LNG-receiving
ship has put into port in Lithuania
recently, so it's got to have some
LNG coming. It is reported that
there is potential shale oil possible
in Poland if we work at it. There has
recently been some discoveries
around Cyprus. And so we should
be working hard to create these
developments and lessen that
dependence.
We also know that he is threat
ening military action all the time.
So we need to be sure that our
NATO forces are adequate and
alert. We have been falling behind
in that regard. But it is not a huge
cost to the United States to get
ourselves in better shape, so we should.
We also need to recognize that to
some degree, his strengths are his
weaknesses. That is, his economy is
dependent on selling oil and gas.
Very dependent. He also has a de
mographic catastrophe on his
hands. That is, fertility is very low.
Men only live to the age of 60 on
average it's appalling! And then
the working-age groups, 35-50
men die at a rate far in excess of
normal OECD countries. So he has
that problem. He has practically an
open rebellion on his hands in the
Caucasus, in Islamic lands there.
And while he has recently had an
agreement with China, the reality
is also that [there is a] long border
with China on one side are lots of
resources and hardly anybody, on
the other side are lots of people and
seepage is taking place. So there's
an instability there.
We need to be conscious of what
he's trying to do and have a strate
gy for countering it. Having in mind
that we don't want to see an
outcome that is a kind of revival of
the Cold War, and we certainly
wouldn't want to see the collapse of
Russia, that's where we are.
TSD: Do you believe that we're
at risk of that kind of situation re
sembling a second Cold War?
GS: There's a risk of that. We
don't want to fall into that trap. We
want to align up, having called all
this off and given Putin a lesson,
and we want to see Russia be part of
the larger community not isolated
from it. After all, Russia brings a lot
to the world. It has world-class
music and dance and literature and
science. Its best young people are
emigrating Silicon Valley's full
of them.
TSD: What about China, then?
Do you believe that China's pre
senting any sort of alternative, or
do you believe that it's working
within the same framework whose
institutions we have in part de
signed?

GS: China is in much healthier
shape, really, than Russia. And of
course it's much larger. I think
having a reasonably constructive
relationship with China is both
possible and desirable, but we have
to work at it.
For example, China has a huge
pollution problem. And that pollu
tion is related to the more global
issue of carbon in the air and the
warming of the planet. I believe, for
example, that we ought to get
together with the Chinese and make
a deal on intellectual property so you
get that out of the way, and then
work to see everything possible
that we can do underline the
word do that will help with these
problems.
It's okay to see aspirations, but
aspirations aren't the same as
doing. Here's an example. I was in
Beijing a couple of years ago and I
had a meeting with the Premier. It
took me about three-quarters of an
hour to go from my hotel to where
he was. If there were no traffic, it
would have taken about ten min
utes. Most of the time my car was
parked, idling. While it's idling, it's
polluting the air. I said to him, you
knov; when I drive around Stanford,
when my car is stopped nothing is
happening because the electric
motor carries it forward—it doesn't
have to idle. If you made a big effort
to introduce hybrid cars or electric
cars, you'd clear up a lot of this
pollution. It isn't like it's a no-no. If
we could make common cause and if
we had success between the two
countries, other countries would
join in.
TSD: What do you think should
be the guiding principles for the
sort of strategies that you're
talking about going forward not
just for Russia but for other
countries as well? What should be
our aims, what should be our goals
going forward?
GS: We should help the other
world with peace and prosperity. So
we want to do what we can to help
bring that about. The key, to begin
with, is having our own economy be
more prosperous than it has been
recently. I believe that can be done.
I think it's also important that
we be strong, and strength is not
just military strength but economic
strength, and strength of willpower
to be willing to go and help
peoples. We shouldn't be a specta
tor, we should be a participant, and
a helpful participant.
Another example let's take
the country of Jordan. Jordan sits
next to Syria. It is being inundated
with Syrian refugees, and refugee
camps and only a minority of
refugees are in the camps. They are
also all over Jordan, so it's a huge
problem. How do you cope with it?
And we should be helping them
cope. There are medical issues, I'm
sure; there are all kinds of issues.
But we should be helping them
solve the problem. That's another
example of something we should be
ready to do.
