## Dive for dreams 
### Hana Kajimura 
I liked the way the words felt as they rolled
over my tongue and hung idly in the back of
my mind. But they never really sunk in until
today: "Dive for dreams or a slogan may top
ple you (trees are their roots and wind is
wind)."
These are the opening lines of a poem by
e.e. cummings, a poem my litle sister featured
atop her high school graduation cap last
spring. In the last year, these words have be
come my every ambition. "Trees are their
roots," he wrote, communicating so much
profundity with so few words. When we dive
for dreams, we must remember to jump from
a position of strength, rather than grasping at
what lies just beyond our fingertips.
It's a lesson we've learned (and re
learned) a million times over. Master the ba
sics before you attempt the dunk, wind up for
a bicycle kick or hang ten. Push up from your
legs; don't pull with your arms. Build the foun
dation before you try the trick or else you
might get embarrassed, or worse, hurt.
The hard part about learning the lesson is
that we often don't realize how good we've
gotten until we attempt the trick. And a life
time of pushups seems pointless with nothing
to show our friends.
For me, it was a lifetime bopping around
a five-mile radius in Palo Alto. I had never been
away from the comforts of home for more
than a few days at a time. When all of my
friends flew across the country for college, I
moved across the street. I didn't learn that
"trees are their roots" until I studied abroad in
South Africa as a sophomore. -
At the Cape Town airport, I sat on top of
my duffel next to a boy and a girl with familiar
faces and last names I couldn't remember. I
wished more than anything to leap back from
continent to continent safely home, to the
side of my bed that was still warm when I left
in the dark.
But as we drove away from the airport,
headed for our new home in Cape Town, I felt
grateful for the 18 years that had prepared me
for this new adventure. For the time I visited
a teen sex ed workshop in Mexico City (with
my mom when I was 9) and the HIV/AIDS clin
ic in Ethiopia. For the conversations my family
had growing up about what it meant to be bi
racial. I might have been the youngest one in
the South Africa program, but I was as ready
as anyone.
Graduation is our next hurdle. Many of

us feel like we want more time or we don't de
serve the diploma. Thoughts of what-ifs and if
onlys haunt us into our final days (thank god
for March 14). I, too, am nothing short of ter
rified to wake up on Monday, June 16.
But that morning will come, and in my
heart of hearts, I know we will be ready.
For four years, Stanford has been our
playground. An arena of tools at our disposal
books, machines, money, Nobel Prizewin
ners and probably the best dating pool we will
ever know. Stanford gave us a platform to ex
press ourselves freely to speak up, to sing
out, to listen. To invite our idols for a visit with
the Stanford name behind us. Think about the
number of emails you've started with "my
name is X and I'm a Stanford student" and
where they have led you.
We are lucky. At Stanford, you can
dance or laugh or cry or nap at any hour of
any day. We have stretched ourselves past
the limits we thought we knew, and have
grown as a result. We have enrolled in way
too many units because we just have to
take "Sex, Rock, and Rebellion," and taken
on too many student groups because the
communities are just too special to pass up.
Those Tuesday night formals, Wednesday
night Happy Hours and Thursday Senior
Nights taughv us time management. The
roommate that kept you up talking all night
taught you to connect. The conversations
whispered between two twin XL mattresses
taught us to connect.
We don't leave these memories behind:
we build upon them. They are the roots that
will determine our success when the wind
blows. We are more than prepared to sit
across the table from politicians and give ad
vice to Fortune 500 CEOs and direct millions
of dollars at leading NGOs. We just don't real
ize it yet.
Maybe you don't believe me and maybe
we won't believe in ourselves until tomorrow
comes. But dive for dreams, trust your heart,
the poem tells us. "Honor the past but wel
come the future."
As I prepare to graduate, 1 sit back into
these words a little more. I pull them over and
around me. Because they tell me to be more
kind and less afraid. Let them empower you to
follow opportunity and take the plunge.
You've spent four years building the foun
dation. Now it's time to try the trick.
