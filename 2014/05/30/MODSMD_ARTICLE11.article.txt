# ROAD TO GLORY
## ANDERSON DISCUSSES FAMILY, FOOTBALL, CAREER 
### WINSTON SHI MANAGING EDITOR 
There are three months to go
until the start of the 2014
football season, and Lance An
derson is enjoying a rare peri
od of free time in what is oth
erwise a hectic life. Football fanatics like
to talk about Saban's "Process" and Bill
Belichick's notorious work ethic, but
every staff does a ton of planning.

We romanticize football as the stuff
of "Remember the Titans" and of two-a
days in the hot Virginia summer, with
sunshine and sweat and coaches scream
ing and cleats slowly grinding the prac
tice field into mush. Anderson does that
too, but the life of a football coach is
mostly consumed by film, recruiting and
a never ending deluge of meetings.
Football is more of a desk job than

most people would like to admit. It is
less strictly regimented during the off
season than during the season, when the
work gets to a point where David Shaw
cuts off the food supply to the office to
force the coaches to have dinner with
their families. However, there is still
work to be done year-round.
♦ ♦♦
Anderson's cheerful demeanor be
lies the sort of inner obsession that
being a football coach requires.
"My whole world kind of revolves
around football," he says. "Sometimes,
I have to pinch myself to really believe
that 'hey, I'm getting paid to do this.'"
Little other than that kind of fixa
tion on football could justify the sacri
fices endemic to coaching otherwise. It
was surprising to hear Shannon Turley
declare last year that "if there's some
thing else that you could do and be

happy, then you should go do that." But
as it turns out, that is part and parcel of
being a football coach.
Even in the offseason, when the
coaching staff can only spend eight
hours a week with the team, the Stan
ford coaches put in the work. They go
over film, prepare presentations and sit
in meetings. They recruit constantly,
emailing and messaging prospects,
breaking down high school film and
calling coaches across the country.
Becoming defensive coordinator
has not ended Anderson's recruiting
days. Indeed, when he was still at Stan
ford, Derek Mason worked with Ander
son in Arizona, while overseeing re
cruiting in Georgia and large areas of
Florida. Even now, Anderson often
does double duty on the recruiting

Stanford defensive coordinator and recruiter extraordinaire Lance Anderson seeks to forge closer relationships with his defensive
players. He demonstrates that a coach's work is never done, constantly and tirelessly working around the clock.
front, handling relations with the
admissions office while at the same
time, personally recruiting key
areas of the country; he has been
the point man in fertile recruiting
grounds like Arizona, San Diego
and Alabama in the past.
Yet despite recruiting, it is
planning that absorbs the better
part of Anderson's time. With
coaching hours on the practice
field at such a premium, the coach
es need to be ready for everything
that might happen on the field.
Every hour of practice is carefully
scripted beforehand. Every play
made or not made in practice is
painstakingly watched, broken
down, analyzed.
Every coach handles a specific
phase of the game last year, An
derson broke down opposing of
fenses' tendencies in short-yardage
and goal-line situations. This
means that if one coach fails, the
entire team's success may be in
jeopardy. As such, coaches always
put in the time.
It is not surprising, then, that
the idea of free time is, in large
part, alien to a football coach. Even
in the spring, the coaches often
come in before 7 a.m. and do not
make it back home until 11 at
night. When the coaches do get to
go home early, there are still emails
to check, calls to make and film to
watch.
Anderson a father of three
is unfazed. "We can always usu
ally get home," he says. In perspec
tive, getting home is actually a bit
of an achievement, a victory of the
Shaw-Harbaugh era that is often
overlooked.
♦ ♦♦
"There were some things early
on that Coach Harbaugh asked
about and some things that he
identified that would help the pro
gram, and the athletic director, Bob
Bowlsby, did a great job to try to ad
dress those needs in those areas,
like the housing," Anderson ex
plains. "When I first got here, there
wasn't all the housing on campus.
We were given a housing stipend,
which was really nice, but now the
housing they provide on campus

has been great.
"It's expensive to live in this
area. There's no question... In the
past it probably [made it harder to
hire a good coaching staff]," he
continues. "One of the great things
that Stanford has done as part of
our conversation is that we are pro
vided housing. Most of the coaches
are on campus in the housing
there. The home my family and I
live in, Stanford owns in Menlo
Park."
"Before we got here, a lot of
the coaches were living out in the
East Bay or down in Morgan Hill or
something and had to spend a lot of
time commuting," he concludes.
"When you're in situations like
that, sometimes you're forced to
sleep in the office because you
don't have the time to make that
commute ... that's tough on a fam
ily, when you're going to have to
say, 'We're going to live 45 minutes
away, we've got to live an hour
away and make that commute
every day.'"
A 45-minute commute, 20
hours of practice in the season,
eight hours in the offseason, prac
tices scripted in five-minute incre
ments ... football coaches are con
stantly surrounded by these re
minders of the importance of time,
not only with the players on the
practice field but also with the fam
ilies at home.
Even for unmarried coaches, a
respite from the coaching grind is
always appreciated. Coaches, who
spend most of their time talking to
their fellow coaches, team mem
bers and recruits many of
whom they will only speak to a few
times in their lives find solace
in family; they also find solace in ca
maraderie.
"As a very young coach in this
profession, it's kind of what I'm
trying to wade through right now,
when I'll find that time," quarter
backs coach Tavita Pritchard said to
The Daily last year. "Our head
coach is very rare when it comes to
how head coaches deal with this
crazy profession. And so he makes
it very clear from the get-go how
important it is to make time for

family and free time, because as
you can see, a lot of our coaches are
young, relatively, and they have
young families and they do a good
job of getting and spending time
with their families."
Anderson concurs. "My family
comes over for practice a lot. And
sometimes, just those few minutes
you're able to see them at practice
... they feel more of a part of it."
"On Tuesday nights, we have
family dinner. So after that Tuesday
practice, we come in, we usually
have dinner down in Jimmy V's as a
staff and our families come. Even
that hour we're able to spend down
there at dinner is great, and it's
easy to do that because every
body's so close. It's not like any
body's making that 45-minute or
hour drive. I think that's been very
helpful since we've been here, just
in terms of hiring a staff and getting
good quality coaches here, and
then getting them to stay here."
♦ ♦♦
Perhaps surprisingly, between
all the pressures and demands,
most coaches do not get much of
an opportunity to meet the players
on the team in a more personal
context. Anderson is a bit unique,
though, in his role as both coach
and admissions guru.
"The good thing over the years
that I've been here, especially
doing all the admissions stuff, is
I've had a chance to interact and
communicate with almost every
one we've recruited, just because
of all the admission stuff going on,"
Anderson says. "At the same time,
I've been able to recruit a lot of
great guys from my recruiting area
which has been fun, but it's been

good knowing all the kids in the
class. During the recruiting
process you get to spend a lot of
time with kids... You start to devel
op that relationship with them, and
you see how they develop and how
they change over time."
Once the recruits become
Stanford students, things are dif
ferent. "We're limited by how
much time we can spend with
those guys in terms of meetings,
practice and things like that. A kid
can stop in and say hello, but out
side the 20 hours or eight hours a
week that you're allowed, you're
not able to do too much football
stuff with them," Anderson ad
mits.
"As the coordinator now, one
of the things I'm trying to do is de
velop a good relationship with all
the players on defense. It's impor
tant for me to try to get to under
stand each of those guys, under
stand what makes them tick and
what's important to them and learn
a little bit about their personality. I
think that's important to know as
you coach those guys. You want to
get the most out of them. You want
what's best for them, and I think
it's important to get to know them
in order to do that... looking for
those little opportunities too,
[where] you can help, you can in
teract."
" [Anderson] does a good job of
relating to the players," said Vic
Fangio. "To be a coach, you have to
be a teacher... He's always work
ing. If he's not working on football,
he's working on recruiting. He
spends more time at the office than
anybody."
"He shows up before any

body," Trent Murphy agreed when
interviewed by Stanford Athletics
last fall. "I think it speaks volumes
about how we play on Saturdays."

There exists, in Anderson's
mind at least, an alternate universe
in which he is not a college football
coach, but a pharmacist working in
his hometown of Rupert, Idaho.
"I grew up playing football,"
Anderson says. "Going to school, I
thought I was going to go to med
ical school or go to pharmacy
school and be a pharmacist... I
thought that I would love to coach,
but I didn't know if that would be
the best job, the most stable job. I
finally reached the point where I
was in the pharmacy program at
Idaho State [where Anderson
played for two years] and pretty
much settled on doing that."
At the time, Anderson was still
mulling football. "I'm never going
to know if I would be successful
doing that unless I try it," he told
himself. "I talked to my wife about
it and we talked about it, and I de
cided that this was something I
wanted to try, this was something I
wanted to do. She was very sup
portive of it."
"You know, at the time, I
thought I'd probably be coaching in
high school football or something
like that, and I was prepared to say,
okay, I'm in the pharmacy program,
let's just finish up my degree. I can
get a degree in biology or chem
istry real quick and get my teaching
credential. I can do that. And that
was what I kind of planned on
doing."
When a coaching position
opened up at Idaho State, Ander
son had found his big break. Start
ing out working with Derek Mason
on the Bengals' offensive staff, the
two began the long, slow and end
lessly itinerant climb up the coach
ing ladder, one that typically takes
at least two decades.
"My first three jobs, Derek
helped me get," Anderson recalls.
College coaches will not be
surprised to hear how Anderson

"He's always working. If he's
not working on football he's
working on recruiting."

VIC FANGIO,
former defensive coordinator
bounced around the coaching ranks, in
cluding two stops with teams that were
themselves short-lived the Mobile Ad
mirals RFL team and the D-II team at St.
Mary's, neither of which now exist.
Mason campaigned for Anderson to join
him at Bucknell, where he met future
Stanford inside linebackers coach David
Kotulski and started coaching defense for
the first time; later, the two were co-de
fensive coordinators at St. Mary's before
reuniting at Stanford.
"Those early days coaching, you're
getting a lot of the entry-level jobs re
stricted earnings, GA, intern-type jobs,
and it's not easy to make it, not easy to find
those jobs," Anderson reminisces. "I've
been lucky I've been around a lot of good
people."
Anderson has rapidly made his name
among the Stanford staff since joining Jim
Harbaugh at San Diego in 2005, and after
his achievements with Stanford's pass
rush were noted, his future ascension to
defensive coordinator was clear.
" [David Shaw] 's talked to me about it
over the last few years, that there would
be an opportunity here eventually," he
said. "I was very excited for the opportu
nity when it came up this year."
Looking at his track record, it is clear
that Anderson deserves his shot. He has
become the defensive coordinator for one
of the best teams in America, so he has
achieved a lot. The price he has paid in the
past has led to the well-deserved success
of the present. Stanford's defense is in
good hands.
But what about the future? Is Ander
son thinking about the future the
same future that motivates coaches every
where? Does Lance Anderson see himself
as a head coach down the road?
"I think I would, someday... I think
most coaches would, at some point," An
derson said but he says it in the same
way that a rookie says I would like to be
come an NFL MVP or a college pharmacy
student says I would like to be a college
football coach. But there's still plenty of
time to go, and far too many days left, and
a seeming world of time before Ander
son's defense even plays its first snap.
"I never try to look too far ahead," An
derson decides. "Hopefully, this lasts for a
while."
