# ROAD TO GLORY
## ANDERSON DISCUSSES FAMILY, FOOTBALL, CAREER 
### WINSTON SHI MANAGING EDITOR 
There are three months to go
until the start of the 2014
football season, and Lance An
derson is enjoying a rare peri
od of free time in what is oth
erwise a hectic life. Football fanatics like
to talk about Saban's "Process" and Bill
Belichick's notorious work ethic, but
every staff does a ton of planning.

We romanticize football as the stuff
of "Remember the Titans" and of two-a
days in the hot Virginia summer, with
sunshine and sweat and coaches scream
ing and cleats slowly grinding the prac
tice field into mush. Anderson does that
too, but the life of a football coach is
mostly consumed by film, recruiting and
a never ending deluge of meetings.
Football is more of a desk job than

most people would like to admit. It is
less strictly regimented during the off
season than during the season, when the
work gets to a point where David Shaw
cuts off the food supply to the office to
force the coaches to have dinner with
their families. However, there is still
work to be done year-round.

Anderson's cheerful demeanor be
lies the sort of inner obsession that
being a football coach requires.
"My whole world kind of revolves
around football," he says. "Sometimes,
I have to pinch myself to really believe
that 'hey, I'm getting paid to do this.'"
Little other than that kind of fixa
tion on football could justify the sacri
fices endemic to coaching otherwise. It
was surprising to hear Shannon Turley
declare last year that "if there's some
thing else that you could do and be

happy, then you should go do that." But
as it turns out, that is part and parcel of
being a football coach.
Even in the offseason, when the
coaching staff can only spend eight
hours a week with the team, the Stan
ford coaches put in the work. They go
over film, prepare presentations and sit
in meetings. They recruit constantly,
emailing and messaging prospects,
breaking down high school film and
calling coaches across the country.
Becoming defensive coordinator
has not ended Anderson's recruiting
days. Indeed, when he was still at Stan
ford, Derek Mason worked with Ander
son in Arizona, while overseeing re
cruiting in Georgia and large areas of
Florida. Even now, Anderson often
does double duty on the recruiting

players. He demonstrates that a coach's work is never done, constantly and tirelessly working around the clock.
