## Baseball Cardinal ready to roll in Indy 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN STAFF WRITER 
The road ahead appears daunting for Stanford
baseball (30-23, 16-14 Pac-12), as the Card prepare
to enter a hostile postseason environment in Bloom
ington, Indiana, where thousands of relentless fans
and tough competition await.

However, the Cardinal are up to the challenge of
NCAA tournament baseball. All season long, Stan
ford has faced elite competition, and has emerged
from each matchup undeterred and ready to fight in
its next time out.

Stanford certainly was not even supposed to be
here, as "MarkAppel" and "Friday night baseball" are
no longer synonymous on the Farm. In turn, Brian Ra
gira, Justin Ringo and Austin Wilson are also no
longer around to rattle opposing pitchers. In short,
the 2014 rendition of the Card was expected to be
nothing more than a less talented version of last
year's squad, a team that failed to even make the
postseason.

When Stanford begins its postseason journey
against the Indiana State Sycamores (35-16, 14-7
Missouri Valley Conference), the appearance in the
Regionals is more than just a testament to a good sea
son it will mark a major milestone for a team that
was counted out at every conceivable point, but
never bought into the pre-written narrative of its de
mise.

Beginning Friday, the Card will see just how
much magic they have left. As head coach Mark Mar
quess who's set to make his 29th postseason ap
pearance in the last 34 years knows from experi
ence, absolutely anything is possible.
"Normally the team that wins the na
tional championship wins one or two games
that they shouldn't have won ... It's totally
unpredictable. That's just where we are right
now," Marquess said.
While the task is daunting, the situation
is nothing new for a team that has faced chal
lenges all season. From opening with an ex
tremely difficult schedule of Rice, Texas, and
Vanderbilt in successive weekends, to start
ing a freshman pitcher in 42 straight games,
to facing Pac-12 powers Oregon State and
Washington on the road and finishing the
season strong with their backs against the
wall, the Card are playing some of their best
baseball right now.
Pac-12 Freshman of the Year Cal
Quantrill (5-5) the Card's Friday night
starter for most of the year will probably
take the mound in Friday's game against the
Sycamores. Quantrill faced arguably the
harshest debut of any first-year player in col
lege baseball, as he opened the season with
successive starts against Rice and Texas.
The brutal competition, coupled with

the unenviable task of replacing last year's
number one overall draft pick in Appel,
proved to be tough on Quantrill. The Port
Hope, Ontario, native saw his ERA balloon to
13.50 before losing his spot at the top of the
rotation to fellow freshman Brett Hanewich
(3-4).
However, the standout right-hander re
gained the Friday night position in the mid
dle of Pac-12 play, helping guide the Card to
a 19-7 record in their final 26 games.
Another indispensable force behind
Stanford's late-season turnaround was lefty
John Hochstatter (10-1), who has not lost a
start all season since entering the rotation on
April 12 against the Washington Huskies. Be
fore April, the junior, who will likely start the
second game of the regional, was little more
than an afterthought in the Stanford bullpen
shuffle. However, Hochstatter could not lose
down the stretch, finishing the season with a
2.62 ERA.

games in four days in Bloomington,
productive starting pitching and a
consistent bullpen will be para
mount to Stanford's success. For
tunately for the Cardinal, they do
have the necessary personnel in
these departments; sophomore
lefty Logan James has held down
the third spot in the starting rota
tion during Stanford's successful
month of May, and Hanewich also
has the experience to start and de
liver a quality performance.
Finally, senior closer A.J. Vane
gas, who was named to the All-Re
gional team in Stanford's last post
season trip in 2012, will be the elder
statesman for a Cardinal bullpen that
possesses the talent to be a real asset
against the Sycamores.
Offensively, Stanford enters
the postseason firing on all cylin
ders. Junior center fielder Austin
Slater has notched a .455 batting
average since the end of April, and
is in the midst of a 17-game hitting
streak. Along with Slater, sopho
more outfielder Zach JJoffpauir,
the current Pac-12 Player of the

Week, and junior third baseman
Alex Blandino, who finished sec
ond in the conference with 11
home runs, will be looked upon to
drive in runs and help the Card get
out to early leads. Senior first base
man Danny Diekroeger is also a big
threat at the top of the lineup.
"The big difference between
now and the beginning of the sea
son is that we were getting hits,
but what we didn't do early was get
hits with people on base. Nowwe've
gotten the same amount of hits, but
we haven't left as many people on
base," Marquess noted.
The Cardinal certainly have a
travel disadvantage among the
squads competing at the Blooming
ton regional, as Stanford will face
three Midwest teams, beginning
with Indiana State.
The Sycamores are the second
seeded team in the regional, behind
number one seed, host and in-state
rival Indiana. Indiana State earned
an at-large bid into the field of 64 de
spite sputtering down the stretch
and getting bounced early in the

Missouri Valley Conference Tourna
ment.
Nevertheless, the Sycamores
are a talented team. With an RPI of
21 and a potent lineup, featuring

seven qualifying players batting over
.270, Indiana State can put up runs
at will. The Sycamores are led by
senior infielder Derek Hannahs, the
son of first-year head coach Mitch
Hannahs, who comes into the re
gional with a .305 average.
Moreover, with just 60 short
miles separating Terre Haute from
Bloomington, expect the Indiana
State faithful to make the drive up to
Bart Kaufman Field, creating for
all practical purposes a road
game for Stanford.
On Friday, Indiana State will like
ly send out junior David Stagg (7-4) to
square off against Quantrill. Stagg, a
junior college transfer, will also make
his first postseason start against the
Cardinal, so Friday's game just might
come down to which hurler can
maintain his composure in a pres
sure-packed environment.
In the double-elimination for
mat of the Regionals, Stanford will
face either Indiana (42-13, 21-3 Big
Ten) or Youngstown State (16-36, 6-
17 Horizon) in the second game.
The Hoosiers, the No. 4 overall seed
in the NCAA tournament, enter the
postseason scorching hot â€” with
30 victories in its last 33 games. The
Hoosiers have a wealth of talent and
experience both behind the plate

and on the mound, including senior
Dustin Demuth, a consensus All-
American infielder. IU will also lean
on junior Sam Travis, who helped In
diana outscore its conference oppo
nents 161-48. On the rubber, the
Hoosiers also boast the NCAA's ac
tive leader in wins senior lefty
Joey DeNato.
Without a doubt, the Hoosiers
are heavily favored to come out on
top in this regional, with their im
pressive roster and home field ad
vantage. For Stanford to make a seri
ous run, it will have to play some of
its best baseball of the season.
Meanwhile, fourth-seeded
Youngstown State may not look im
posing with its poor regular-season
record, but the Penguins come to
Bloomington with the momentum
of an improbable conference cham
pionship run, and could make
things really interesting with one
or two victories.
Stanford and Indiana State will
meet on Friday at 11 a.m. PST. The
game will be broadcasted on
ESPN3. Regardless of the outcome,
the Cardinal will play again on Sat
urday at a time to be determined.
