## Baseball Cardinal ready to roll in Indy 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN STAFF WRITER 
The road ahead appears daunting for Stanford
baseball (30-23, 16-14 Pac-12), as the Card prepare
to enter a hostile postseason environment in Bloom
ington, Indiana, where thousands of relentless fans
and tough competition await.

However, the Cardinal are up to the challenge of
NCAA tournament baseball. All season long, Stan
ford has faced elite competition, and has emerged
from each matchup undeterred and ready to fight in
its next time out.

Stanford certainly was not even supposed to be
here, as "MarkAppel" and "Friday night baseball" are
no longer synonymous on the Farm. In turn, Brian Ra
gira, Justin Ringo and Austin Wilson are also no
longer around to rattle opposing pitchers. In short,
the 2014 rendition of the Card was expected to be
nothing more than a less talented version of last
year's squad, a team that failed to even make the
postseason.

When Stanford begins its postseason journey
against the Indiana State Sycamores (35-16, 14-7
Missouri Valley Conference), the appearance in the
Regionals is more than just a testament to a good sea
son it will mark a major milestone for a team that
was counted out at every conceivable point, but
never bought into the pre-written narrative of its de
mise.

Beginning Friday, the Card will see just how
much magic they have left. As head coach Mark Mar
quess who's set to make his 29th postseason ap
pearance in the last 34 years knows from experi
ence, absolutely anything is possible.
