### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
No. 2 Stanford women's rowing and Stan
ford men's rowing begin their respective na
tional championship regattas today, as the
women are set to row at the Indianapolis Row
ing Center in Indianapolis, Indiana, and the
men will take the water at Lake Mercer in West
Windsor, Newjersey.
The women seek to win their second
NCAA title in program history. The Card won
the program's first team and varsity eight titles

in 2009, edging out Virginia by 0.3 7 in the var
sity eight Grand Final to claim both titles.
"The whole team is really excited about
the position that we're in, but we're not under
estimating the fact that in rowing, rankings re
ally don't matter until the end," said sopho
more Katie Toothman. "It all comes down to

the grand finals in the NCAAs, so hopefully we
make it."
This year, after upsetting Cal at the annual
Big Row, sweeping the Golden Bears in all three
varsity events and winning the program's first
Pac-12 conference title two weeks ago, the
Card have high hopes heading into this week

end.
"You have to know what it feels like to
leave everything on the water because other
wise you get to NCAAs and it's a shock, so
that's a big thing that we've been focusing on
