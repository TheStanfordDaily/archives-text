## Oars out for nationals Women's, men's crew begin race for national titles 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
No. 2 Stanford women's rowing and Stan
ford men's rowing begin their respective na
tional championship regattas today, as the
women are set to row at the Indianapolis Row
ing Center in Indianapolis, Indiana, and the
men will take the water at Lake Mercer in West
Windsor, Newjersey.
The women seek to win their second
NCAA title in program history. The Card won
the program's first team and varsity eight titles

in 2009, edging out Virginia by 0.3 7 in the var
sity eight Grand Final to claim both titles.
"The whole team is really excited about
the position that we're in, but we're not under
estimating the fact that in rowing, rankings re
ally don't matter until the end," said sopho
more Katie Toothman. "It all comes down to

the grand finals in the NCAAs, so hopefully we
make it."
This year, after upsetting Cal at the annual
Big Row, sweeping the Golden Bears in all three
varsity events and winning the program's first
Pac-12 conference title two weeks ago, the
Card have high hopes heading into this week

end.
"You have to know what it feels like to
leave everything on the water because other
wise you get to NCAAs and it's a shock, so
that's a big thing that we've been focusing on

No. 2 Stanford women's rowing's 1V8 boat and 2V8 boat (above) will be competing for the NCAA title this weekend in the hopes of bringing
back the program's second NCAA title. The women's rowing's first team and individual titles were won in 2009 by a mere 0.37 seconds.
this year," said senior Christina Bax.
"We can't just wait until the NCAAs
to finally discover what it is to go all
out. This season, we are learning
what it means to not hold anything
back and just be relentless."
With the NCAA switching to the
automatic bid system, Stanford was
able to automatically qualify for the
regatta with its conference title. Last
year, the women received an at-large
berth and finished 1 Oth in the team
standings. Toothman pointed out,
though, that the automatic bid sys
tem keeps top leagues, like the Ivy
League, from sending as many top
teams to nationals. In this way, the
change allows smaller conferences to
send their conference champions.
"I'd say in 20 years, this is a good
system but right now we're in the
transition period where it's really
hard," Toothman said. "When I was
getting recruited in talking to coach
es I heard them say that this new au
tomatic bid system was stupid, be
cause what if they don't get a bid to
NCAAs when they are faster than 10
other teams there."
Stanford enters today's races
with the second seed behind defend
ing champion Ohio State. The Card
will be competing in the IVB, 2VB,
and varsity four races. If the boats
win their first heat today, then they
will automatically advance to the
semis on Saturday. In turn, a top two
finish in the semifinals would land
them a spot in the Grand Finals on
Sunday; otherwise, a boat would ad
vance to the B Finals, a race that the
Card competed in last year. A loss in
the preliminary heats would not re
move the Card from semifinal con
sideration. Rather, Stanford would
have to compete in a second "rep" or
heat this afternoon, with the top two
teams from that second heat advanc
ing to the semifinals.
"We're ranked second right now
and Ohio State is first. That being
said, Ohio State hasn't raced a lot of
people, but they are the defending
national champions," Toothman said.
"I'd say between Cal, Ohio State,
Brown, Princeton, those will all be in
the Grand Final and honestly it could
go anyway."

The men will have to undergo a
similar process in order to advance
through the IRA Championship Re
gatta, with their first heats beginning
this morning. The IVB and 2VB
boats both qualified for the champi
onship regatta, and will be compet
ing after the team's most recent
fourth-place finish in the Pac-12
championships.
"We started off this season with
three weeks in a row of racing and
that equates to three weeks of taper
and we had our good pieces and we
had our bad pieces and then [at the
San Diego Crew Classic in April],
when we should've performed in the
final we didn't and I think that started
to lead to a lot of lineup switches and
personnel switches," said junior
Kaess Smit.
All spring, the team has been in
a constant state of flux with regards
to the lineup. Flowever, head coach
Craig Amerkhanian is confident that
the fastest rowers have been placed
in their correct boats.
"The easy part of Craig's job is
figuring out who the best guys are,
but 90 percent of the work is how
they are going to line up behind each
other," said senior Austin Hack, who
will be rowing in his last regatta as a
Cardinal this weekend but will con
tinue rowing for the national team
after graduation.
For much of the season, the Car
dinal could only gauge themselves
against Washington and Cal, the
number one and two teams in the na
tion, so the team is eager to test itself
against other colleges that are similar
in speed to the Card.
Competition begins early this
morning for both the men's and
women's teams, with action continu
ing until Sunday.
