# BACK AND FORTH WITH INDIANA STATE
## 
### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
In advance of Stanford base
ball's upcoming NCAA Regional in
Bloomington, Indiana, The Daily's
Jordan Wallach chatted with Kevin
Jenison, Indiana State baseball's
Sports Information Director, to
get perspective on the Indiana
State Sycamores, the Cardinal's
first opponent in the tourney.
Jordan Wallach (JW): Given
that this is just the second time in the
past 19 seasons that Indiana State
has made the NCAA tournament,
what has been the fan reaction to the
team's newfound success back in
Terre Haute, and what were the ex
pectations coming into this season?
Kevin Jenison (KJ) : Baseball
fans in Terre Haute have a long histo
ry of support for Sycamore baseball
and, for the most part, so have the
students at Indiana State. Unfortu
nately with school over for the
spring, most students have gone
home. Still, we have a very loyal fol
lowing and our allotment of tickets
went fairly quickly.
Few had such lofty expectations
for the Sycamores at the start of the
season. Indiana State was surround
ed by questions about their pitching
staff and a preseason poll of league
coaches picked the Sycamores to fin
ish seventh out of eight teams. Little
did they know that this team would
come together and have such a suc
cessful season.
JW: Despite going into the Missouri
Valley Conference tournament as
the second seed, ISU had a poor
showing in the tourney and was
eliminated in two games. What went
wrong for the team there, and how
can it shake that poor performance
entering the regional?
KJ: What went wrong is a question
that a lot of people have asked and
few can answer. Basically, team

members start
ed to play out-

side of their
capabilities.
In other
words, they
tried to do
more than

they were capa
ble of. When the
team played within

their capabilities this
season, they won. The

quick exit in the conference

tournament brought that
realization to the team and
they have worked hard to

shake that overconfidence
from their swagger.

JW: After starting pitchers Sean
Manaea and Devin Moore, who
combined to start 24 of 51 games for
ISU in the 2013 season, graduated
last year, how has this year's
Sycamore pitching staff developed
and filled the holes? Will there be
enough arms to make it through a
marathon regional tournament if the
team makes it far?
KJ: The Sycamore pitching staff de
veloped into a three-game rotation
with one or two top relievers earn
ing starts in midweek games. The In
diana State coaches took great care
to cultivate the relievers throughout
the season, grooming some for pos
sible starting roles in the postseason
and others into long and short reliev
ers that could be called upon in cer
tain situations. This meant that
some of the pitchers would work
certain days and not others, which
has worked well so far.
JW: What are Indiana State's
strengths and weaknesses heading
into the postseason?
KJ: The main strength of the
Sycamores all season has been the de
fense and skill of the position players.
These players have speed and quick
ness to cover ground and make the

plays.
The weakness,

other than the

questions about the
pitching staff at the

start of the season, is that
the skill of these position players on de
fense did not always correlate with

their offense. Thatwas no more evident
than in the conference tournament.
JW: Which Sycamores should the
Cardinal be most wary of during Fri
day's game in Bloomington?
KJ: Junior center fielder Landon
Curry and senior shortstop Tyler
Wampler are two players to keep an
eye on during the regional tourna
ment. They have had strong seasons
defensively and Curry leads the
team with 18 stolen bases.
JW: Howdoyouthinkthe Sycamores
will fare in the regional playing such
unfamiliar teams, save for Indiana
who they beat on March 26 by a 12-8
score? Care for a prediction?
KJ: This regional is so wide open
that it would not be wise to go be
yond the opening game. That being
said, I believe that the Sycamores are
in the proper frame of mind and if
they can play within their abilities,
they have just as good a chance to
win as everybody else. Of course I
think the Sycamores can win the re
gional title, but it will take their very
best effort.

In advance of Stanford base
ball's upcoming NCAA Regional in
Bloomington, Indiana, The Daily's
Jordan Wallach chatted with Kevin
Jenison, Indiana State baseball's
Sports Information Director, to
get perspective on the Indiana
State Sycamores, the Cardinal's
first opponent in the tourney.
Jordan Wallach (JW): Given
that this is just the second time in the
past 19 seasons that Indiana State
has made the NCAA tournament,
what has been the fan reaction to the
team's newfound success back in
Terre Haute, and what were the ex
pectations coming into this season?
Kevin Jenison (KJ) : Baseball
fans in Terre Haute have a long histo
ry of support for Sycamore baseball
and, for the most part, so have the
students at Indiana State. Unfortu
nately with school over for the
spring, most students have gone
home. Still, we have a very loyal fol
lowing and our allotment of tickets
went fairly quickly.
Few had such lofty expectations
for the Sycamores at the start of the
season. Indiana State was surround
ed by questions about their pitching
staff and a preseason poll of league
coaches picked the Sycamores to fin
ish seventh out of eight teams. Little
did they know that this team would
come together and have such a suc
cessful season.
JW: Despite going into the Missouri
Valley Conference tournament as
the second seed, ISU had a poor
showing in the tourney and was
eliminated in two games. What went
wrong for the team there, and how
can it shake that poor performance
entering the regional?
KJ: What went wrong is a question
that a lot of people have asked and
few can answer. Basically, team

members start
ed to play out-

side of their
capabilities.
In other
words, they
tried to do
more than

they were capa
ble of. When the
team played within

their capabilities this
season, they won. The

quick exit in the conference

tournament brought that
realization to the team and
they have worked hard to

shake that overconfidence
from their swagger.

JW: After starting pitchers Sean
Manaea and Devin Moore, who
combined to start 24 of 51 games for
ISU in the 2013 season, graduated
last year, how has this year's
Sycamore pitching staff developed
and filled the holes? Will there be
enough arms to make it through a
marathon regional tournament if the
team makes it far?
KJ: The Sycamore pitching staff de
veloped into a three-game rotation
with one or two top relievers earn
ing starts in midweek games. The In
diana State coaches took great care
to cultivate the relievers throughout
the season, grooming some for pos
sible starting roles in the postseason
and others into long and short reliev
ers that could be called upon in cer
tain situations. This meant that
some of the pitchers would work
certain days and not others, which
has worked well so far.
JW: What are Indiana State's
strengths and weaknesses heading
into the postseason?
KJ: The main strength of the
Sycamores all season has been the de
fense and skill of the position players.
These players have speed and quick
ness to cover ground and make the

plays.
The weakness,

other than the

questions about the
pitching staff at the

start of the season, is that
the skill of these position players on de
fense did not always correlate with

their offense. Thatwas no more evident
than in the conference tournament.
JW: Which Sycamores should the
Cardinal be most wary of during Fri
day's game in Bloomington?
KJ: Junior center fielder Landon
Curry and senior shortstop Tyler
Wampler are two players to keep an
eye on during the regional tourna
ment. They have had strong seasons
defensively and Curry leads the
team with 18 stolen bases.
JW: Howdoyouthinkthe Sycamores
will fare in the regional playing such
unfamiliar teams, save for Indiana
who they beat on March 26 by a 12-8
score? Care for a prediction?
KJ: This regional is so wide open
that it would not be wise to go be
yond the opening game. That being
said, I believe that the Sycamores are
in the proper frame of mind and if
they can play within their abilities,
they have just as good a chance to
win as everybody else. Of course I
think the Sycamores can win the re
gional title, but it will take their very
best effort.
