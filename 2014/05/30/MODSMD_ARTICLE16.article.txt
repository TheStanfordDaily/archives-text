# Soccer in need of change
## 
### Nicholas Radoff 
If you have not been reminded over and
over by this point, you soon will: the
World Cup is mere weeks away. There
is nothing quite like it, a World's Fair for
nothing but the beautiful game. The
men who will be representing our nation in
Brazil left campus only days ago, ultimately
much fewer in numbers than the men who
arrived.
As much as I would like to avoid ad
dressing the fact that members of the U.S.
Men's National Team (USMNT) could walk
freely around campus, it is impossible to
overlook. It may certainly be said that Stan
ford's unique (in a good way) atmosphere,
which silently respects excellence, con
tributes to the relaxed treatment of the
USMNT.
However, that is less than half the
story. If Leßron James or Peyton Manning or
Beyonce (have you seen her move?) go al
most anywhere in the country, they will
eventually be surrounded by people. Can
you imagine what happens when Leßron
ends up on the streets of Shanghai?
That just does not happen with the gen
tlemen of the USMNT. There are a number
of obvious reasons. Firstly, soccer is not even
close to the most popular sport here. In ad
dition, with the departure of Landon Dono
van, the USMNT lacks a true iconic star.
As such, even though NBC, ESPN/ABC
and Fox have begun to increase the sport's
exposure, one can only feel as though the
popularity of the sport today is the same as
it was four years ago. What's more, there is
a noted absence of nationalism associated
with the World Cup in the U.S.
Here, if you have four favorite teams,
the USMNT may not even be third on your
list. Go ask someone, or better yet, just look
around. You will see Americans in German,
Spanish and Brazilian kits, and I am one of
the worst offenders; out of three jerseys, I
do not even have a U.S. one. I'm pretty sure
that is high treason in some countries.
Do not get me wrong: I root for one
team when the red, white and blue play, and
the international teams' jerseys that I own
are as much mementos of the places I have
visited as they are my love of the sport.
All of this makes me wonder what the
future of soccer will be. Starting next year in

summer of 2015, the World Cup will have
its first competitor: the Basketball World
Cup. Soccer has existed for hundreds of
years and was the benefactor of cultural im
perialism (sorry Europe). Basketball is born
of the 20th century and, in the past two
decades, has caught on like a wildfire.
Basketball is now a global sport, and it
may start to challenge soccer for the global
crown if it continues to grow like it has,
maybe without ever being the most popular
sport in America. Soccer, in turn, is begin
ning to fall behind, as it needs to evolve on
more than just one level.
Think about the rule changes that have
been made in our own sports. Do you know
how old the replay system is in the NFL? Go
ahead, no phone, take a guess right now.
Did you guess 28? Because we are two years
shy of 30 years of video replay in the NFL.
In contrast, 30 years is about how long
it took for FIFA president Sepp Blatter a
man just as wonderful and accommodating
as his name implies to finally adopt goal
line cameras (ok, eight years). The changes
do not have to be monumental. For exam
ple, clock stoppages would help curb fake
injuries and other silly time-wasting tech
niques, like picking up the ball at stoppages.
Or how about a challenge system? Or
more than three subs in a game? I have to
say, if I could see the implementation of one
rule change, it would be the elimination of
the shootout. However, that change will
likely never happen.
Time and time again, small changes like
these have been suggested, yet purists, like
Blatter, are unwilling to even consider it for
no other reason than it is different. Soccer
has not reached any sort of crisis, but there
will be a time soon when the sport will need
to change, as its competition with other
sports grows.
Though I doubt that soccer will ever
truly be supplanted as the world's sport, I
wonder: will soccer evolve, or like boxing,
will FIFA refuse to change its model, and as
a result, be marginalized for it.

after admitting to owning three non-USMNT
jerseys. To suggest places to hide, e-mail

Though I doubt that soccer will ever
truly be supplanted as the world's sport, I
wonder: will soccer evolve, or like boxing,
will FIFA refuse to change its model, and as
a result, be marginalized for it.

If you have not been reminded over and
over by this point, you soon will: the
World Cup is mere weeks away. There
is nothing quite like it, a World's Fair for
nothing but the beautiful game. The
men who will be representing our nation in
Brazil left campus only days ago, ultimately
much fewer in numbers than the men who
arrived.
As much as I would like to avoid ad
dressing the fact that members of the U.S.
Men's National Team (USMNT) could walk
freely around campus, it is impossible to
overlook. It may certainly be said that Stan
ford's unique (in a good way) atmosphere,
which silently respects excellence, con
tributes to the relaxed treatment of the
USMNT.
However, that is less than half the
story. If Leßron James or Peyton Manning or
Beyonce (have you seen her move?) go al
most anywhere in the country, they will
eventually be surrounded by people. Can
you imagine what happens when Leßron
ends up on the streets of Shanghai?
That just does not happen with the gen
tlemen of the USMNT. There are a number
of obvious reasons. Firstly, soccer is not even
close to the most popular sport here. In ad
dition, with the departure of Landon Dono
van, the USMNT lacks a true iconic star.
As such, even though NBC, ESPN/ABC
and Fox have begun to increase the sport's
exposure, one can only feel as though the
popularity of the sport today is the same as
it was four years ago. What's more, there is
a noted absence of nationalism associated
with the World Cup in the U.S.
Here, if you have four favorite teams,
the USMNT may not even be third on your
list. Go ask someone, or better yet, just look
around. You will see Americans in German,
Spanish and Brazilian kits, and I am one of
the worst offenders; out of three jerseys, I
do not even have a U.S. one. I'm pretty sure
that is high treason in some countries.
Do not get me wrong: I root for one
team when the red, white and blue play, and
the international teams' jerseys that I own
are as much mementos of the places I have
visited as they are my love of the sport.
All of this makes me wonder what the
future of soccer will be. Starting next year in

summer of 2015, the World Cup will have
its first competitor: the Basketball World
Cup. Soccer has existed for hundreds of
years and was the benefactor of cultural im
perialism (sorry Europe). Basketball is born
of the 20th century and, in the past two
decades, has caught on like a wildfire.
Basketball is now a global sport, and it
may start to challenge soccer for the global
crown if it continues to grow like it has,
maybe without ever being the most popular
sport in America. Soccer, in turn, is begin
ning to fall behind, as it needs to evolve on
more than just one level.
Think about the rule changes that have
been made in our own sports. Do you know
how old the replay system is in the NFL? Go
ahead, no phone, take a guess right now.
Did you guess 28? Because we are two years
shy of 30 years of video replay in the NFL.
In contrast, 30 years is about how long
it took for FIFA president Sepp Blatter a
man just as wonderful and accommodating
as his name implies to finally adopt goal
line cameras (ok, eight years). The changes
do not have to be monumental. For exam
ple, clock stoppages would help curb fake
injuries and other silly time-wasting tech
niques, like picking up the ball at stoppages.
Or how about a challenge system? Or
more than three subs in a game? I have to
say, if I could see the implementation of one
rule change, it would be the elimination of
the shootout. However, that change will
likely never happen.
Time and time again, small changes like
these have been suggested, yet purists, like
Blatter, are unwilling to even consider it for
no other reason than it is different. Soccer
has not reached any sort of crisis, but there
will be a time soon when the sport will need
to change, as its competition with other
sports grows.
Though I doubt that soccer will ever
truly be supplanted as the world's sport, I
wonder: will soccer evolve, or like boxing,
will FIFA refuse to change its model, and as
a result, be marginalized for it.
