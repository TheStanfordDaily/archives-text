### â€“ Do-Hyoung Park 
Stanford men's tennis head coach John
Whitlinger announced his retirement from
his position on Thursday after 10 seasons at
the helm of the program.
After he took the reins of the program in
2005 following the retirement of Dick
Gould, the Cardinal compiled a 160-85 over
all record and reached the NCAA tourna
ment in nine seasons, including in seven con
secutive years from 2008-2014.
"Being able to coach at a place you've
played is really a dream come true,"
Whitlinger told GoStanford.com. "It's been a
great ride and I want to thank everyone that's
been a part of it, especially the players and
coaches I've worked with over the years. It's
been an honor to coach at such an outstand
ing university and athletic program and while
it's difficult to step away, I'm looking forward

to new beginnings."
Before he was elevated to the head
coaching post, Whitlinger had been the asso
ciate head coach for 18 seasons, a period in
which the Cardinal won nine NCAA titles. In
addition, he had previously spent his colle
giate playing career at Stanford, where he
was awarded All-America honors in both
1974 and 1975. In that 1974 season, he
was key to the Cardinal's success, as he led
the team to an NCAA title while also win
ning both the singles and doubles national
titles.
"John has been an integral part of our
tennis family for more than 40 years and we
have benefited from his accomplishments as
an NCAA champion student-athlete and
coach," athletic director Bernard Muir told
GoStanford. "We appreciate his service over
these past 10 years as our head coach and
wish him luck in this next chapter of life."
