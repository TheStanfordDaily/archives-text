## CANNES 2014 COMES TO A CLOSE IN THE MIDST OF MANY FILMS, ONLY A FEW STAND OUT 
### ALEXANDRA HEENEY MANAGING EDITOR 
After nine blissful days in the
French Riviera and about 24
films, I finished up my
Cannes Film Festival experi
ence exhausted and ready to
come back to California. The
festival wrapped last weekend, with

an awards ceremony doling out
prizes for the best films, performanc
es, directing and screenwriting. De
spite its relatively small selection of
films the festival plays host to
about 60 films throughout all of its
sections, compared to the 300+
films at the Toronto International
Film Festival there was still a wide
variety of films and styles from

around the world, although few that
I fell truly, madly, deeply in love with.
Although the ones I liked best didn't
win the top awards, which rarely
seem to go to the best films anyway
("Fahrenheit 9/11" once won the
Palme d'Or, after all), none of them
went home completely empty-hand
ed. Here's a look at some of the best
films and performances I saw at the

festival.
My favorite film of the festival
was the documentary "The Salt of
the Earth," about Brazilian photog
rapher Sebastiao Salgado, who
started out as an economist before
dedicating his life to photography,
making a name for himself by going
to the world's toughest places
Rwanda during the conflict, the poor
est parts of Ethiopia â€”to photo
graph people suffering. Directed by
Salgado's son, Juliano, and Palme
d'Or-winner Wim Wenders ("Paris,
Texas"), what this film was doing in
the Un Certain Regard sidebar, up
against new filmmakers whose work
mostly paled in comparison, is rather
unclear. But the Official Competition
has rarely played host to documen
taries.
Wenders is a long-time fan of
Salgado's work, and has a print of the
haunting "Blind Woman" sitting in
his office, which never fails to move
him to tears. Juliano spent most of his
childhood with an absent father, who
was off on adventures in the poorest
parts of the world. Together, they've
made a film that's a labor of love, as
compassionate towards its subject as
Salgado was towards those he pho
tographed so remarkably. In Ethiopi
an refugee camps in 1984, he pho
tographed bodies so emaciated they
look like skeletons; in Mali, he pho
tographed an emaciated eight-year
old boy in rags, walking away, with a
straight back and determination, in
spite of his seemingly hopeless situa
tion. On a recent shoot in Antarctica,
on which Juliano finally accompanied
his father, we watch them rolling
around on the beach, to unobtrusive
ly photograph a group of walruses.
The stories Salgado captured in his
photos are as fascinating as his own
story: a trailblazer, an adventurer and
above all, an empathetic artist. The
film deservedly won the Un Certain
Regard Special Prize.
The award for the film that was
simply the most fun to watch goes to
David Cronenberg's black comedy
"Maps to the Stars." It's getting

billed as a Hollywood satire, but it's
really a story of family drama, set in
LA, which happens to skewer the
film industry in the process. As a
place full of ambitious people, des
perate to be seen and full of insecuri

ties, Hollywood already offers a
heightened reality, where Cronen
berg can explore his interests in psy
cho-sexual issues, circumventing the
need to make a horror or Sci-Fi genre
film.
At the center of the film is a
young burn victim and schizo
phrenic, Agatha (Mia Wasikowska),
who comes back to LA to reunite
with her troubled family after years
in a mental institution. Along the
way, she meets an infantile, self-ab
sorbed actress, Havana (Julianne
Moore), who takes an interest in her
because her own mother (Sarah
Gadon), who still haunts her, died in
a fire. Havana frequents a bizarre
therapist (John Cusack) who is him
self a sort of celebrity, as well as the
father of a 13-year-old child actor,
Benjie (Evan Bird), recently returned
from rehab.

Brimming with witty one-liners
and smart observations about human
behavior, "Maps to the Stars" has
enough laughs to be a comedy, and
one of Cronenberg's most pleasura
ble films, but never sacrifices psycho
logical depth. The characters are all
connected in complicated ways, or
find ways to insinuate themselves
into each others lives as away to as
suage their own feelings of inadequa
cy, whether that's Havana trying to
make a move on Agatha's beau
(Robert Pattinson), or Benjie spiraling
out of control because of his family.
Julianne Moore, never one to
shy away from taking risks, whether
as a woman in a lesbian relationship
in Atom Egoyan's "Chloe," or a self
absorbed mother in "What Maisie
Knew," gives another ballsy and com
plex performance in "Maps to the

"There was still a wide
variety of films and
styles from around
the world, although
few that I fell truly,
madly in love with''
