# ON CAMPUS
## "CONSTRUCTION SITE" 
### JENNA SHAPIRO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Through a series of five site-specific
contemporary dance pieces devel
oped on five distinctive locations
around campus, the Dance Division's
"Construction Site" performance on
May 28 inspired a, quite literally, mov

ing experience for attendees. Beginning at
the Bing Concert Hall entrance and looping
around Harmony House to end at the Cantor
Arts Center, the audience was guided from
site to site by an enthusiastic, dancing
troupe of "construction workers" who
posed creatively to form the path. Although
marked by five separate pieces, the night
served as a cohesive reminder of Stanford's

transforming physical environment and art's
ability to awaken the senses.
Diane Frank, a visionary lecturer within
the Dance Division who originally conceived
the event, said, "I wanted to convey that the
entire campus has aesthetic potential, an
artistic potential, and that there is no one lo
cation or hierarchy of locations that are art
ful."
The dances, choreographed by Stan
ford's Diane Frank, Aleta Hayes and Robert
Moses as well as visiting Bay Area artists
Manuelito Biag and Nina Haft, were devel
oped as responses to their specific location.
Gloria Chua' 17, a member of the audi
ence, pointed out this site specificity as a key
element of her experience. She recalled,
"The dancers were in this particular loca
tion, this particular time and place."
The performance's strategic onset at 7
p.m., just before sunset, meant that time
would indeed have a significant role in the
show. The wide-windowed Bing Concert

Hall entrance invited light which, according
to Chua, was like "liquid" that enhanced the
fluidity of the dancers' movement; by the
time of Frank's concluding piece at Cantor,
artificial light would cast dancers' shadows
against large wooden sculptures and amplify
their movements.

The dancers, their unique settings and
the time of day all played a part in the overall
production. This natural relationship only
mirrored the overriding sense of collabora
tion that "Construction Site" required. De
spite the independent preparation by chore
ographers for each site, the pieces were
linked by the genre of contemporary dance,
as well as by the thoughtful transitions be
tween the pieces by the Construction Crew.
The Construction Crew, the troupe of guides
clad in white helmets, orange vests, and safe
ty tape, was in itself a combined effort of a di
verse assortment of people dancers, grad
uate students, staff people, students in the
ITALIC program, and Varsity athletes.
As Frank put it, "I like to crack open an
idea about what art is, and who does it."
Meredith Charlson ' 16, a Dance Minor
and member of the Chocolate Heads Move
ment Band, described her piece as a collabo
ration between the dancers and director,
Aleta Hayes. Hayes would let them "play" and
"see what was possible" on the Huang steps
in the Engineering Quad.
"One of my favorite things about ["Con
struction Site"] is the fact that we are re
hearsing on site," Charlson said. "I feel like
dance on campus is very contained, and
that's true of the arts generally. It was inter
esting to bring art and dance to space that
doesn't see it often."
Indeed, intrigued faces that had not
been traveling with the clumped audience
would stop in their path to take a look.
"Art is construction," Frank said. "We
"build things. [Art] is not an idea, it's an ac
tion. The entire campus is undergoing
tremendous renovation in terms of its physi
cal facilities... At the same time that the facil
ities are being constructed, we are also con
structing a frame of mind and point of view
about art thinking and performance on cam
pus."
Both the original audience, and the audi
ence that joined along the way, were able to
begin constructing this creative mindset and
"point of view" that sees artistic potential in
everyday sights and settings.
