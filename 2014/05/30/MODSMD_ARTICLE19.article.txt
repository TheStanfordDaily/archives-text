# ON CAMPUS
## "CONSTRUCTION SITE" 
### JENNA SHAPIRO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Through a series of five site-specific
contemporary dance pieces devel
oped on five distinctive locations
around campus, the Dance Division's
"Construction Site" performance on
May 28 inspired a, quite literally, mov

ing experience for attendees. Beginning at
the Bing Concert Hall entrance and looping
around Harmony House to end at the Cantor
Arts Center, the audience was guided from
site to site by an enthusiastic, dancing
troupe of "construction workers" who
posed creatively to form the path. Although
marked by five separate pieces, the night
served as a cohesive reminder of Stanford's

transforming physical environment and art's
ability to awaken the senses.
Diane Frank, a visionary lecturer within
the Dance Division who originally conceived
the event, said, "I wanted to convey that the
entire campus has aesthetic potential, an
artistic potential, and that there is no one lo
cation or hierarchy of locations that are art
ful."
The dances, choreographed by Stan
ford's Diane Frank, Aleta Hayes and Robert
Moses as well as visiting Bay Area artists
Manuelito Biag and Nina Haft, were devel
oped as responses to their specific location.
Gloria Chua' 17, a member of the audi
ence, pointed out this site specificity as a key
element of her experience. She recalled,
"The dancers were in this particular loca
tion, this particular time and place."
The performance's strategic onset at 7
p.m., just before sunset, meant that time
would indeed have a significant role in the
show. The wide-windowed Bing Concert
