## What's next for '14? CDC shares employment statistics and changes in job opportunities 
### LUCY SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
As the Class of 2014 prepares to leave
Stanford, many wonder where they will be
headed next. Based on the data from the
class of 2013, the Career Development
Center (CDC) projects that 40 percent of
the Class of 2014 will head into full-time
employment, 24 percent will continue on
into graduate or professional school and 21
percent will still be seeking employment.
Another seven percent of students fall
into the "not seeking employment or edu
cation" category, which Farouk Dey, the ex
ecutive director of the CDC, explained is
mainly students who take time off to travel.

He said that there are also some students
who "just take time off to figure out what
their next move is."
The remaining eight percent is attrib
uted to students with part-time employ
ment, volunteer positions, students enter
ing the military, those who are seeking con
tinuing education or are still undecided.
Farouk Dey explained that while the
percentage of unemployed students will
likely decrease by June (the data is taken in
March), there are reasons why some stu
dents face more difficulty landing jobs than
others.
"The number one reason is not start
ing the process early enough," he said.
"That's the number one mistake that stu

dents make, and that they delay the process
until spring quarter."
One common misconception among
students is that their choice in major will af
fect their competitiveness in the job mar
ket. Dey stressed, however, that majors
very rarely matter.

"Employers don't discriminate by
major, they discriminate by skill level and
enthusiasm and potential," he said. "I have
not seen a problem with specific majors.
It's easy to go there with stereotypes, but
that's not what I've found."

Dey explained that students who enter
senior year with internship experience,
however, often have a leg up in finding
employment.
"Students with internships tend to
engage in the process early and tend to
have connected with careers and within
a network much earlier," he said. "They
tend to get those offers in hand really
early."
Based on the 2013 data, the CDC
found that the top fields that Stanford
graduates go into are technology (17
percent), consulting (12 percent), fi
nancial services (10 percent) and edu
cation (10 percent). Further, the top
five employers for Stanford students
are Stanford University, Google, Mor
gan Stanley, Teach for America and Ac
centure.
Dey stressed that the most popular

fields will likely change in the coming
years, however, as the CDC changes its
structure.
"Students tend to go to into these
sectors [consulting, computer science,
finance] because of their interests...
but also sometimes because those are
the opportunities that come their way,"
he said. "We recognize at the career
center that there are underrepresented
fields in the career centers in terms of
job postings and representation."
The CDC will be hiring industry ex
perts in several new areas in an effort to
connect more students, including a ca
reer consultant for social impact careers.
"We are currently redesigning our
program in order to meet these de
mands," he said. "Within a couple of
years you should see different num
bers."
