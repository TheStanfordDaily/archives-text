## French Cassettes 
### GABRIELA GROTH 
A youthful, bright aesthetic, a sound
that makes you yearn for summer
and the ability to get a crowd
dancing with just a few riffs of
their catchy tunes have garnered
the French Cassettes a loyal local
following in the Bay Area. We spoke with
lead singer Scott Huerta about the band's
writing process, the changing music indus
try and his love for the San Francisco music
scene. Check these guys out at the Local
Band Stage at Live 105's annual BFD music
festival on June 1.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What
genre do you consider your music to be?
Scott Huerta (SH): I usually just de
scribe it as danceable indie pop. We defi
nitely put a lot of focus on the drumbeats.
We like movement in our songs, so we usu
ally just say danceable indie rock.
TSD: Who writes the songs, and what
is your writing process?
SH: It's usually me or Mac (guitar)
who brings the song to the table, and then
we'll let everyone write their own parts.
We've even had songs where I'll write the
verse, and then Mac writes the chorus.
We've always just really gotten along that
way. We all sit around and write our own
parts basically. The last thing we wite is the
lyrics, actually. I usually do the melody first
and then write the lyrics.
TSD: How do you come up with lyrics?
SH: I usually go for a walk. That's
where I get my best writing done. Singing
the melody, I just start to sing gibberish
words, whatever comes to my head. It usu
ally means nothing at all, and so if you listen
to early demos, I'm just saying nonsense.
Sometimes I find something that I blurted
out kind of intriguing, and then I base it off
of that.
TSD: You currently have one full length
album, how did that start out? Do you come
up with songs and place them into an album,
or do you have an idea for the arc of an
album and fill it in with songs?
SH: I think we do it the way most bands
do it where there's just one song that will
get you pumped about writing more songs,

and that's the beginning of the album. For us
that was "Us Kids" off of "Gold Youth." We
just came together so well that we just set a
goal. We wanted to have at least this many
songs and no more than this many songs,
which is kind of nerdy just like wanting a
specific number, but that's just how we
worked it out.

TSD: Are most of your songs a result of
sitting down and deciding to write a song, or
does inspiration for a song come when you're
just playing around?
SH: I've written multiple songs just
from being at my house and thinkjing] about
what I want to do that day. I think I want to
write a song, and so I sit down long enough
until I have something that I like. And I
would say almost 90 percent of the time we
end up using it. I have to be pushed like that.
I don't wait for inspiration because I might
be waiting forever.
TSD: Who and what were your inspira
tions in your last album?
SH: I was inspired by bits and pieces of
songs rather than just full bands. There was a
chord change I liked in one of [The Dirty Pro
jectors'] songs, and there was a drumbeat I
liked from a band that I saw in San Francisco.
I just hear something, and I get inspired and
want to write something around that.

TSD: How has your music changed since
you started playing?
SH: We decided to stop trying to write
songs a certain way or to be cool. If you listen
to our old songs on EPs that we don't even
allow to be on the internet... we tried really
hard to sound like certain bands. This time we
wanted to drop all of that and write songs that
we really enjoyed for ourselves. So something
that has changed the most is that we've be
come more comfortable and confident in our
songwriting. When you're not big at all, and
people don't know about you, you just look at
bands that people like and [think] "if people like
that, we'll just do that." It's definitely changed
now that we've got a backing and a following.
We feel comfortable writing songs that maybe
don't sound like the bands they like.

lead singer Scott Huerta about the band's
writing process, the changing music indus
try and his love for the San Francisco music
scene. Check these guys out at the Local
Band Stage at Live 105's annual BFD music
festival on June 1.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What
genre do you consider your music to be?
Scott Huerta (SH): I usually just de
scribe it as danceable indie pop. We defi
nitely put a lot of focus on the drumbeats.
We like movement in our songs, so we usu
ally just say danceable indie rock.
TSD: Who writes the songs, and what
is your writing process?
SH: It's usually me or Mac (guitar)
who brings the song to the table, and then
we'll let everyone write their own parts.
We've even had songs where I'll write the
verse, and then Mac writes the chorus.
We've always just really gotten along that
way. We all sit around and write our own
parts basically. The last thing we wite is the
lyrics, actually. I usually do the melody first
and then write the lyrics.
TSD: How do you come up with lyrics?
SH: I usually go for a walk. That's
where I get my best writing done. Singing
the melody, I just start to sing gibberish
words, whatever comes to my head. It usu
ally means nothing at all, and so if you listen
to early demos, I'm just saying nonsense.
Sometimes I find something that I blurted
out kind of intriguing, and then I base it off
of that.
TSD: You currently have one full length
album, how did that start out? Do you come
up with songs and place them into an album,
or do you have an idea for the arc of an
album and fill it in with songs?
SH: I think we do it the way most bands
do it where there's just one song that will
get you pumped about writing more songs,

and that's the beginning of the album. For us
that was "Us Kids" off of "Gold Youth." We
just came together so well that we just set a
goal. We wanted to have at least this many
songs and no more than this many songs,
which is kind of nerdy just like wanting a
specific number, but that's just how we
worked it out.

TSD: Are most of your songs a result of
sitting down and deciding to write a song, or
does inspiration for a song come when you're
just playing around?
SH: I've written multiple songs just
from being at my house and thinkjing] about
what I want to do that day. I think I want to
write a song, and so I sit down long enough
until I have something that I like. And I
would say almost 90 percent of the time we
end up using it. I have to be pushed like that.
I don't wait for inspiration because I might
be waiting forever.
TSD: Who and what were your inspira
tions in your last album?
SH: I was inspired by bits and pieces of
songs rather than just full bands. There was a
chord change I liked in one of [The Dirty Pro
jectors'] songs, and there was a drumbeat I
liked from a band that I saw in San Francisco.
I just hear something, and I get inspired and
want to write something around that.

TSD: How has your music changed since
you started playing?
SH: We decided to stop trying to write
songs a certain way or to be cool. If you listen
to our old songs on EPs that we don't even
allow to be on the internet... we tried really
hard to sound like certain bands. This time we
wanted to drop all of that and write songs that
we really enjoyed for ourselves. So something
that has changed the most is that we've be
come more comfortable and confident in our
songwriting. When you're not big at all, and
people don't know about you, you just look at
bands that people like and [think] "if people like
that, we'll just do that." It's definitely changed
now that we've got a backing and a following.
We feel comfortable writing songs that maybe
don't sound like the bands they like.
