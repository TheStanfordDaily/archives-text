## French Cassettes 
### GABRIELA GROTH 
A youthful, bright aesthetic, a sound
that makes you yearn for summer
and the ability to get a crowd
dancing with just a few riffs of
their catchy tunes have garnered
the French Cassettes a loyal local
following in the Bay Area. We spoke with
lead singer Scott Huerta about the band's
writing process, the changing music indus
try and his love for the San Francisco music
scene. Check these guys out at the Local
Band Stage at Live 105's annual BFD music
festival on June 1.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What
genre do you consider your music to be?
Scott Huerta (SH): I usually just de
scribe it as danceable indie pop. We defi
nitely put a lot of focus on the drumbeats.
We like movement in our songs, so we usu
ally just say danceable indie rock.
TSD: Who writes the songs, and what
is your writing process?
SH: It's usually me or Mac (guitar)
who brings the song to the table, and then
we'll let everyone write their own parts.
We've even had songs where I'll write the
verse, and then Mac writes the chorus.
We've always just really gotten along that
way. We all sit around and write our own
parts basically. The last thing we wite is the
lyrics, actually. I usually do the melody first
and then write the lyrics.
TSD: How do you come up with lyrics?
SH: I usually go for a walk. That's
where I get my best writing done. Singing
the melody, I just start to sing gibberish
words, whatever comes to my head. It usu
ally means nothing at all, and so if you listen
to early demos, I'm just saying nonsense.
Sometimes I find something that I blurted
out kind of intriguing, and then I base it off
of that.
