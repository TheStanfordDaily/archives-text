# VISUAL ARTS
## The 						Art of Science 
### DEWITT CHENG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Casual visitors to the David W. Packard
Electrical Engineering Building last Friday af
ternoon had there been any, on the first
day of a long weekend might have won
dered about the art exhibition displayed on a
forest of small easels. This was no regular art
exhibition, but" Art of Science," (AoS) a pop
ular show, now in its third year, organized by
the Stanford Materials Research Society. AoS
challenges Stanford faculty, staff and students
to "show their work" or, rather artwork,
with a scientific angle, in no uncertain terms:
"Science is boring. Art is stupid. PROVE US
WRONG!"
This year's4s works were drawn from the
disciplines of Materials Science, Psychiatry,
Physics, Bioengineering, Mechanical Engineer
ing, Chemistry, Electrical Engineering, Medi
cine, Radiology, Earth Systems, Computer Sci
ence and Geological and Environmental Sci
ence, as well as the fields of English, Dance and
Art /Art History.
The exhibition organizer, materials sci
ence doctoral student Ashwin Atre, said in a re
cent interview, "I think that all of these people
who are submitting really enjoy the aesthetic
side of what they do scientifically, and so it's a
nice way of celebrate that together." Atre
brought the idea from his undergrad alma
mater, Princeton, which started a competition
in 2005, and the Materials Research Society re
ceives a small amount of funding from various
organizations. In previous years, AoS was con
fined to science and engineering departments.
This year, hoping to develop and further estab
lish the event, Atre opened it up to the entire
university: "I emailed every dean that I could
find an email for," he says.
Awards this year went to depictions of a
section of mouse hippocampus by psychiatry

professor Ahmad Salehi; a bit of overloaded
Transmission Electron Microscopy grid by grad
uate students Michelle Davidson and Mathias
Voges; and a Foldscope, or simple microscope,
photo of a peacock wing by Marina Dimitrov
' 17. People's Choice awards, tallied on an iPad,
went to a color interference microscope photo
graph of a film of a teardrop settling onto a con
tact lens by graduate student Saad Bhamla; and
an altered 19th-century anatomical engraving
by medical student Michael Nedelman.
Honorable Mentions went to an ultrasonic
video of the heat-wave turbulence, otherwise
invisible, generated by a wooden-match flame,
by graduate students Victor Miller and Matt
Tilghman; and the wavelike interference pat
tern displayed by phthalocyanine molecules
sent through a nanofabricated grating, cap

tured by fluorescence microscope, by postdoc
toral researcher Thomas Juffman. This writer
was fascinated as well by the PCBM ("a solubi
lized fullerene derivative") crystals on a solar
cell by graduate student Jonathan Bartelt; and
the Soap Film Tunnel vortices under orange
yellow sodium-vapor light by postdoctoral re
searcher H. Dogus Akaydin.
If the high-tech sources of these striking
abstract images strike some of us as comically
esoteric, some of the artist-scientists admitted
ly have fun, too, employing slang and other un
professional colloquialisms in their titles.
"Chlorella in Living Color," "Spiral Out
Keep Going!" "Bureau of Longitudes," "Orien
tal Landscape Painting: Nano-Valley," "Waitless
Potential," "Down the Drain," "The A-Team,"
"Of Cows and Men" and "The Ride of the

Vaucheria" are a few examples of through-the
looking-glass absurdist wit. Two pieces are
clearly humorous or satirical in intent: Cristina
Zavaleta's "The Father of Radiology and His
Legacy" and Shawn Lin's and Isabella Lai's "A
Modern Medical Education."
While the great majority of the art on dis
play took the form of photography (all 16" x
20"), traditional paintings and mixed-media
works were shown as well, along with a half
dozen or so computer/video works. Creative
nerds interested in participating in AoS 2015
will soon find images of all the 2014 artworks

sent through a nanofabricated grating, cap

tured by fluorescence microscope, by postdoc
toral researcher Thomas Juffman. This writer
was fascinated as well by the PCBM ("a solubi
lized fullerene derivative") crystals on a solar
cell by graduate student Jonathan Bartelt; and
the Soap Film Tunnel vortices under orange
yellow sodium-vapor light by postdoctoral re
searcher H. Dogus Akaydin.
If the high-tech sources of these striking
abstract images strike some of us as comically
esoteric, some of the artist-scientists admitted
ly have fun, too, employing slang and other un
professional colloquialisms in their titles.
"Chlorella in Living Color," "Spiral Out
Keep Going!" "Bureau of Longitudes," "Orien
tal Landscape Painting: Nano-Valley," "Waitless
Potential," "Down the Drain," "The A-Team,"
"Of Cows and Men" and "The Ride of the

Vaucheria" are a few examples of through-the
looking-glass absurdist wit. Two pieces are
clearly humorous or satirical in intent: Cristina
Zavaleta's "The Father of Radiology and His
Legacy" and Shawn Lin's and Isabella Lai's "A
Modern Medical Education."
While the great majority of the art on dis
play took the form of photography (all 16" x
20"), traditional paintings and mixed-media
works were shown as well, along with a half
dozen or so computer/video works. Creative
nerds interested in participating in AoS 2015
will soon find images of all the 2014 artworks
