### DEWITT CHENG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Michael Bartalos, Galen Jackson,
Eleanor Oakes, Ben Peterson and Anja
Ulfeldt are showing multimedia, cross-dis
ciplinary work in "Half Tilt Full Lean," an
exhibition running through June 15 at the
Thomas Welton Stanford Art Gallery, near
the northeast corner of the Quad.
The work is conceptual and intellectu
al, but also humorous and socio-politically
driven. The statement by the show's cura
tor, Stanford Art Professor Enrique
Chagoya, entitled "Ontology of the Sublime
(What the ... ?)," sets the tone, with a philo
sophical dialogue between Sublime and

Ontology that is clearly modeled on Oscar
Wilde's cleverly paradoxical model. Sub
lime claims, for example, that art is not lim
ited to "the thingly thingness of the thing,"
adding, "Also I am not sure one can say that
there is a beingness in art." But fear not:
Chagoya's insights into his students' works,
expressed in his "humble clear, precise,
concise and profound style," are informa
tive, even when read onscreen.
Bartalos's "Phase Transition" is a sculp
tural installation featuring long strips of sil
very Mylar tape, draped from nails in loops
and swags that may suggest audiocassette
tape or film projectors. Illuminated by the
atrical red, blue and green lamps, the loops
create multicolored auroral reflections that

are hypnotically beautiful, though charged
with subtext: the tape replicates a 1450-
year graph depicting Arctic ice levels, end
ing with "the Mylar's final and precipitous
drop to the floor." Bartalos sees this piece as
representing our and nature's "perpetual
state of vulnerability and transformation."
Jackson's three untitled installations
are enigmatic stage sets that suggest diora
mas or museum theme rooms, but he paro
dies instead of commemorating nerd-ge
nius scientific research in a capitalist econ
omy issues that are certainly au courant
on the Farm. The artist recruits products of
outmoded technology for his absurdist
