## "Half Tilt Full Lean" at Welton Gallery 
### DEWITT CHENG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Michael Bartalos, Galen Jackson,
Eleanor Oakes, Ben Peterson and Anja
Ulfeldt are showing multimedia, cross-dis
ciplinary work in "Half Tilt Full Lean," an
exhibition running through June 15 at the
Thomas Welton Stanford Art Gallery, near
the northeast corner of the Quad.
The work is conceptual and intellectu
al, but also humorous and socio-politically
driven. The statement by the show's cura
tor, Stanford Art Professor Enrique
Chagoya, entitled "Ontology of the Sublime
(What the ... ?)," sets the tone, with a philo
sophical dialogue between Sublime and

Ontology that is clearly modeled on Oscar
Wilde's cleverly paradoxical model. Sub
lime claims, for example, that art is not lim
ited to "the thingly thingness of the thing,"
adding, "Also I am not sure one can say that
there is a beingness in art." But fear not:
Chagoya's insights into his students' works,
expressed in his "humble clear, precise,
concise and profound style," are informa
tive, even when read onscreen.
Bartalos's "Phase Transition" is a sculp
tural installation featuring long strips of sil
very Mylar tape, draped from nails in loops
and swags that may suggest audiocassette
tape or film projectors. Illuminated by the
atrical red, blue and green lamps, the loops
create multicolored auroral reflections that

are hypnotically beautiful, though charged
with subtext: the tape replicates a 1450-
year graph depicting Arctic ice levels, end
ing with "the Mylar's final and precipitous
drop to the floor." Bartalos sees this piece as
representing our and nature's "perpetual
state of vulnerability and transformation."
Jackson's three untitled installations
are enigmatic stage sets that suggest diora
mas or museum theme rooms, but he paro
dies instead of commemorating nerd-ge
nius scientific research in a capitalist econ
omy issues that are certainly au courant
on the Farm. The artist recruits products of
outmoded technology for his absurdist
"narrative-centric art cinema," including 50-
gallon oil drums marked "lityum dirt and efflu
ents," tangles of extruded VHS tape, photo
graphs and phonographs, slide carousels,
game controllers, scrolls of bubble wrap, suit
cases, thrift-store easy chairs, stacks of boxy
CRT monitors and cartons of "lithuril lityum
karbonat" capsules.
Oakes' video diptych, "Barnes Hall,
2012-14" (presumably referring to a Cornell
dorm) comprises two angled video screens
presenting slightly different, slowly changing
views of what appears to be the night sky,
filled with stars and cosmic dust. The size and
ambiguous subject matter suggest Abstract
Expressionist painting, but a more relevant
artistic antecedent might be "Dust Breeding,"
Man Ray's famous 1920 photograph of Mar
cel Duchamp's Large Glass after a year in stor
age. Oakes takes the "dead cells and strands of
hair" that go trailing behind us every day and
makes animated "dustograms" in the dark
room, poetic bridges, says Chagoya, "between
the micro-cosmic and the infinite."
Peterson's nine painted ceramic sculp
tures from the "Cynics" series resemble small

blocky maquettes for monumental abstract
sculptures, but also suggest Brutalist concrete
architecture, Ikea-style Modernist furniture
and, with their oddly placed cavities, the übiq
uitous styrofoam packing materials protecting
consumer goods.
Ulfeldt's sculptures with sound derive
from her experience living in industrial parts
of the Bay Area and her interests in ambient
noise and temporality: "I want my installa
tions to exist in their own perpetual moment,
creating a collective durational experience
while remaining urgently present." "Street
Lamp" pairs a yellow sodium-bulb streetlight,
centered beneath the gallery lobby's dome,
with streaming traffic sounds from Oakland.
"Domestic Infrastructure #2," composed of a
network of recycled cast-iron pipes mounted
to the wall, resembles a flow diagram, and
functions as such when viewers manually
pump water to the top, causing the rust-dis
colored fluid, with its sound amplified, to gur
gle and rush downward, staining the walls.

presenting slightly different, slowly changing
views of what appears to be the night sky,
filled with stars and cosmic dust. The size and
ambiguous subject matter suggest Abstract
Expressionist painting, but a more relevant
artistic antecedent might be "Dust Breeding,"
Man Ray's famous 1920 photograph of Mar
cel Duchamp's Large Glass after a year in stor
age. Oakes takes the "dead cells and strands of
hair" that go trailing behind us every day and
makes animated "dustograms" in the dark
room, poetic bridges, says Chagoya, "between
the micro-cosmic and the infinite."
Peterson's nine painted ceramic sculp
tures from the "Cynics" series resemble small

blocky maquettes for monumental abstract
sculptures, but also suggest Brutalist concrete
architecture, Ikea-style Modernist furniture
and, with their oddly placed cavities, the übiq
uitous styrofoam packing materials protecting
consumer goods.
Ulfeldt's sculptures with sound derive
from her experience living in industrial parts
of the Bay Area and her interests in ambient
noise and temporality: "I want my installa
tions to exist in their own perpetual moment,
creating a collective durational experience
while remaining urgently present." "Street
Lamp" pairs a yellow sodium-bulb streetlight,
centered beneath the gallery lobby's dome,
with streaming traffic sounds from Oakland.
"Domestic Infrastructure #2," composed of a
network of recycled cast-iron pipes mounted
to the wall, resembles a flow diagram, and
functions as such when viewers manually
pump water to the top, causing the rust-dis
colored fluid, with its sound amplified, to gur
gle and rush downward, staining the walls.
