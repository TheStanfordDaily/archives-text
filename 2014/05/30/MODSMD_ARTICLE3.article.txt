## Senior Gift campaign begins 
### SHUBHA RAGHVENDRA 
As the 2013-2014 school year draws
to a close, Stanford seniors are confronted
with the question of what it means to be
an alumnus. Central to this new identity is
the question of how alumni will give back
to their alma mater. Although some under
graduates may see donation requests as a
nuisance, the efforts of a small team of stu
dents and staff have aimed to recast young
alumni giving as a gesture of gratitude
through the Senior Gift.
The Senior Gift committee, co
chaired by 12 seniors, released its promo
tional video this past Tuesday, May 27, sig
naling the reinvigoration of fundraising ef
forts into the beginning of June.
"Last year, over 86 percent of seniors
made a Senior Gift," said Felicity Meu,
Senior Associate Director of the Stanford

Fund. Meu, who specializes in student
and young alumni development, empha
sized that office's goal of increasing partic
ipation this year.
Dan Ashton'l4, a co-chair of the Sen
ior Gift committee, expressed confidence
that this target would be hit by the close of
his senior year.
"Currently, between 60 and 70 per
cent of our class has donated to Senior
Gift," he said.
Ashton explained that stakes are par
ticularly high this year as far as recruiting
more donors.
"The Bing family has promised an
extra $25,000 contribution if we can get
to 75 percent before early June," he said.
Senior Gift contributions are already
matched 3:1 by various donors.
Both Ashton and fellow co-chair Billy
Gallagher'l4 described diverse approach

es to encouraging seniors to give to Senior
Gift. Aside from employing social media
and email messages, the committee held a
wine tasting in Frost Amphitheater and has
hosted giveaways and other fundraising
events in addition to personal outreach ef
forts.
Many of the funds donated to the
Senior Gift go toward financial aid, some
thing both emphasized as a key reason to
donate.
Ashton noted that he feels a special
connection to the mission of Senior Gift,
"given that I'm on a large amount of finan
cial aid myself."
Both Gallagher and Ashton acknowl
edged the mentorship and hard work of
Meu's office and the guidance of Nora
Martin 'l2, assistant director of student
