## Gates divestment demanded 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
Following the announcement of
Bill and Melinda Gates as Com
mencement speakers for the upcom
ing Class of 2014 graduation this
year, students began forming a move
ment requesting the Gates Founda
tion to divest from company G4S. As
of yesterday, 1100 people had signed
a petition calling for divestment due
to a "litany of human rights abuse
and concerns" that the statement
claimed G4S was complicit in.
On Wednesday, a stock ex
change filing showed that Gates had
sold down his stake in G4S to below
three percent. It is unclear exactly
how much stock Gates still holds be
cause three percent is the lowest
threshold at which investors must
declar.
The student group organizing
the protest released a statement ap
plauding Gates' decision to sell down
his shares.
"We have been in direct com
munication with representatives of
the Foundation and indirect contact
with representatives of the Asset
Trust that runs the foundation's en
dowment since May 13 and as re-

cently as May 28," the press release
stated. "We view Gates' decision as a
victory for our campaign and the
many others around the globe that
have been working tirelessly against
G4S' human rights abuses and the
Gates Foundation's investments in
them."

According to Clayton Evans 'l5,
another student organizer, there are
about 40 active members in the coali
tion, which officially began its push
for student mobiliztion of the cam
pus about a month ago. The student
coalition also includes representa
tives from a wide array of student
groups including Fossil Free Stan
ford, the Student Labor Alliance, the
Stanford Asian American Activism
Committee, Stanford STAND and
Students for Justice in Palestine.

"[G4S] is involved in a huge
plethora and wide array of human
rights abuses in almost every geopo
litical and social context in Central
America, the Middle East and South
Africa," said Joshua Schott 'l4, stu
dent organizer. "In having the Gates
Foundation invested in a corporation
that does all these things that kills
and marginalizes the communities
that the Gates Foundation tries to
help is somewhat hypocritical and

contradictory to what they're
doing."

"It's not about being against the
Gates, it's about trying to make the
Gates Foundation hold true to its
principle because it does so much
good and is an amazing entity," Evans
said.

In its press release following the
divestment, the Stanford campaign
said that it would continue to call for
broader action than selling shares
from G4S. The group said that it is
still asking for the Gates Foundation
and its Asset Trust to complete divest
from G4S, reevaluate its investments
in companies under investigation for
human rights abuses and to publicize
its policy of socially responsible in
vestment.

"Having the Gates Foundation
[completely] divest from [G4S] is the
ultimate goal but we're realistic and

know that there's a slim chance from
doing that, but we want a public en
gagement around these issues,"
Schott said. "And so this would be re
ally crucial, and I think we've already

succeeded a lot of ways in sparking
discussion on campus."
