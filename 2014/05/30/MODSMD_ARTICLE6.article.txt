## 
### 
The students calling for the Gates
Foundation to withdraw its $ 172 mil
lion investment from G4S, the largest
private military and security company
in the world, have made several key
claims. On the students' website, the
concerns about G4S are listed as fol
lows:
■ Privatizing juvenile detention facili
ties in the United States and oper
ating over 100 vehicles that bring
captured undocumented immi
grants to detention centers on the
US/Mexico border.
■ Failing to properly house asylum
seekers in UK detention centers,
killing Jimmy Mubenga while at
tempting to deport him to Angola,
and killing 15-year-old Gareth
Myatt while restraining him at a
youth detention center.
■ Operating prisons, detention and
interrogation centers in Israel and
the Occupied Palestine, which hold
over 5,000 political prisoners, 173
children, and 180 people in indefi
nite detainment. In one case, Arafat
Jaradat died from torture in a G4S

secured detention center in 2013.
■ Operating the world's second
largest private prison in South
Africa, which is currently under in
vestigation for using forced injec
tions and shock therapy to subdue
inmates.
■ Violating international labor codes
by paying substandard wages and
using racist language and policies
against employees in Malawi,
Mozambique, and South Africa,
where University of Cape Town stu
dents are campaigning to remove
the company as the university's se
curity contractor for its mistreat
ment of workers.
