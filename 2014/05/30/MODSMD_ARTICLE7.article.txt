## Op-Ed The
						theory of Stanford: a senior reflection 
### Wyatt Hong 
As I prepare to leave Stanford, I
have begun to make a mental
recording of all that I see, as a
sailor in the pre-photographic age
might have stared at the objects in his
room one last time before he em
barked on a voyage that may take half
his life. And under that light of dawn,
where every object reveals its true
form, I see that my time here has been
utterly different from my childhood in
Korea, my boarding school years in
New England and my two years of mil
itary service back in Korea after my
freshman year a difference
marked not by uniqueness, for no
hour is experienced twice, but by its
unparalleled beauty.
Part of Stanford's beauty has to do
with personal history —the events
that took place and the people I met
here —a product of nostalgia that can
clothe the most mundane coinci
dences with the garments of fate. How
ever, much of it has to do with a kind of
beauty that does not need interpreta
tion, an a priori perfection self-evident
even to the rabbits in Lake Lag.
When I sit on the ledge of the
fountain by the west entrance of
Green Library and watch the sunset
brim over the arches of the Main
Quad, themselves framed by a sky
reminiscent of a Rothko painting, I
feel as if the heavens were made for
me. It seems inconceivable that any
thing bad should happen in this world.
For a moment, I feel invulnerable.
I know that this is an illusion. If my
military service in the Republic of
Korea Army during my two years of
leave from Stanford taught me any
thing, it was the fact that a human
being in essence is no different from a

dog that children can drown for play.
Within the first few days of boot camp,
I realized that my former sense of iden
tity was largely based on my social sta
tus, stripped of which I was a mass of
bone and muscle that required a
threshold amount of heat and food to
survive. This was a very different defi
nition of humanity from the one I had
developed through my education at
boarding school and Stanford and came
as a great shock to me. But what was
more surprising was that one got used
to these conditions and survived on the
stale biscuits the army gave out be
tween brainwashing sessions where
we were trained to kill North Koreans.
Some did not survive. On March
26, 2010, 46 soldiers drowned with
their ship that was hit by a North Ko
rean torpedo. In November 23 of the
same year two marines were killed by
artillery shelling of an island off the
western coast of Korea. I had been se
lected to be an interpreter after basic
infantry training and spent the rest of
my service behind a computer in the
headquarters of U.S. Forces Korea, at
the center of Seoul. My chances of
dying in combat were practically zero.
But attending funerals of soldiers my
age and witnessing man's helpless
ness at the cruelty of chance have
since instilled inside me a perennial
recognition of death that is like a fre
quency between silence and screech
that only certain animals can hear.

I hear it even as I write this in a
light-flooded room with the smell of
cut grass in the air. Last month, a cruis
er capsized off the southern coast of
Korea with 475 passengers on board,
