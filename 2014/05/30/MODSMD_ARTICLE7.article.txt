## Op-Ed The 						theory of Stanford: a senior reflection 
### Wyatt Hong 
As I prepare to leave Stanford, I
have begun to make a mental
recording of all that I see, as a
sailor in the pre-photographic age
might have stared at the objects in his
room one last time before he em
barked on a voyage that may take half
his life. And under that light of dawn,
where every object reveals its true
form, I see that my time here has been
utterly different from my childhood in
Korea, my boarding school years in
New England and my two years of mil
itary service back in Korea after my
freshman year a difference
marked not by uniqueness, for no
hour is experienced twice, but by its
unparalleled beauty.
Part of Stanford's beauty has to do
with personal history —the events
that took place and the people I met
here —a product of nostalgia that can
clothe the most mundane coinci
dences with the garments of fate. How
ever, much of it has to do with a kind of
beauty that does not need interpreta
tion, an a priori perfection self-evident
even to the rabbits in Lake Lag.
When I sit on the ledge of the
fountain by the west entrance of
Green Library and watch the sunset
brim over the arches of the Main
Quad, themselves framed by a sky
reminiscent of a Rothko painting, I
feel as if the heavens were made for
me. It seems inconceivable that any
thing bad should happen in this world.
For a moment, I feel invulnerable.
I know that this is an illusion. If my
military service in the Republic of
Korea Army during my two years of
leave from Stanford taught me any
thing, it was the fact that a human
being in essence is no different from a

dog that children can drown for play.
Within the first few days of boot camp,
I realized that my former sense of iden
tity was largely based on my social sta
tus, stripped of which I was a mass of
bone and muscle that required a
threshold amount of heat and food to
survive. This was a very different defi
nition of humanity from the one I had
developed through my education at
boarding school and Stanford and came
as a great shock to me. But what was
more surprising was that one got used
to these conditions and survived on the
stale biscuits the army gave out be
tween brainwashing sessions where
we were trained to kill North Koreans.
Some did not survive. On March
26, 2010, 46 soldiers drowned with
their ship that was hit by a North Ko
rean torpedo. In November 23 of the
same year two marines were killed by
artillery shelling of an island off the
western coast of Korea. I had been se
lected to be an interpreter after basic
infantry training and spent the rest of
my service behind a computer in the
headquarters of U.S. Forces Korea, at
the center of Seoul. My chances of
dying in combat were practically zero.
But attending funerals of soldiers my
age and witnessing man's helpless
ness at the cruelty of chance have
since instilled inside me a perennial
recognition of death that is like a fre
quency between silence and screech
that only certain animals can hear.

I hear it even as I write this in a
light-flooded room with the smell of
cut grass in the air. Last month, a cruis
er capsized off the southern coast of
Korea with 475 passengers on board,
325 of whom were high school students on a
school trip. The captain and the crew left the
ship without giving orders to escape, and most
passengers remained in their cabins, as they
were told when the ship started tilting. At the
moment of my writing, 282 have been con
firmed dead and 22 bodies are still missing.
Videos recorded on the students' phones of
their last hours inside the ship have been recov
ered from their corpses and released by the
media, but I don't have the heart to watch them.
I pause writing and try holding my breath as long
as possible. The pain of suffocation is beyond my
imagination.

The degree of empowerment one receives
at Stanford is almost superhuman. Sometimes,
looking at the night sky from the Oval after a run,
I feel like I will outlast the stars. Surely, part of the
sense of invulnerability has to do withyouth itself.
But it also has to do with what Stanford strives to
teach us day by day: that the world is ours to
change and that we have the power to change it.
However, when faced with events such as the re
cent calamity in Korea, I find it difficult to recon
cile Stanford with the rest of the world.
Stanford is not an accurate model of the
world. Things that we take for granted here
and I don't mean the weather, but rather basic
conditions of life such as freedom from fear
are absent in the vast majority of the world. Hav
ing left Stanford, we will find that the knowl
edge of justice does not make us immune to in
justice. We will be victimized by chance as much
as others. The talk about designing one's life will
not help us against a tsunami or a brain tumor,
whose form life takes far more often than a
closed system where friction and air resistance
are assumed to not exist.
Then what is the gift I take from Stanford if
not the preparation for life after Stanford?
I have come to believe that the purpose of
higher education is not to prepare one for life
but rather to showwhat life can be. As an inter
national student, my education in America as a

whole has been a process of learning what hu
manity is capable of in abundance and freedom.
Despite what some may think, America is a par
adise compared to most of the world, and out of
the vast expanse of her 50 states, Stanford may
be her epitome.
During my time here, as I witnessed Nobel
worthy discoveries like optogenetics, mile
stones in gender equality and construction of
wonders like the BingPerformingArts Center, in
the back of my mind there was a constant recog
nition of what I was seeing as a theory that must
be tested outside the gates of Stanford. As grad
uation approaches, the sheer brilliance of this
place seems almost unreal.
Some of us may choose never to leave Stan
ford. In fact, a significant percentage of alumni
choose to remain in the Bay Area. That is your
own decision to make. But to mistake the theory
of Stanford for reality without testing it will only
validate the criticism that higher education fos
ters an elitism that isolates one from the rest of
the world. You might say that you do not want to
have to do anything with the rest of the world.
But you already know, from the one time you
were able to bring happiness to another person's
life, that the gift of life cannot be received in iso
lation, that the most profound experiences of
our lives are those experienced in the plural
though we enter and leave this world alone.

I, too, do not know what life holds for me.
But to enable others to experience the beauty
that I experienced here, to bring the theory of
Stanford into reality in places without light or
warmth that is my goal, and that sense of
purpose is the gift that I take from Stanford. Take
a moment to appreciate the blessing that is your
life right now. life after Stanford will be difficult.
But you will remember what happened here
during these years. Also, what you know to be
true. What you know is possible.
