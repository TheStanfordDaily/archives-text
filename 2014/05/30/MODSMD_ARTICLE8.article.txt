## Obama's speech at West Point and the future of U.S. foreign policy 
### Norman Naimark 
This is an interview conducted over email
with Norman Naimark. This interview is
part of The Daily's "Ideas of an Interna
tional Order" series, running from April
27-30, 2014, which explores the poten
tialfor evolving and contrasting concepts
of an international system in the2lstcen
tury, and what America can or should do
in response.
What did we learn from President
Obama's speech at West Point?
The overwhelming impression
one gets from reading President
Obama's speech at West Point is its po
litical character. He responded to crit
icisms from those in the Republican
Party and even some politicians within
his own party who want the United
States to carry out a more activist for
eign (and military) policy. They consid
er the administration's actions in the
Syrian crisis and in Ukraine to be ex
cessively cautious, exacerbating
rather than helping to solve the prob
lems involved.
Obama also responded in parts of
his speech to the isolationist inclina
tions of the "Tea Party" movement
and, indeed, of a large segment of the
American people as a whole. He tried
to steer a moderate and middle course
in foreign policy, urging action only in
those cases of immediate American
interest, but calling for multi-lateral
action in less pressing cases.
In general, I think one can con
clude that the West Point speech re
flected a weariness with foreign in
volvements that characterizes the
present mood in the White House,
Congress and the country as a whole.
At the same time, President Obama
appropriately warned us that the dan
gers of terrorism are shifting and
changing, and that the struggle against
its increasingly diverse manifestations
is far from over. Interesting in this con
text was his plan to appropriate con
siderable funds for allies and "friends"
around the world who might be

threatened by terrorist attacks in their
own countries.

Do you think that the idea of a lib
eral international system is under
threat?

Since the Second World War, the
"liberal international system" has
been dominated by the United States
and by the institutions that grew out
of the defeat of Nazi Germany and Im
perial Japan and the beginning of the
Cold War. There have been serious
challenges to that liberal order, but, on
the whole, it has proven to be remark
ably durable and successful.
Putin's Russia, for all of its neo
imperial bluster including the un
warranted and counterproductive an
nexation of the Crimea is as de
pendent on the liberal order as is
China. The real question here is how
the U.S., Europe and the major insti
tutions of the international system
react to violations of the "rules," if you
will, of that liberal order.
It is certainly another kind of chal
lenge when countries like Turkey and
Thailand reverse the course of democ
racy and become more authoritarian.
But here, too, one could argue that the
liberal international system has been
able to absorb all but a few outliers
(North Korea and Iran, as examples).
Swings in the historical pendulum be
tween more democratic and more au
tocratic forms of government, espe
cially in newly created democracies,
are inevitable. China and Iran will not
always have a semi-autocratic form of
government. At the same time,
democracy is not inevitable every
where.
What are the governing principles
that should guide American for
eign policy? What do we want,
what should we want?
Let me say: I think this is a funda
mentally political question and not a

scholarly one, meaning there will be
many answers, depending on one's
analysis of the state of the world and
theroleofAmericainit. But I do think
there are several principles to keep in
mind.

One is that the United States is
by far the most powerful country in
the world, and with that power comes
the responsibility to be involved and
active in the international system.
Obamawas right to reject isolationism
in its various forms at West Point.
The second is that the United
States needs to think carefully and
well about "foreign involvements."
The country has launched a series of
interventions that have exacted ex
tremely high costs in human lives,
both of our own citizens and those of
our enemies and allies abroad; in this
country's "treasure," which could be
used in productive and important
ways at home; and in the destruction
of social and economic infrastructures
in countries where the U.S. has inter
vened and wars have been fought.
The third is that we are, indeed,
the "indispensable nation," meaning
we cannot turn our backs on danger
ous situations that threaten to esca
late. The line between "appease
ment" and efforts at peace making is
not at all easy to discern. At the same
time, it is crucial to back agile diploma
cy with military power.
Are we consistent with these prin
ciples? Is it possible to be consis
tent with them?
Absolute consistency is, of
course, impossible. There will be situ
ations where intervention will cause
more problems than it solves. Some
times, military intervention is the only
sensible policy alternative. Other
cases require a high level of mobiliza
tion of American and allied resources
I'm thinking of the Ukrainian crisis
but where military action would not be a rea
sonable option.
The West Point speech was notable in the
absence of any kind of "grand strategy." Some
scholars suggest that this is not a period
where a grand strategy is useful. But I do think
that between the poles of articulating such a
strategy and reacting to one crisis after anoth
er, there should to be a strong and supple
framework for the pursuit of American for
eign policy. The Obama administration does
not create the impression at home or abroad

that such a framework exists.
