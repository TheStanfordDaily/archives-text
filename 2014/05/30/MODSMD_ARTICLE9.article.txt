# Senior Moments
## 
### 
In light of the 011-too-rapidly approaching date of graduation, The Daily's only active editor from the Class
of 2014, Daniel Lupin, took a moment to ask his fellow classmates - Hope Burke, Eric Mochalski, Stephanie
Phipps and Sean Senters -to reflect on their past four years as student-athletes, share their wisdom with
their younger peers and, in the process, look ahead to the future.

Stephanie Phipps
Women's Diving
Phipps finished her diving career as
a two-time Ail-American in the 3-
meter competition, finishing 16th
at the NCAAs in 2011 and eighth in
2012. She earned a pair of Pac-12
titles during her time at Stanford,
taking home the 3-meter title in
2013 and the 1 -meter title in 2014.
She was named the Pac-10's Fresh
man Diver of the Year for the
2010-11 season. Phipps will em
bark on life after Stanford at Van
derbilt in the fall, where she will
begin studying to earn her master's
degree in speech-language pathol

TSD: How has being a student-athlete at Stanford in particular shaped
your collegiate experience?
SP: Being a student-athlete at Stanford shaped everything about my Stanford
experience. Having a couple hours of practice a day meant I had to plan fur
ther ahead to complete assignments, but I learned how to work extremely effi
ciently. It means I missed a lot of dorm trips, but got to compete at a lot of meets
around the country. It means most days I ate lunch while biking to practice, but I
got to cool off in the pool during practice on hot days. There is something spe
cial about knowing you are a part of a team that is expecting you to be at prac
tice on time (aka 15 minutes early) and ready to go every day. Sure, you often
have to make tough choices between your sport and social life, and academics,
but it is worth it.
TSD: What's the best piece of advice you have received or want to share?
SP: My coach always told us to never be late, because being late is like telling
someone that your time is more important than theirs.

Eric Mochalski
Men's Volleyball
Mochalski was a four-year starter at
two different positions for the Stanford
men's volleyball team, earning three
All-MPSF conference recognitions dur
ing his career, including second-team
honors as a senior when he switched
from middle blocker to opposite. He
finished his career with 849 kills, 326
blocks, 313 digs and 62 aces, placing
him in the top 10 all-time in Stanford
volleyball history in several statistical
categories, including blocks, service
aces and single-season blocks. He
hopes to continue his playing career
next year in Europe.

TSD: What's the best piece of advice you have received or want to share?
EM: The best piece of advice I have is to cherish each season, each match and
each practice. They fly by so fast. Every day is an opportunity to get better at your
craft and grow closer to the people who you will be friends with for the rest of
your life. Cherish the opportunity to be in a gym or on a field with some of your
closest friends because it goes by fast and is a once in a lifetime experience. We
are lucky enough to go to the best school in the world as far as sports and school
are concerned, so cherish it.
TSD: Is there anything in particular from being a student-athlete at Stanford
that you will take with you as you head into the real world?
EM: I will take having an open mind and the willingness to try new things away
from Stanford. This school offers so many diverse opportunities, and I have been
fortunate.


Hope Burke
Field Hockey
Burke was a three-year starter during
her decorated career as a forward for
the Stanford field hockey team, gar
nering numerous all-conference and
all-academic team selections, earning
the Sheryl Johnson Academic Excel
lence Award during her senior year.
She finished her career with 30 goals
and 25 assists, and was recently
named one of the fourteen athletic
honorees for the Stanford Alumni As
sociation's Award of Excellence. Next
year, she will begin working for Teach
for America as an English teacher in
Baltimore.

TSD: What has been the best part of your student-athlete experience, or your
favorite memory at Stanford (could be sports related or not)?
HB: The best part of my student-athlete experience was putting on a Stanford jer
sey every day. Many people think that athletes only wear athletic gear because
they are rolling out to class from practice or are tired from their morning workout,
but it was honestly such an honor to be able to wear the Stanford "S". It reminded
me of all of the sacrifice, dedication and hard work that my teammates and I com
mitted to field hockey every day.
TSD: Do you feel as though being a student-athlete at Stanford has better
prepared you for the future? If so, in what ways?
HB: Being a student-athlete has definitely strengthened my time management skills
and taught me how to persevere and give my best effort even when things were
difficult. Of course, I have a greater understanding of what it means to contribute
to a team. One of my coach's biggest sayings was "you hold each other's dreams
in your hands," and I always took that very seriously. I had to give my best effort
100% of the time because my teammates were counting on me to ensure every
one's success.
TSD: Is there anything in particular from being a student-athlete at Stanford
that you will take with you as you head into the real world?
HB: The one thing I will take from being a student-athlete is to always stay in the
present. It is easy to get mentally caught up in different problems, but taking each
day one step at a time and really taking the extra moment to appreciate every
thing you have makes such a huge difference.

Sean Senters
Men's Gymnastics
With one year of eligibility remaining,
Senters is already a five-time All-
American for the Stanford men's gym
nastics team. At the NCAA Individual
Event Finals this year, he finished third
on vault and eighth on floor, after
having finished fifth and eighth, re
spectively, the year before. Senters
has also proved a crucial component
for Stanford during team competition,
after he finished third in vault and
10th on floor during the NCAA finals.
Next year, Sean will complete his final
season of eligibility for the team while
pursuing his master's in communica
tions.

TSD: What has been the best part of your student-athlete experience, or
your favorite memory at Stanford (could be sports related or not)?
SS: My best memory as a Stanford student-athlete was being a part of Stan
ford's 100 th national championship-winning team my freshman year. It was
truly an indescribable experience of hard work, passion and perseverance cul
minating into something amazing, especially for those seniors who poured their
heart and soul into amazing careers.
TSD: Is there anything in particular from being a student-athlete at Stan
ford that you will take with you as you head into the real world?
SS: Just really the concept of representing something more than yourself, which
in life you continually will. You represent your family, your company, etc. It's al
ways going to be about more than you.
TSD: What's the piece of advice you have received or want to share?
SS: It was my first week of practices here and I was struggling a lot, and our
then-assistant coach Brett McClure told me, "Whether you think you can or you
can't, you're right..." It's definitely one I go back to when I'm struggling.
TSD: Where do you see yourself in 10 years?
SS: I would love to be working on some sort of national political campaign as a
campaign manager/strategist or a speechwriter, perhaps as a chief of staff.
