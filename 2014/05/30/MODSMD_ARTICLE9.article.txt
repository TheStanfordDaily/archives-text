# Senior Moments

### 
In light of the 011-too-rapidly approaching date of graduation, The Daily's only active editor from the Class
of 2014, Daniel Lupin, took a moment to ask his fellow classmates - Hope Burke, Eric Mochalski, Stephanie
Phipps and Sean Senters -to reflect on their past four years as student-athletes, share their wisdom with
their younger peers and, in the process, look ahead to the future.

Stephanie Phipps
Women's Diving
Phipps finished her diving career as
a two-time Ail-American in the 3-
meter competition, finishing 16th
at the NCAAs in 2011 and eighth in
2012. She earned a pair of Pac-12
titles during her time at Stanford,
taking home the 3-meter title in
2013 and the 1 -meter title in 2014.
She was named the Pac-10's Fresh
man Diver of the Year for the
2010-11 season. Phipps will em
bark on life after Stanford at Van
derbilt in the fall, where she will
begin studying to earn her master's
degree in speech-language pathol

TSD: How has being a student-athlete at Stanford in particular shaped
your collegiate experience?
SP: Being a student-athlete at Stanford shaped everything about my Stanford
experience. Having a couple hours of practice a day meant I had to plan fur
ther ahead to complete assignments, but I learned how to work extremely effi
ciently. It means I missed a lot of dorm trips, but got to compete at a lot of meets
around the country. It means most days I ate lunch while biking to practice, but I
got to cool off in the pool during practice on hot days. There is something spe
cial about knowing you are a part of a team that is expecting you to be at prac
tice on time (aka 15 minutes early) and ready to go every day. Sure, you often
have to make tough choices between your sport and social life, and academics,
but it is worth it.
TSD: What's the best piece of advice you have received or want to share?
SP: My coach always told us to never be late, because being late is like telling
someone that your time is more important than theirs.

Eric Mochalski
Men's Volleyball
Mochalski was a four-year starter at
two different positions for the Stanford
men's volleyball team, earning three
All-MPSF conference recognitions dur
ing his career, including second-team
honors as a senior when he switched
from middle blocker to opposite. He
finished his career with 849 kills, 326
blocks, 313 digs and 62 aces, placing
him in the top 10 all-time in Stanford
volleyball history in several statistical
categories, including blocks, service
aces and single-season blocks. He
hopes to continue his playing career
next year in Europe.

TSD: What's the best piece of advice you have received or want to share?
EM: The best piece of advice I have is to cherish each season, each match and
each practice. They fly by so fast. Every day is an opportunity to get better at your
craft and grow closer to the people who you will be friends with for the rest of
your life. Cherish the opportunity to be in a gym or on a field with some of your
closest friends because it goes by fast and is a once in a lifetime experience. We
are lucky enough to go to the best school in the world as far as sports and school
are concerned, so cherish it.
TSD: Is there anything in particular from being a student-athlete at Stanford
that you will take with you as you head into the real world?
EM: I will take having an open mind and the willingness to try new things away
from Stanford. This school offers so many diverse opportunities, and I have been
fortunate.
