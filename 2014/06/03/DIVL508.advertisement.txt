Admission to this course is by application only. We will collaboratively write,
design, and illustrate a full-length graphic novel. We are looking for artists,
writers, designers, and all-around team players. This will be an intense,
challenging, rewarding class, but with a heavy workload.
The graphic novel project will take place over two 5-credit classes offered
during fall and winter quarters; preference will be given to students who can
complete both terms, but it is possible to take the class for only one of those
terms. It also fulfills the Creative Expression requirement.
It's not necessary to have experience drawing to be a part of the course,
although thinking visually will of course be crucial.
To apply, include on one side of a sheet of paper: your name, email, major,
minor, graduating year, any creative writing, art, or design classes you've
taken, with the instructor's name. And two paragraphs: one that briefly
describes your interest in the course, and the second, of no more than three
sentences, that is a pitch for a possible story based in nonaction (a sample of
the kind of ideas you'd bring to brainstorming sessions over the first couple
of weeks of class). Also, indicate whether you will be able to take the course
in both fall and winter terms.
On the other side of the paper: Anything. Text, graphics, illustrations, etc.
Communicate your skills, experience, and enthusiasm.
Feel free to stop by the Creative Writing office to pick up a free copy of one of
our previous graphic novels to give you an idea of the work we have pro
duced in the past.
Email any questions to the instructors. Drop off or mail applications to the
Creative Writing Office by September 9th. Address:
