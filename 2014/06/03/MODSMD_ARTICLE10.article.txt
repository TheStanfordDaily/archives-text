## Cooliris plants Stanford roots 
### KYLIE JUE DESK EDITOR 
Established in 2006 by Soujanya Bhumkar,
Austin Shoemaker 'O5 and their co-founders,
Cooliris is a company that focuses on optimizing
users' online and mobile media experiences.
Prom the start, the company has had deep roots
in the Stanford community in fact, the start
up began with eight full-time workers and 40
Stanford interns.
Who they are
Shoemaker, founder and current chief tech
nology officer of Cooliris, attended Stanford as
an undergraduate and eventually left the mas
ter's program in computer science in 2007 to
work full time on the startup with his co-founder,
who he met in his Stanford MS&E 180 course.

While many Silicon Valley tech companies have close ties to Stanford, Cooliris has leveraged its connection to Stanford in away that
no other startup has. Since its founding in 2006, Cooliris has had over 200 interns, with 75 percent of them being Stanford students.
potentials of online media.
"[We asked], 'Why not go be
yond the browser frame and launch
it into a full-screen experience?'"
Shoemaker said, "which had us
move onto the next product and
which had us bringing media to life,
creating a more visual immersive
experience for media on the web."
Today, Cooliris's primary prod
uct is an app that allows users to
browse, share and view their photos
in one place.
Bhumkar, also a co-founder and
the current CEO of Cooliris, was a
chemical engineer before receiving
his MBA from the University of
Chicago. He then moved to the Bay
Area and worked at several differ
ent startups before joining the
Cooliris team.
"Cooliris always has been fo
cused on giving a highly relevant
yet delightful experience to users,"
Bhumkar said.
Bhumkar explained how the
company has shifted its focus with
the rise of iOS and Android. Cooliris
began by looking at media such as
photos and videos in the web space,
and has now expanded to include
mobile applications to accommo
date the smartphone ecosystem. In
general, the company aims to cre
ate a unique media experience for
users.
"We've actually done a series of
products where we now find our
selves in a very interesting space
where privacy is very important to
the consumers, and media is to be
considered a first-class experience
rather than an attachment,"
Bhumkar said.
Although the company is al
ready over six years old, it has
maintained its label as a startup
with a team of 16 people, half in en
gineering and half in other business
and design fields. Earlier this year,
the company relocated from Palo
Alto to its new office in San Francis
co.
"We've filed over 22 [patents]
and two of them have already been
granted," Bhumkar said. "That's
one big advantage of being in the
business for that long."
Stanford's impact
Since its founding in 2006,
Cooliris has had over 200 interns,
and over three quarters of them
have come from Stanford. Both
Shoemaker and Bhumkar ex
plained that the company's Stan
ford roots have not only given stu
dents the opportunity to work at the
startup, but also have benefited
Cooliris itself.
Cooliris's first investor, a Klein
er Perkins Caufield & Byers (KP)
partner, was one of Shoemaker's
professors at Stanford. Shoemaker
also spoke about the importance of
taking ENGR 145: Technology En
trepreneurship for helping him
build connections and putting him
in a real-world situation similar to
running a company.
"Having Stanford in the commu
nity and just having all of the people
who really want to be a part of doing
something new was great," Shoe
maker said. "We were able to get a
bunch of really talented, smart,
driven people to help us push our vi
sion forward."
Shoemaker explained that the
company is always looking for more
Stanford students to join the team,
and according to Bhumkar, Stan
ford's Mayfield Fellows program
has paired fellows with Cooliris.
"What I find about Stanford stu
dents is they're not afraid about
challenging the status quo,"
Bhumkar said. "I'm always amazed
at how that thinking comes in, and
the passion is to always make things
obsolete things that were until
yesterday making sense... Ido not
find that trait in other schools."

In addition, Stanford's Women
in Business Springternship pro
gram has been directly connecting
the company with Stanford interns
for the last four to five spring quar
ters. This quarter Kitty Kwan 'l7
and Tess Bloch-Horowitz 'l7 in
terned at Cooliris.

Bloch-Horowitz spoke about the
difference between attending a uni
versity where entrepreneurship is
so prominent and actually under
standing what it means to work at a
startup.

"It's been great to bridge that
gap between Stanford and the real
world and actually have a learning
experience that's not just in the
classroom," Bloch-Horowitz said.
"[lt's] taking what I've learned in
the classroom and applying it with
fellow Stanford students and grad
uates and actually having a con
crete product that comes out of that
work."
Bloch-Horowitz explained that
employees at Cooliris can work on
projects unrelated to their field and
that everyone claims to work on the
"whatever-it-takes" team.
"As interns, we're definitely just
as much a part of the process, and
you can see that it makes more of an
environment where people feel
comfortable asking for help,"
Bloch-Horowitz said. "You'll see an
engineer working on something
completely irrelevant [to their field]
but really willing and happy to do
it."
Kwan expressed similar senti
ments and agreed that even interns
can be heavily involved with the
company.
"I really like that I'm able to talk
directly to the CEO about my con
cerns and what I want to accom
plish and projects I want to do to
give me skill sets that I want to
learn," Kwan said.

The new app
Cooliris has plans to release a
new visual messaging app in mid-
June. The product will focus on
photo sharing. Bhumkar explained
that the app follows trends that
demonstrate consumers' decreas
ing differentiation between mes
saging and sharing.
"Most of the time I would say
that messaging apps were aimed at
letting you stay connected, and we
feel like that phase is over,"
Bhumkar said. "It's about going be
yond just staying connected. It's
about enriching that experience."
While still keeping data private,
the app will transform users' con
versations into a visual messaging
format for easy photo sharing and
access to additional features. Kwan
spoke about the app's relevance to
the Stanford community.
"The new product [Cooliris is]
launching can really help to organ
ize the way photos are sent between
two people," Kwan said. "I think it's
a really useful medium of communi
cation, especially between groups."
With the founders of WhatsApp
and Snapchat also coming from
Stanford, Bhumkar believes that
there is a connection between the
University and messaging in gener
al.
"There is something about Stan
ford and messaging," Bhumkar
said.
