## OP-ED Responding to rape at Stanford 
### Anna Ninan Jonny Dorsey 
Provost Etchemendy's mes
sage in response to Evan
Spiegel's emails rightly re
ceived praise across campus, social
media and news outlets. As we heed
Etchemendy's call to "reflect on our
common values," we find ourselves
wondering this: How can we launch
a more powerful response to sexual
violence?
We are offended by Spiegel's lan
guage and the culture it promotes,
but we are more incensed by the
very real violence perpetrated by
and against Stanford students and
our collective insufficient response
to it. Too many of our peers are vio
lated by their classmates every year.
A 2012 Vaden student survey re
vealed that four percent of Stanford
students report that they have been
raped, seven percent penetrated
sexually against their will and 15
percent have engaged in intercourse
under pressure. This must change.
Many throw up their hands and
say we are doing all we can. That's
not true. With a $l9 billion endow
ment, 22 Nobel Laureates and an
unstoppable innovation engine, we
have no excuse for failure. Stanford
can lead the country in addressing
sexual assault but only if we
choose to. Here are three meaning
ful steps we can take right now:

1. Expel Rapists
While rape survivors are com
mon, rapists are less so. Repeat of
fenders account for nine out of every
10 rapes on college campuses, rap
ing an average of 5.8 victims. Since
most rapes aren't reported, rapists
can be hard to identify. When stu
dents are found guilty of rape, they
should face expulsion, not a mere
suspension. This is not only for the
sake of justice, but also to prevent
future violence.
Unfortunately, expulsion is not
Stanford's modus operandi. Accord
ing to Stanford Law School profes
sor Michele Dauber, who headed the
Board of Judicial Affairs from 2011-
13 and was one of the authors of the
Alternate Review Process (ARP),
there were nine cases of students
found responsible for sexual assault
between 2005-11. Eight cases in
volved suspensions, and only one
student a serial rapist was ex
pelled. Stanford should follow Dart
mouth, Amherst and Duke in adopt
ing mandatory expulsion for stu
dents found guilty of sexual assault.

2. Increase Investment in Preven
tion and Response
Addressing sexual assault re
quires sustained and comprehensive
interventions. Stanford's current
programs are under resourced. The

Sexual Assault and Relationship
Abuse Office has two staff members,
and one seat was recently vacated.
That won't do.
Stanford can and should invest
more in efforts like those highlight
ed by the White House Task Force to
Protect Students From Sexual As
sault, including bystander education
and comprehensive survivor sup
port.
Stanford should also share infor
mation about where assaults occur.
Currently students are deprived of
information they could use to make
informed decisions about staying as
safe as possible on campus as well as
data they could use to advocate for
changes in dangerous houses. If the
administration won't do this, stu
dents should innovate or partner
with third-party organizations
Ushahidi or Sexual Health Innova
tions, for example â€”to make this
happen.
Stanford can also lead in student
designed innovations and program
ming. Students have a critical view
from the trenches that, combined
with the school's entrepreneurial
culture, can bring fresh approaches
to the issue of sexual violence. A so
cial innovation competition and
funding to student groups could
