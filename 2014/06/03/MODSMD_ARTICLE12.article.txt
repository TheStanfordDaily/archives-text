# FROM THE OPINIONS DESK
## The 						new, new, new thing 
### Winston Shi 
Back in high school, my Latin
teacherwas fond ofteachingus
quotes from the old Romans.
As with everything else in New Eng
land, they often seemed to have a cer
tain stubbornly aspirational per
haps even Victorian flavor to
them. Tempusfugit. Ad astraper
aspera. Dum vida est, spes est.
Ant vincere aut mori. (Time flies;
through difficulty to the stars; when
there is life there is hope; either to
conquer or to die.)
After a while, these quotes felt a
little worn, although our teachers
were not at fault for that. Rather, we
were so used to hearing the ideas that
these quotes expressed because they
had been impressed into us every day
of our lives. We heard them from
teachers in years past, saw them in
society and its expectations (both ad
mirable and not so admirable) and
felt an ineffable but nevertheless con
tinuing sense that there was a certain
way to live life and that going forward
we would inexorably adhere to it. The
fact that these quotes had been writ
ten in Latin only reinforced this fact:
we have been making motivational
quotations for thousands of years.
Needless to say, we will continue to
make them. Perfection enthralls us;
hope sustains us; glory is the stuff of
our dreams.
I arrived at the opinions section
preaching the same kind of aspira
tions that humans have preached for
centuries. Needless to say, there are
things I have done well; there are
other things I regret. I will not bore
you with a recap of my time here; let
it suffice to say that I have enjoyed
playing Mercury for the last four
months.
I have massively enjoyed my time
at opinions. Like Mercury, the divine
messenger of Roman myth, I've had
the opportunity to sit at the cross
roads of the Stanford community, lis
tening to people and their questions,
their issues, their loves and their as
pirations. There have been things I
wish I had never had to hear, but
these are part and parcel of the
human condition, and we all need to
hear them. There have also been
things I am glad to have helped pub
licize, writers that I have been hon
ored to work with and ideas that I
wish I had created. Contrary to pop
ular belief, responsibility does seem
to inspire a certain humility, at least
in this case.

The opinions section has been a
good thing for me, and I will forever
be grateful to it. But I nevertheless
feel that it's time to move on.

I'll be sticking around, of course: I
did say that I would only be leaving
sports "for the time being," after all,
and I cannot wait for football season
to return. But as with my last
farewell, I should first thank a com
munity that has resolutely supported
me throughout my time here my
columnists, my indefatigable staff
and all the people I see here every day.
I didn't come to Stanford expect
ing to write for The Daily. To be hon
est, I believed that I'd never end up
working here in any serious capacity.
When I first arrived on campus, I
signed up to write news articles on a
very, very occasional basis, but I even
tually ended working at The Daily be
cause I found a group of people that I
enjoyed spending time with.
Do-Hyoung Park, whose own
farewell of sorts is also running today,
is right: there's not much inherent to
the job itself that justifies the sort of
sacrifices we make to be here. Every
body in the newsroom is j oined in fre
netic days and sleepless nights be
cause we have collectively made the

decision to have this institution define
our Stanford experiences. And
everybody is here, too, because we
enjoy the work that we do —we
enjoy being at the campus cross
roads. And if I may pump up my own
section for a second, I believe that
opinions is uniquely placed to achieve
that.
IH still be writing for opinions,
which will be in good hands with Nick
Ahamed at the helm going forward.
Next year, as I embrace abigger wilt
ing role, I'm glad to have the chance
to travel and see the country. I'm also
excited to keep on working with a
wonderful staff—Jana, Joey, Ash
ley, Do, George, Jordan, Cameron,
Michael, Dylan, David and Vihan
and special thanks to Vihan, who like
me will be making the trip back from
opinions to sports. But enough shout
outs for now.
We're all here for the people
the people within our walls, and the
people without them as well. Thank
you from the bottom of my heart.

This is my last act as Managing
Editor of Opinions at The Stanford
Daily, and as with all last acts, there
must be a certain retrospective ele
ment to a goodbye even if this isn't
quite a goodbye. We aspire to a lot
here, and we know full well that we

often won't fulfill these dreams. Obvi
ously, when we fail, that failure is dis
appointing. But I remain convinced
that the dream in and of itself is why
we are here.
Aspirations seek to embrace eter
nity. But aspirations also become
eternity. Our dreams will last, and
that is good enough. Humans seek
eternity, whether in achievement or
in memory, and although opinions are
by definition transient since the
ideas and issues we cover change and
will always change the institution
of the opinions section is most defi
nitely not. As with Ted Williams, as
with football, as with everything in
life itself, even in transience we can
chase posterity, brilliance and beauty.
Perhaps that makes sense: we admire
posterity because, as transient be
ings, posterity is something we are
not.
One more Latin quote for you,
then invoking not the Romans but
one of their greatest successors, an
artist that only lived for a short while
but whose legacy has stood the test of
time.
Ille hie est Rajfael timuit quo
sospite vinci, rerum magna
parens et ?norie?ite tnori, mean
ing: "Here lies that famous Raphael,
by whom Nature feared to be con
quered while he lived, and when he
was dying, feared herself to die."
That's an aspiration we can look
up to. Thank you very much.
