# FROM THE OPINIONS DESK

Back in high school, my Latin
teacherwas fond ofteachingus
quotes from the old Romans.
As with everything else in New Eng
land, they often seemed to have a cer
tain stubbornly aspirational per
haps even Victorian flavor to
them. Tempusfugit. Ad astraper
aspera. Dum vida est, spes est.
Ant vincere aut mori. (Time flies;
through difficulty to the stars; when
there is life there is hope; either to
conquer or to die.)
After a while, these quotes felt a
little worn, although our teachers
were not at fault for that. Rather, we
were so used to hearing the ideas that
these quotes expressed because they
had been impressed into us every day
of our lives. We heard them from
teachers in years past, saw them in
society and its expectations (both ad
mirable and not so admirable) and
felt an ineffable but nevertheless con
tinuing sense that there was a certain
way to live life and that going forward
we would inexorably adhere to it. The
fact that these quotes had been writ
ten in Latin only reinforced this fact:
we have been making motivational
quotations for thousands of years.
Needless to say, we will continue to
make them. Perfection enthralls us;
hope sustains us; glory is the stuff of
our dreams.
I arrived at the opinions section
preaching the same kind of aspira
tions that humans have preached for
centuries. Needless to say, there are
things I have done well; there are
other things I regret. I will not bore
you with a recap of my time here; let
it suffice to say that I have enjoyed
playing Mercury for the last four
months.
I have massively enjoyed my time
at opinions. Like Mercury, the divine
messenger of Roman myth, I've had
the opportunity to sit at the cross
roads of the Stanford community, lis
tening to people and their questions,
their issues, their loves and their as
pirations. There have been things I
wish I had never had to hear, but
these are part and parcel of the
human condition, and we all need to
hear them. There have also been
things I am glad to have helped pub
licize, writers that I have been hon
ored to work with and ideas that I
wish I had created. Contrary to pop
ular belief, responsibility does seem
to inspire a certain humility, at least
in this case.

The opinions section has been a
good thing for me, and I will forever
be grateful to it. But I nevertheless
feel that it's time to move on.

I'll be sticking around, of course: I
did say that I would only be leaving
sports "for the time being," after all,
and I cannot wait for football season
to return. But as with my last
farewell, I should first thank a com
munity that has resolutely supported
me throughout my time here my
columnists, my indefatigable staff
and all the people I see here every day.
I didn't come to Stanford expect
ing to write for The Daily. To be hon
est, I believed that I'd never end up
working here in any serious capacity.
When I first arrived on campus, I
signed up to write news articles on a
very, very occasional basis, but I even
tually ended working at The Daily be
cause I found a group of people that I
enjoyed spending time with.
Do-Hyoung Park, whose own
farewell of sorts is also running today,
is right: there's not much inherent to
the job itself that justifies the sort of
sacrifices we make to be here. Every
body in the newsroom is j oined in fre
netic days and sleepless nights be
cause we have collectively made the

We will continue to
beaspirational.
Perfection enthralls
us;hope sustains us;
glory is the stuff
of our dreams.
