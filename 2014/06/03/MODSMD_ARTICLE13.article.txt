## Asexual and kinky â€“ what? 
### Lily Zheng 
UTA oes that make sense?" I
task, and my friend nods
at me. I've just finished
answering the classic question,
"What the hell is kink?" but the per
son I'm talking to seems to have
something else on their mind.
"What's up?"
He hesitate a good five seconds.
"Is the... sex any better?"
So many people I talk to talk or ask
about kinky sex as a single idea that
I've almost stopped responding to it.
It's not that the idea of kink and sex
being married is wrong many
people can attest to that experience,
and some people can't even have sex
without kink but for me, I've al
ways listened to those experiences
and discussions in a state of confu
sion. Kink has never been even re
motely linked to sex for me, and for a
long time I thought that was some
thing I should be feeling guilty
about. I identify as asexual. Was I
even alloived to be kinky?
Asexuality isn't very well under
stood, neither as a sexual identity
nor as a queer identity. Asexual peo
ple are commonly perceived as just
"being abstinent" or just "not hav
ing good sex," but just like every
thing else worth writing about, asex
uality is infinitely more complicated.
Some asexual people describe sex as
analogous to someone sticking a fin
ger in their nose repeatedly (some
what bizarre, kinkiness aside); some
asexual people describe sex as being
pleasurable but not a fun pleasure;
some asexual people are some of the
most sensual, physical people I
know but feel completely ambiva
lent towards the idea of sex.
That last group describes me
pretty well. I like the feel of bodies
together, faces close together, hands
tracing patterns on each other's
backs. Most people would call that
"foreplay"; I just call it a good time.
I absolutely love intimacy but if
you take off your pants and look at

me expectantly, I'll just be confused.
What, you want me to put a party hat
on it?
Asexuality for me doesn't mean I
don't have emotions. It doesn't mean
I can't fall in love or that I can't like
the way it feels falling asleep togeth
er under the sheets. But while all
that's well and good, asexuality and
kink seem to be incompatible or
at least seemed incompatible at
first. For me to understand what I
was feeling, I had to try to under
stand the taboo topics of sex, pleas
ure, orgasm and kink.
Sex, especially on a college cam
pus, is linked almost unbreakably to
the idea of orgasm. Talk about
blowjobs to any of your friends if
they open up, most likely you'll hear
about how long it took for a specific
person to orgasm, how good it felt, if
orgasm happened at all (in which
case an element of shame often gets
involved). Sex today here at Stan
ford is primarily about orgasm, es
pecially as an indicator of compe
tence among the communities of
people who have sex.
But plenty of people I know at
tach next to no significance to or
gasm. Granted, an orgasm is pleas
urable, but there are so many other
ways to experience the same amount
of pleasure that orgasm loses its sa
cred status. Instead of orgasm being
the goal, pleasure itself becomes the
goal. With kink, I have slowly real
ized that I describe my experiences
as good or bad depending on how
good I was able to feel and how good
my partner was able to feel. Inter
estingly enough, that description
does not necessarily include sex.
Thinking of kink and sex as sepa
rate things was incredibly validat
ing. It was one of those 4 a.m. revela
tions that makes you sit bolt upright
in bed and stare at the wall as you try
to comprehend things. If the goal
changes from orgasm to pleasure,
kink is made legitimate without at
tacking those who enjoy sex. By
moving away from such a fixation on
sex (evidenced by words like sexy,
sexuality or erotic) towards
pleasure itself, we can expand our
ideas of what "acceptable" means
and at the same time introduce new
words into our vocabulary.
Kink is not sex and that's
never more obvious than when I talk
about bondage or roleplay or pain.
Physical pleasure and enjoyment
without arousal or sex is such a for
eign concept that we as a society
label it as deviance or pathologize it

as some sort of disorder. What this
shows, though, is simply that we
need better ways to talk about
pleasure than the word "sex."
Lights-off-missionary-style is defi
nitely not the only way people today
can be intimate! The existence of
kinky asexual people doesn't mean
that we are outliers or deviants
rather, if we exist, then common as
sumptions and preconceptions of
sex, pleasure and kink could use
some looking over.
That's why I always respond to
the "you're asexual and kinky?" ques
tion with an "am I not allowed to be?"
So what if I don't like sex? I bet I
can have just as much fun with a
blindfold, some clothespins and a
sadist. Or seven.
