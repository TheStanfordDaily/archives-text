# ANDREWS ASSESSMENT
## Color-blind politics? 
### McKenzie Andrews 
A few weeks ago, a friend came
into my room and said she
needed to debrief. She'd gone
to "Take Back the Night" and want
ed to talk through her emotions
after listening to the stories she'd
heard.
Take Back the Night is a rally
held across the nation to protest vi
olence against women. There is a
rally in White Plaza that moves to a
silent candlelight march and vigil
and concludes with a "Speakout" to
bring the community together. As
the Take Back the Night website
notes, "At lease one out of every
three women worldwide has been
the victim of sexual or domestic vio
lence. As many as one in six men are
also believed to be victims of sexual
or domestic violence in their life
times. Of these crimes, less than 50
percent are reported to the police."
For many students at Stanford,
the most visible way we see sexual
assault is when we see SU alerts on
our phones and in our email inboxes.
"The suspect is described as a heavy
set white or Hispanic male, approx
imately 5'6" tall, of unknown age,
wearing dark pants and a dark grey
or navy long-sleeved sweatshirt."
The reality, however, is that most
sexual assault doesn't occur in back
alleys by strangers wandering in
sweatshirts, but in more familiar
places. According to a recent Time
article, a study of the males at the
University of Massachusetts found
that 6.4 percent of college men com
mit or attempt rape; however,
among that relatively small group of
perpetrators, more than half were
repeat offenders, averaging close to
six rapes each. Most guys aren't
getting girls drunk to sleep with
them, but there's a pattern occur
ring with those who do.
When I was a freshman in col
lege, I went to a frat party in spring
quarter. A guy I'd used to see had
recently pledged, and I had just
come back from bowling at a Screw
Your Roommate event. He had in
vited me to go to with his friend to
the event, so after our group re

turned to campus, everyone headed
to his frat.
When I got to the party, I imme
diately started drinking. Within
twenty minutes, I'd taken several
standard drinks worth of shots, and
my former something/new frat star
began getting forward. I'm a friend
ly drunk, and before I could process,
the guy I hadn't seen in three
months was convincing my drunken
self to go back to his dorm. During
the course of the party, three sepa
rate people had approached me and
asked if I was okay. I laughed and
said, I can't consent, because
I'm drunk. When we left together,
I wanted to bike, but my frat friend
discouraged that as we stumbled
back to his room.
Fortunately that night, my
friend passed out before anything I
really regret happened. As I left
around 2:30 a.m., I ran into an RA
who gave me tea, listened to me try
to process what had happened and
biked me back to the side of campus
that I came from. It wasn't until
later that weekend when I de
briefed with a gay friend that he
pointed out that I'd been sexually
assaulted.
It's an issue that occurs to 19
percent of undergraduate women
before graduation. President
Obama recently released a video
with Vice President Biden, Daniel
Craig, Seth Meyers and Steve
Carell calling to end sexual assault
and underlining that sexual assault
isn't just a women's issue. As Biden
states in the video, "This is about re
spect, responsibility."
Only 12 percent of rapes of col
lege women are reported to law en
forcement. As cited in the same
Time article, a 2007 study by the
National Institute of Justice found
that over a third of victims did not
report their assault to law enforce
ment, because they were unsure
whether what "they had experi
enced was a crime and whether
harm was intended." It's not just
about the victim and the perpetra
tor, but the bystander too. If you see

something, speak up.
Addendum: Defining sexual as
sault
Sexual intercourse is con
sidered non-consensual and,
therefore, rape when the person
is incapable of giving consent
because s/he is incapacitated
from alcohol and/or drugs, or if
a mental disorder or develop
mental or physical disability
renders the victim incapable of
giving consent. Whether the ac
cused is a stranger, acquain
tance, spouse or friend is irrel
evant to the legal definition of
rape.
Beside rape, other acts of
sexual assault include forced
anal intercourse, forced oral
copulation, penetration of the
anal or vaginal area with a for
eign object and. forcibly touch
ing an intimate part of another
person. Men as well as women
can be victims of these other
forms of sexual assault.

assault is when we see SU alerts on
our phones and in our email inboxes.
"The suspect is described as a heavy
set white or Hispanic male, approx
imately 5'6" tall, of unknown age,
wearing dark pants and a dark grey
or navy long-sleeved sweatshirt."
The reality, however, is that most
sexual assault doesn't occur in back
alleys by strangers wandering in
sweatshirts, but in more familiar
places. According to a recent Time
article, a study of the males at the
University of Massachusetts found
that 6.4 percent of college men com
mit or attempt rape; however,
among that relatively small group of
perpetrators, more than half were
repeat offenders, averaging close to
six rapes each. Most guys aren't
getting girls drunk to sleep with
them, but there's a pattern occur
ring with those who do.
When I was a freshman in col
lege, I went to a frat party in spring
quarter. A guy I'd used to see had
recently pledged, and I had just
come back from bowling at a Screw
Your Roommate event. He had in
vited me to go to with his friend to
the event, so after our group re

turned to campus, everyone headed
to his frat.
When I got to the party, I imme
diately started drinking. Within
twenty minutes, I'd taken several
standard drinks worth of shots, and
my former something/new frat star
began getting forward. I'm a friend
ly drunk, and before I could process,
the guy I hadn't seen in three
months was convincing my drunken
self to go back to his dorm. During
the course of the party, three sepa
rate people had approached me and
asked if I was okay. I laughed and
said, I can't consent, because
I'm drunk. When we left together,
I wanted to bike, but my frat friend
discouraged that as we stumbled
back to his room.
Fortunately that night, my
friend passed out before anything I
really regret happened. As I left
around 2:30 a.m., I ran into an RA
who gave me tea, listened to me try
to process what had happened and
biked me back to the side of campus
that I came from. It wasn't until
later that weekend when I de
briefed with a gay friend that he
pointed out that I'd been sexually
assaulted.
It's an issue that occurs to 19
percent of undergraduate women
before graduation. President
Obama recently released a video
with Vice President Biden, Daniel
Craig, Seth Meyers and Steve
Carell calling to end sexual assault
and underlining that sexual assault
isn't just a women's issue. As Biden
states in the video, "This is about re
spect, responsibility."
Only 12 percent of rapes of col
lege women are reported to law en
forcement. As cited in the same
Time article, a 2007 study by the
National Institute of Justice found
that over a third of victims did not
report their assault to law enforce
ment, because they were unsure
whether what "they had experi
enced was a crime and whether
harm was intended." It's not just
about the victim and the perpetra
tor, but the bystander too. If you see

something, speak up.
Addendum: Defining sexual as
sault
Sexual intercourse is con
sidered non-consensual and,
therefore, rape when the person
is incapable of giving consent
because s/he is incapacitated
from alcohol and/or drugs, or if
a mental disorder or develop
mental or physical disability
renders the victim incapable of
giving consent. Whether the ac
cused is a stranger, acquain
tance, spouse or friend is irrel
evant to the legal definition of
rape.
Beside rape, other acts of
sexual assault include forced
anal intercourse, forced oral
copulation, penetration of the
anal or vaginal area with a for
eign object and. forcibly touch
ing an intimate part of another
person. Men as well as women
can be victims of these other
forms of sexual assault.

A few weeks ago, a friend came
into my room and said she
needed to debrief. She'd gone
to "Take Back the Night" and want
ed to talk through her emotions
after listening to the stories she'd
heard.
Take Back the Night is a rally
held across the nation to protest vi
olence against women. There is a
rally in White Plaza that moves to a
silent candlelight march and vigil
and concludes with a "Speakout" to
bring the community together. As
the Take Back the Night website
notes, "At lease one out of every
three women worldwide has been
the victim of sexual or domestic vio
lence. As many as one in six men are
also believed to be victims of sexual
or domestic violence in their life
times. Of these crimes, less than 50
percent are reported to the police."
