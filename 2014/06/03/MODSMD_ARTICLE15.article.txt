## Stanford's weak sanctions for sexual assault leave survivors as victims 
### Rebeca Felix 
Sexual assault on college cam
puses, a topic normally sur
rounded by a culture of si
lence, has become headline news.
This is a national issue, and Stan
ford, while idealized as a palm-lined
paradise, is not exempt from reality:
sexual assault happens everywhere.
Although Stanford has avoided the
federal investigations and public
scrutiny directed at other institu
tions, our university's policies re
garding sexual violence are just as
critically flawed. As one survivor ex
pressed to me, "When Stanford told
me how it was sanctioning the man
it found responsible for forcibly sex
ually assaulting me, I felt totally
helpless."
The Stanford Alternate Review
Process (ARP) is Stanford's process
for adjudication regarding student
on student altercations, but most
students found responsible for sex
ual assault by the ARP have not
faced any significant consequences
for their actions. According to
tenured Stanford Law professor
Michele Dauber, head of the Board
of Judicial Affairs from 2011-2013,
between 2005 and 2011, nine stu
dents were found responsible for
sexual assault and one student was
expelled. The other eight students
received suspensions ranging from
1-8 quarters, sometimes including
other restrictions such as housing
bans, mandatory education and/or
community service.
Professor Dauber believes that
"expulsion is the appropriate sanc
tion for sexual assault, unless there
are highly unusual mitigating cir
cumstances. The purposes of the
Fundamental Standard and the
Penalty Code can only be carried
out if there is accountability." I
agree and believe that the only way
to hold students accountable is to
expel those parties found responsi
ble for forcible sexual assault.
Sexual assault is a problem on
our campus. A survey presented to
the Faculty Senate in 2013 noted
that out of the 175 reported sexual
assaults between 1997 and 2009,
only four students chose to pursue
cases for evaluation by Judicial Af
fairs (now known as The Office of
Community Standards), and only in
two of those cases was the accused
party found responsible.
Stanford's current ARI) suppos
edly meant to improve accountabili
ty, is a drastic but toothless im
provement. In general, the channels
presently available to student sur
vivors seeking penalties for their ac
cused assailants include filing cases

with the ARP and/or under Title IX.
But at Stanford, the only way to dis
cipline a responsible party is to file a
case with ARE A student cannot be
suspended or expelled through Title
IX at Stanford because of the Stu
dent Judicial Charter, which pro
vides a specific judicial process
prior to any and all disciplinary ac
tion, relegating survivors to the
ARP if they want to see their ac
cused attackers penalized in any
way.
Despite a parallel increase in the
number of ARP cases and parties
found responsible, most students
found to have committed sexual as
sault or misconduct are allowed to
complete their education with illu
sory and mostly confidential conse
quences. It is no surprise to me that
a survivor would question going
through the ARI) a difficult and
lengthy ordeal that delivers only the
legal equivalent of a slap on the
wrist even in cases of forcible
rape. In addition to going through
the trauma of having their stories
picked apart and questioned, sur
vivors are expected to be high-per
forming students at a rigorous insti
tution, oftentimes knowing that
even if the responding party is
found responsible, that student will
still have the privilege of attending
and graduating from Stanford. One
ARP case, currently underway, has
already taken Stanford more than
twice the 60-day ARP timeline rec
ommendation to resolve. That case
has lasted about five months,
spanned two quarters and derailed
the academic life of the rape sur
vivor involved. I will not attempt to
put into words the emotional toll
shouldered by survivors of sexual
assault.
Students who are found respon
sible and are allowed to reintegrate
back into the Stanford community
threaten the safety of the student
survivor as well as other members
of the Stanford community. A stu
dent found responsible for sexual
assault could be sitting next to you
in lecture or mixing you a drink on
Friday night. The responsible
party's confidentiality is protected,
while the survivor and other mem
bers of the community are not. Stu
dents need to be held accountable
for their actions because only
through accountability can a person
responsible of sexual assault under
stand that what they did was wrong.
So what's being done about this?
It takes engaged student leader
ship, responses to Federal Policy
and the adoption of the best prae

tices spearheaded by universities
moving to increase student safety.
At Stanford, the ASSU has commit
ted a task force to make sexual as
sault education a key issue of impor
tance and is looking to work with
other student groups to brainstorm
new and stronger policies for stu
dent and campus safety. Dartmouth
has enacted policies in response to
those set forth by the White House
Task Force, including mandatory
expulsion of repeat offenders, as
well as first-time offenders in cases
of penetration accomplished by
force, threat or purposeful incapac
itation. Expulsion is also strongly
recommended in all other cases in
volving penetration. In addition to
these new policies, Dartmouth has
established a new resource center,
and community programming edu
cating undergraduates in by
stander intervention. Peer schools
are following suit and I believe that
Stanford must enact serious
changes as well.
It is unlikely that students who
do not go through these processes
currently in place at Stanford, or
know someone going through them,
will understand how negatively our
policies impact survivors of sexual
assault. I am personally learning
about individual cases that I know
could be handled much better with
more extensive resources and more
investigators, so that each case
could be evaluated as carefully and
quickly as possible. The Student Ju
dicial Charter states: "All members
of the Stanford community are in
vited to propose suggestions about
modification of judicial procedures
to the Board." As a member of this
community I ask that Stanford
strengthen current policies and give
out sanctions that reflect the magni
tude of the violations committed by
students found responsible for sex
ual assault.
Students at Columbia, Harvard
and Brown have all encouraged sen
iors to wear strips of red tape on
their graduation caps to acknowl
edge that there is a serious issue on
their campuses and demand their
respective administrations amend
insufficient policies. I invite all
members of the senior class to join
me in wearing red tape on our caps
at commencement to support sur
vivors of sexual assault and to en
courage Stanford to do the same.

ted a task force to make sexual as
sault education a key issue of impor
tance and is looking to work with
other student groups to brainstorm
new and stronger policies for stu
dent and campus safety. Dartmouth
has enacted policies in response to
those set forth by the White House
Task Force, including mandatory
expulsion of repeat offenders, as
well as first-time offenders in cases
of penetration accomplished by
force, threat or purposeful incapac
itation. Expulsion is also strongly
recommended in all other cases in
volving penetration. In addition to
these new policies, Dartmouth has
established a new resource center,
and community programming edu
cating undergraduates in by
stander intervention. Peer schools
are following suit and I believe that
Stanford must enact serious
changes as well.
It is unlikely that students who
do not go through these processes
currently in place at Stanford, or
know someone going through them,
will understand how negatively our
policies impact survivors of sexual
assault. I am personally learning
about individual cases that I know
could be handled much better with
more extensive resources and more
investigators, so that each case
could be evaluated as carefully and
quickly as possible. The Student Ju
dicial Charter states: "All members
of the Stanford community are in
vited to propose suggestions about
modification of judicial procedures
to the Board." As a member of this
community I ask that Stanford
strengthen current policies and give
out sanctions that reflect the magni
tude of the violations committed by
students found responsible for sex
ual assault.
Students at Columbia, Harvard
and Brown have all encouraged sen
iors to wear strips of red tape on
their graduation caps to acknowl
edge that there is a serious issue on
their campuses and demand their
respective administrations amend
insufficient policies. I invite all
members of the senior class to join
me in wearing red tape on our caps
at commencement to support sur
vivors of sexual assault and to en
courage Stanford to do the same.

Sexual assault on college cam
puses, a topic normally sur
rounded by a culture of si
lence, has become headline news.
This is a national issue, and Stan
ford, while idealized as a palm-lined
paradise, is not exempt from reality:
sexual assault happens everywhere.
Although Stanford has avoided the
federal investigations and public
scrutiny directed at other institu
tions, our university's policies re
garding sexual violence are just as
critically flawed. As one survivor ex
pressed to me, "When Stanford told
me how it was sanctioning the man
it found responsible for forcibly sex
ually assaulting me, I felt totally
helpless."
The Stanford Alternate Review
Process (ARP) is Stanford's process
for adjudication regarding student
on student altercations, but most
students found responsible for sex
ual assault by the ARP have not
faced any significant consequences
for their actions. According to
tenured Stanford Law professor
Michele Dauber, head of the Board
of Judicial Affairs from 2011-2013,
between 2005 and 2011, nine stu
dents were found responsible for
sexual assault and one student was
expelled. The other eight students
received suspensions ranging from
1-8 quarters, sometimes including
other restrictions such as housing
bans, mandatory education and/or
community service.
Professor Dauber believes that
"expulsion is the appropriate sanc
tion for sexual assault, unless there
are highly unusual mitigating cir
cumstances. The purposes of the
Fundamental Standard and the
Penalty Code can only be carried
out if there is accountability." I
agree and believe that the only way
to hold students accountable is to
expel those parties found responsi
ble for forcible sexual assault.
Sexual assault is a problem on
our campus. A survey presented to
the Faculty Senate in 2013 noted
that out of the 175 reported sexual
assaults between 1997 and 2009,
only four students chose to pursue
cases for evaluation by Judicial Af
fairs (now known as The Office of
Community Standards), and only in
two of those cases was the accused
party found responsible.
Stanford's current ARI) suppos
edly meant to improve accountabili
ty, is a drastic but toothless im
provement. In general, the channels
presently available to student sur
vivors seeking penalties for their ac
cused assailants include filing cases

with the ARP and/or under Title IX.
But at Stanford, the only way to dis
cipline a responsible party is to file a
case with ARE A student cannot be
suspended or expelled through Title
IX at Stanford because of the Stu
dent Judicial Charter, which pro
vides a specific judicial process
prior to any and all disciplinary ac
tion, relegating survivors to the
ARP if they want to see their ac
cused attackers penalized in any
way.
Despite a parallel increase in the
number of ARP cases and parties
found responsible, most students
found to have committed sexual as
sault or misconduct are allowed to
complete their education with illu
sory and mostly confidential conse
quences. It is no surprise to me that
a survivor would question going
through the ARI) a difficult and
lengthy ordeal that delivers only the
legal equivalent of a slap on the
wrist even in cases of forcible
rape. In addition to going through
the trauma of having their stories
picked apart and questioned, sur
vivors are expected to be high-per
forming students at a rigorous insti
tution, oftentimes knowing that
even if the responding party is
found responsible, that student will
still have the privilege of attending
and graduating from Stanford. One
ARP case, currently underway, has
already taken Stanford more than
twice the 60-day ARP timeline rec
ommendation to resolve. That case
has lasted about five months,
spanned two quarters and derailed
the academic life of the rape sur
vivor involved. I will not attempt to
put into words the emotional toll
shouldered by survivors of sexual
assault.
Students who are found respon
sible and are allowed to reintegrate
back into the Stanford community
threaten the safety of the student
survivor as well as other members
of the Stanford community. A stu
dent found responsible for sexual
assault could be sitting next to you
in lecture or mixing you a drink on
Friday night. The responsible
party's confidentiality is protected,
while the survivor and other mem
bers of the community are not. Stu
dents need to be held accountable
for their actions because only
through accountability can a person
responsible of sexual assault under
stand that what they did was wrong.
So what's being done about this?
It takes engaged student leader
ship, responses to Federal Policy
and the adoption of the best prae

tices spearheaded by universities
moving to increase student safety.
