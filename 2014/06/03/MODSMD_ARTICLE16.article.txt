The year 1984 may not have seen
perpetual global war between
three superstates as it did in
the novel of the same name, but 1984
was the year that the first prison was
transferred to private operation.
Since then, the private prison indus
try has grown massively, fueled by
the violent crime epidemic of the 'Bos,
the "War on Drugs" and public policy
changes, like legislatively-mandated
long minimum sentences for all sorts
of crimes. As a result of these trends,
the United States now has the dubi
ous honor of the highest incarcera
tion rate in the world: 0.74 percent of
Americans are in the prison popula
tion, 2.3 million people in all.
Some of the players in this bur
geoning private prison industry have
grown massive: the Corrections Cor
poration of America employed ap
proximately 16,750 in 2011, with $2.6
billion in assets and $1.7 billion in rev
enue. Today, private facilities house 8
percent of all state and federal pris
ons, and the industry sees strong
growth.
Private prisons have attracted a
great deal of controversy and criti
cism. The cost savings touted by pri
vate sector advocates have failed to
materialize through our country's ex

periment with private prison opera
tion: Private detention centers have
generally cost as much to operate as
conventional state-run prisons, even
though private prisons tend to incar
cerate healthier, lower maintenance
inmates. Meanwhile, journalists and
prisoner advocates alike have uncov
ered a litany of cases of neglect and
understaffed facilities leading to poor
inmate conditions: For instance, the
Corrections Corporation of Ameri
ca's Idaho Correctional Center
recorded over three times as many
inmate-on-inmate assaults as did the
equally-large but state-run Idaho
State Correctional Institution.
Worse, in the "kids for cash" scandal,
two judges in Luzerne County, Penn
sylvania were investigated and in
dicted for accepting bribes from a
private juvenile detention operator in
exchange for defunding the county
owned juvenile center and sending
kids to the private facility for trivial
offenses.
However, private prisons are not
simply equally inefficient and some
what less safe analogues of their
state-run counterparts. As I've stud
ied the issue, I now believe that pri
