## Gates Foundation: In support of divesting from G4S 
### Peter Johnston 
The year 1984 may not have seen
perpetual global war between
three superstates as it did in
the novel of the same name, but 1984
was the year that the first prison was
transferred to private operation.
Since then, the private prison indus
try has grown massively, fueled by
the violent crime epidemic of the 'Bos,
the "War on Drugs" and public policy
changes, like legislatively-mandated
long minimum sentences for all sorts
of crimes. As a result of these trends,
the United States now has the dubi
ous honor of the highest incarcera
tion rate in the world: 0.74 percent of
Americans are in the prison popula
tion, 2.3 million people in all.
Some of the players in this bur
geoning private prison industry have
grown massive: the Corrections Cor
poration of America employed ap
proximately 16,750 in 2011, with $2.6
billion in assets and $1.7 billion in rev
enue. Today, private facilities house 8
percent of all state and federal pris
ons, and the industry sees strong
growth.
Private prisons have attracted a
great deal of controversy and criti
cism. The cost savings touted by pri
vate sector advocates have failed to
materialize through our country's ex

periment with private prison opera
tion: Private detention centers have
generally cost as much to operate as
conventional state-run prisons, even
though private prisons tend to incar
cerate healthier, lower maintenance
inmates. Meanwhile, journalists and
prisoner advocates alike have uncov
ered a litany of cases of neglect and
understaffed facilities leading to poor
inmate conditions: For instance, the
Corrections Corporation of Ameri
ca's Idaho Correctional Center
recorded over three times as many
inmate-on-inmate assaults as did the
equally-large but state-run Idaho
State Correctional Institution.
Worse, in the "kids for cash" scandal,
two judges in Luzerne County, Penn
sylvania were investigated and in
dicted for accepting bribes from a
private juvenile detention operator in
exchange for defunding the county
owned juvenile center and sending
kids to the private facility for trivial
offenses.
However, private prisons are not
simply equally inefficient and some
what less safe analogues of their
state-run counterparts. As I've stud
ied the issue, I now believe that pri
vate prison corporations represent a
tangible and dangerous threat to
democracy and liberty everywhere
they operate.
Why is this the case?
Private prison corporations, like
other publicly-owned corporations,
are generally expected to continually
grow in order to uphold their fiduci
ary duty to their shareholders. For
private prison operators, this means
both taking charge of state-held in
mates as well as working to increase
America's sky-high incarceration
rate. In a pluralist policymaking sys
tem such as ours, this duty creates a
tremendous hazard.
The private prison industry, a
large, moneyed interest that repre
sents tens of thousands of jobs, has a
strong financial incentive to increase
the frequency and length of prison
sentences and to oppose criminal
sentencing reforms. In other words,

these private prison operators profit
tremendously by advocating and pe
titioning for policy that curtails indi
vidual citizen's liberty. The Correc
tional Coiporation of America ac
knowledges the threat of criminal
justice reform to its bottom line in its
2012 Securities and Exchange Com
mission filing: "The demand for our
facilities and services could be ad
versely affected by the relaxation of
enforcement efforts, leniency in con
viction or parole standards and sen
tencing practices or through the de
criminalization of certain activities
that are currently proscribed by
criminal laws." This is incredibly per
ilous.
This critique is not limited to pri
vate prisons: Other industries and
corporations that tend to profit from
unethical public policy are equally
dangerous. For instance, Academi
(nee Blackwater) and other private
military companies generate a great
amount of business when the United
States creates overseas war zones.
Blackwater itself earned more than
slb in contracts during the Bush Ad
ministration until being banned from

Iraq in 2009. These enterprises thus
have the financial incentive to peti
tion for belligerent foreign policy,
even when conflict escalation is not in
the interests of the American public
or the world. The Los Angeles Times
has described a revolving door con
necting industry lobbyists and advo
cacy of conflict-related policies.
Thus, I support the Stanford
campaign calling for the Bill &
Melinda Gates Foundation to divest
from its $172 million investment in
G4S, the world's largest security
company and a large presence in the
private prison sector. While Gates
has sold some shares in G4S, the
Foundation still may or may not re
tain a stake in the company. If the
Foundation wishes to meet its phil
anthropic mission of ending poverty,
it should invest its tremendous as
sets in away that does not pose a
threat to the lives and liberty of all
people of the world.
