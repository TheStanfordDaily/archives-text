## Daniel Wright Divestment and its discontents 
### 
To the Editor:
Divestment seems to be the new
activist fad. Stanford needs to di
vest from fossil fuel companies.
The Gates Foundation needs to
divest from This is now the
"cause" for which elections are held
and petitions are signed. This move
ment, however well-intentioned, is a
new high point in activist naivete.
One major problem with so
called "ethical investing" is that in
an institution as large as Stanford,
there are disagreements about what
is ethical and what is not. When
Stanford divested from coal mining
companies and threatened to go fur
ther, it alienated a large share of stu
dents and faculty who had no qualms
with fossil fuel companies compa
nies that provide abundant, cheap
energy without which our economy
would not function. But who is right
on the issue is not the point; the point
is that there are two sides within
Stanford on the issue. And Stanford
chose to use its endowment to make
a political statement, endorse one
group's opinion and simultaneously
denounce the other's. (And it seems
that more than anything, Stanford's
choice was a petty move to look "bet
ter" than Harvard.)
That is not the purpose of an en
dowment.
The true purpose of an endow
ment, like it or not, is to make money.
It is not to make political state
ments. It is not to endorse one opin
ion over another. It has one purpose
and one purpose alone: make
money. Nothing else should factor
into the decision-making, however
much you personally find making
money repugnant.
Consider, moreover, what divest
ing does: nothing, besides making a
little statement and cutting off our
nose to spite our face. Does Exxon-
Mobil care whether Stanford is an

investor? Absolutely not. Its stock is
bought and sold all the time. All di
vesting means is that Stanford sells
it stock to someone else who wants
it. All it can do is hurt the divestor, if
its returns suffer, and with a set of
profitable options having been elim
inated, presumably they will. Fur
thermore, divesting gives up the di
vestor's voice in the company from
which he has divested. Shareholders
control the company. When those
shares are sold, so is the control
within that company and the only
hope of changing the company from
within.

Ultimately, the divestment
movement is a cop-out. It is away
for some people to feel self-right
eous without having to do anything.
Students can celebrate that Stan
ford divested from coal without
having to make any real changes in
their lives. The investors in
Peabody Energy Corp. may
change, but that company mines
coal just the same as it always has.
If the divestment protestors really
believed in their cause, they would
n't even be divestment protestors
instead, they would be working
harder to reduce their own fossil
fuel consumption. If the G4S pro
testors actually cared about human
rights, they would be trying to pro
tect human rights instead of chang
ing the investors in a security com
pany, a goal which does absolutely
nothing for human rights.
There are many reasons to ques
tion the causes of today's activists,
but it's quite clear that divestment
movements are not movements for
any real cause that could be ques
tioned â€” they're here because of
laziness, stupidity, or both.
