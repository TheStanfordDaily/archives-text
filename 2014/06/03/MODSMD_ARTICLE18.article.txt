# OP-ED
## Seeking meaning and purpose at Stanford 
### Sharon Tan 
"11 IT eaning is not something
\/l you stumble across ...
-LY_l_ Meaning is something
you build into your life." This quote
from John W Gardner adorns the
notebooks that the Haas Center re
cently gave out at a senior send-off
event. But does Stanford teach us to
build meaning? To what extent are
students asking themselves ques
tions like, "Why am I here? What is
my purpose? What do I deeply be
lieve in? Who am I?" Less than 12
months ago, I embarked on an hon
ors thesis to study how Stanford
students pursued questions of
meaning and purpose.
I based my research off of a land
mark longitudinal survey by Astin,
Astin and Lindholm (2011), who
studied how college affected stu
dents' spiritual growth. They de
scribed the concept of "Spiritual
Quest," defined by Klaassen and
McDonald (2002) as a form of exis
tential engagement that empha
sizes individual purpose and mean
ing-making in the world. Since
many of us understand spirituality
very differently, the relevant ques
tion was not whether ideas of mean
ing and purpose were necessarily
spiritual, but whether they were rel
evant, and how. I interviewed a sam
ple of convenience of 39 upperclass
men. Here are four main take
aways:
1. Process
Many respondents described
going through a major life event
that catalyzed their process of re
flection on meaning and purpose.
These events were more often neg
ative than positive, including the
death of a loved one. Other less dra
matic experiences included being
severely challenged academically or
forced to choose a major. Often, par
ticipants experienced unusual ad
versity, which provoked them to
consider the meaning of life and de
velop their life philosophies.
Participants often reported that
after these catalytic events, they
gained a deeper sense of surrender
and faith in that the occurrences of
the world are not and do not need to
be in their immediate control and
that things would turn out all right.
They described mindset changes
such as an increased emphasis on
self-love and compassion for other
people. While the process does not
end, some participants reached
places of stability where questions
of meaning were no longer as press
ing and stressful as before. There
were also those to whom these ques
tions had never been important.
2. Obstacles
Participants described the Stan
ford culture of busyness, pressure,
stress, overachievement and mate

rialism as the main impediment to
their thinking about meaning and
purpose. They referred to the pow
erful narratives of success that sur
rounded them, and pointed out that
the demanding schedule of dead
lines and commitments took time
away from reflection, slowing down,
or even thinking. Some respon
dents reported feeling pressure to
do more and achieve more, not to
consider the meaning and puipose
of what they were doing, nor to ask
themselves critically why they were
doing what they were doing.
3. Supports
When I asked participants what
supported them in thinking about
meaning, they mostly spoke not of
their advisors, faculty members or
classes, but of their friends at Stan
ford. Friends who were supportive
and who engaged in deep conversa
tions with them were most helpful.
This could backfire if one's friends
did not appreciate this kind of in
quiry. Other resources included
Counseling and Psychological Serv
ices (CAPS), student groups, study
abroad, Design Your Life and the
Office of Religious Life.
4. Gaps
Many participants wanted more
opportunities to discuss such mat
ters, such as secular "small groups,"
stronger student communities in
residences or a better-resourced
spiritual community center. Be
cause respondents conceived of
ideas of meaning and purpose very
differently, their suggestions for im
provement also varied widely. For
example, for a person whose sense
of meaning is completely bound up
in their job search, a more accessi
ble Career Development Center
would be helpful. Yet this desire is
irrelevant to another person who
wanted stronger adult mentors,
having had a frustrating advising
experience at Stanford.
The upshot is this: Kf you have
thought critically about your educa
tion and sought meaningful experi
ences, you are not alone. The
process may feel terrible, but give it
time. Try talking to your friends.
There are resources here that can
help you. At the same time, we need
a greater range of interventions de
signed at facilitating students' spir
itual growth that can help us consid
er what living well means to us indi
vidually and why amid the
endless opportunity that we enjoy
at Stanford.

and who engaged in deep conversa

This could backfire if one's friends
did not appreciate this kind of in

Counseling and Psychological Serv

4. Gaps
Many participants wanted more
opportunities to discuss such mat
ters, such as secular "small groups,"
stronger student communities in
residences or a better-resourced
spiritual community center. Be
cause respondents conceived of
ideas of meaning and purpose very
differently, their suggestions for im
provement also varied widely. For
example, for a person whose sense
of meaning is completely bound up
in their job search, a more accessi

would be helpful. Yet this desire is
irrelevant to another person who
wanted stronger adult mentors,
having had a frustrating advising
experience at Stanford.
The upshot is this: Kf you have
thought critically about your educa

ences, you are not alone. The
process may feel terrible, but give it
time. Try talking to your friends.
There are resources here that can
help you. At the same time, we need
a greater range of interventions de
signed at facilitating students' spir
itual growth that can help us consid
er what living well means to us indi
vidually and why amid the
endless opportunity that we enjoy
at Stanford.

"11 IT eaning is not something
\/l you stumble across ...
-LY_l_ Meaning is something
you build into your life." This quote
from John W Gardner adorns the
notebooks that the Haas Center re
cently gave out at a senior send-off
event. But does Stanford teach us to
build meaning? To what extent are
students asking themselves ques
tions like, "Why am I here? What is
my purpose? What do I deeply be
lieve in? Who am I?" Less than 12
months ago, I embarked on an hon
ors thesis to study how Stanford
students pursued questions of
meaning and purpose.
I based my research off of a land
mark longitudinal survey by Astin,
Astin and Lindholm (2011), who
studied how college affected stu
dents' spiritual growth. They de
scribed the concept of "Spiritual
Quest," defined by Klaassen and
McDonald (2002) as a form of exis
tential engagement that empha
sizes individual purpose and mean
ing-making in the world. Since
many of us understand spirituality
very differently, the relevant ques
tion was not whether ideas of mean
ing and purpose were necessarily
spiritual, but whether they were rel
evant, and how. I interviewed a sam
ple of convenience of 39 upperclass
men. Here are four main take
aways:
1. Process
Many respondents described
going through a major life event
that catalyzed their process of re
flection on meaning and purpose.
These events were more often neg
ative than positive, including the
death of a loved one. Other less dra
matic experiences included being
severely challenged academically or
forced to choose a major. Often, par
ticipants experienced unusual ad
versity, which provoked them to
consider the meaning of life and de
velop their life philosophies.
Participants often reported that
after these catalytic events, they
gained a deeper sense of surrender
and faith in that the occurrences of
the world are not and do not need to
be in their immediate control and
that things would turn out all right.
They described mindset changes
such as an increased emphasis on
self-love and compassion for other
people. While the process does not
end, some participants reached
places of stability where questions
of meaning were no longer as press
ing and stressful as before. There
were also those to whom these ques
tions had never been important.
2. Obstacles
Participants described the Stan
ford culture of busyness, pressure,
stress, overachievement and mate

rialism as the main impediment to
their thinking about meaning and
purpose. They referred to the pow
erful narratives of success that sur
rounded them, and pointed out that
the demanding schedule of dead
lines and commitments took time
away from reflection, slowing down,
or even thinking. Some respon
dents reported feeling pressure to
do more and achieve more, not to
consider the meaning and puipose
of what they were doing, nor to ask
themselves critically why they were
doing what they were doing.
3. Supports
When I asked participants what
supported them in thinking about
meaning, they mostly spoke not of
their advisors, faculty members or
classes, but of their friends at Stan
ford. Friends who were supportive
and who engaged in deep conversa
tions with them were most helpful.
This could backfire if one's friends
did not appreciate this kind of in
quiry. Other resources included
Counseling and Psychological Serv
ices (CAPS), student groups, study
abroad, Design Your Life and the
Office of Religious Life.
