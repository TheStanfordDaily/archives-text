# OP-ED
## Frost Festival: A response to the Women's Community Center 
### Stanford Concert Network 
To Whom It May Concern:

The Stanford Concert Network
(SCN) would like to respond to the
Op-Ed piece, "Frost Festival ices
women out: an open letter to the
Stanford Concert Network" that ap
peared in The Stanford Daily on Fri
day, May 16.
Lack of representation of women
and people of color in the music in
dustry is a major issue, and one that
extends far beyond Stanford Univer
sity. Major music festivals have re
peatedly been criticized for then- lack
of female representation; on average
just over 15 percent of Coachella line
ups have been female. Music festi
vals, however, have a responsibility to
their fiscal sponsors and their audi
ences to book the artists that are
most popular, regardless of gender.
Therefore, when considering the rep
resentation of women at maj or music
festivals, we should not be pointing
fingers at individual promoters, but
instead asking larger questions
about how and why women are
drawn to the music industry and why
they do not reach popularity in the
same numbers that men do.
The accusations raised in "Frost
Festival ices women out" of the Stan
ford Concert Network and Frost
Music Festival are misguided and in
accurate. Each year when booking

Frost, we create a survey of artists
that members of SCN would like to
see at the festival. From this list we
poll the student body and then pur
sue artists, starting with the group
that received the most votes. We
often cannot book our top few choic
es because they are unavailable or
too expensive. This year's Frost
Music and Arts Festival featured
Paper Void, a diverse group that per
formed with Stephanie Mae, a fe
male singer/songwriter, as their lead
vocalist. We also pursued many acts
with female headliners including
CHVRCHES, Grimes, The Head
and the Heart and HAIM, who un
fortunately were unavailable or
turned down our offers.
The Stanford Concert Network
has an interest in representing the
musical interests and pursuits of
everyone on campus regardless of
their gender, race or ethnicity and
actively tries to book a diversity of
artists for our many annual shows.
We have organized and co-spon
sored 25 shows this year alone, rep
resenting genres ranging from jazz
to rock to hip hop, as well as various
sub-genres in electronic music.
Frost is but one of these. Artists
we've brought to campus in the past
two years include Bleached, Trails
and Ways, Megan Slankard,
Gabriela Leslie, Zion I, Casual,

gLAdiator and Kaytranada; all of
these acts are women or people of
color. Current SCN members are
also in the midst of organizing our
annual winter hip-hop show an
initiative taken by members at the
start of the academic year with
the intention of diversifying music
genres represented on campus.
The authors of "Frost Festival
ices out women" state that the re
vival of Frost fails the festival's tra
dition of equal rights advocacy, polit
ical activism and social justice. We
would like to correct the notion that
Frost is or ever was intended to be a
medium to advance activist agendas,
or that it is a cultural/ethnic show
case. The mission of the Stanford
Concert Network has always been
to celebrate music and the arts;
nothing more, nothing less.
We encourage any readers inter
ested in furthering this conversation
or increasing the diversity of music
available on campus to join SCN.
Our meetings are open to the public
and held at 9:30 p.m. in 808 on
Tuesdays.
Sincerely,
The Stanford Concert Network
