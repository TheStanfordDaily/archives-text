## It's time to eliminate legacy preference in Stanford admissions 
### Jonathan Poto 
This April, when Stanford re
leased its admissions statistics,
most celebrated was that our
admit rate had dropped to 5.07 per
cent, below every Ivy League univer
sity. It certainly is a blessing that we
are able to pick one out of 20 students
from a body 0f42,167 applicants. With
such a rich talent pool to select and
places at Stanford scarce, it is wrong
to offer a preferential admissions
process to legacy applicants due to
their extrinsic and class-defined char
acteristics of having a parent or step
parent with a graduate or undergrad
uate degree from Stanford.
Let me clarify what legacy prefer
ence is. The article "What it Takes" in
the November/December 2013 issue
of Stanford Magazine said the follow
ing: "[Dean of Admissions Richard]
Shaw is a strong advocate for consid
ering legacy status in the overall stu
dent assessment, but emphasizes that
it is only relevant if the student is com
petitive in all other aspects."
This sound reasonable, since if all
things are equal, why shouldn't
Stanford extend this opportunity to
a person already "in the Stanford
family"? Another line in this article
put this sentiment into question, how
ever: "It used to be that every applica
tion would be read twice. Now, only
one reading is guaranteed, although
thanks, Mom and Dad every
legacy application still gets two sets of
eyes." This means that regardless of
the quality of an application, a legacy
applicant gets a second opportunity to
state his case to the admissions board.
Legacy preferences force our al
ready overloaded admit personnel to
evaluate legacy students vs. non-lega
cies through an asymmetric process,
measuring the intrinsic qualities of
non-legacies such as their critical
thinking and writing skills against
both the intrinsic and extrinsic
qualities of legacy applicants. While it
could be argued that there are asym
metries involved when evaluating any
non-academic variables such as musi
cal talent, athletic skill, difficult life
circumstances or any other number
of potential variables, I argue that
these at least involve some level of
personal development and imply the
overcoming of obstacles by the appli
cant, unlike legacy status. Rirther
more, comparisons become even
more challenging when Stanford's
admissions officers may collectively
have only one opportunity to look at a
standard application, but two chances
to read a legacy application.

How much of an effect does legacy
preference actually have on admis
sions? In a 2011 study by Michael
Hurwitz of 30 selective colleges, his
experiments showed that legacy ap
plicants enjoyed an average 23.3 per
cent boost in admission rates after
controlling for SAT scores, personal
statement quality and the strength of
teacher recommendations. In the
September/October 2013 issue of
Stanford Magazine, President Hen
nessy stated, "As for alumni children,
even thought he admissions rate for
them is two or three times higher than
the general population, it's still very
tough to get in." Assuming the medi
an of President Hennessy's estimat
ed legacy admit rate, or 2.5 times the
general admit rate (12.5 percent), this
means the legacy acceptance rate
would drop to about 10 percent. If 10
percent of Stanford's Class of 2018 is
currently made up of legacies (equal,
for example, to the proportion of lega
cies at Brown University, according to
their Dean of Admissions Jim Miller),
it follows that approximately 173
as opposed to 213 legacy students
would be admitted.
Who are these approximately 40
students per year who would other
wise not be accepted? We can't speak
specifically, but the makeup of legacy
applicants is largely from the upper
income brackets. Stanford alumni go
on to be far more economically suc
cessful than the general population,
with an average mid-career salary of
$114,000 versus the $51,017 national
median household income. This
means that applications from under
privileged students students who
have already overcome the chal
lenges of getting a fee-waiver or sav
ing money just to apply to Stanford
face an added barrier of competing
against typically upper-income lega
cy-preference applications. I believe
this stark reality is a strong argument
against this form of plutocracy.
I propose that to end this plutocra
cy, we should take a first step of re
moving the rule that legacy applica
tions will be read twice. Eventually, I
hope that we can completely remove
the field on the application that lets
you write in your relatives that went

to Stanford. Moreover, I hope that we
can promote a dialogue about what
our admissions process should look
like, examining how we should deal
with the various incomparable in
trinsic qualities that we also select
our students for (such as the exam
ples I mentioned above, including so
cioeconomic status, athletic ability
and so on and so forth). This is an im
portant dialogue that needs to re
shape itself over time, as I believe it
must radically do right now.
To some practical concerns. Will
Stanford's endowment suffer if we
turn away the grandchildren of
wealthy alumni donors such as John
Arrillaga ($l5l million in 2013), or if
we replace tuition ($56,411 per year)
from wealthier legacies with financial
aid packages? Although the extra
money does fund financial aid and
teacher salaries and infrastructure
improvements, my response is,
"Should we care?" When the Board of
Trustees quoted our Statement on In
vestment Responsibility (1971), say
ing that they would stop investment
in coal companies since the endow
ment should not invest in "corporate
policies or practices that create sub
stantial social injury," they confirmed
that we should not acquiesce to finan
cial ends when it severely compromis
es our values. We should extend sim
ilar protections to the ideal of meri
tocracy that a liberal education
such as Stanford's is supposed to
espouse.
As President Hennessy said to
Stanford Magazine, "For every stu
dent who gets in, we turn down two or
three who are just as good." The prob
lem is that by choosing 40 legacy ap
plicants every year as opposed to the
40 who would otherwise get those
spots, we say to every single one of
those "just as good" students that
maybe they could've gotten into Stan
ford, if only they had been born with
the correct, Stanford, upper-class ac
cent.
