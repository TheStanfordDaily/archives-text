## Rittman resigns after 18 years 
### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford softball head coach
John Rittman has resigned his posi
tion after leading the Cardinal for
18 seasons. The announcement was
made by Stanford Athletic Director
Bernard Muir on Monday.
Both before and after Rittman's
resignation, there have been allega
tions on social media of wrongdoing
on the coach's part.
Associate Vice President for
University Communications Lisa
Lapin said Monday that the Univer
sity was unable to comment on per
sonnel matters.
Rittman became the second
head coach in program history in
1997. Tasked with establishing the
Card's position among the elite in
the nation's premier softball confer
ence, Rittman helped the Cardinal
to its first 30-win season in his first
year. Prom there, the Stanford soft
ball program rose to the top of the
college softball landscape, with the
Card making 16 consecutive ap
pearances in the N CAA tournament
from 1998 through 2013.
Stanford reached the Women's
College World Series, the pinnacle
of collegiate softball, twice under
Rittman's leadership in 2001 and
2004; the Cardinal made it to the
semifinals of the World Series in
both trips to Oklahoma City, falling
to powerhouses Arizona and UCLA,
respectively. After the introduction
of a three-round N CAA tournament
in 2005, the Card also qualified for
five Super Regionals in a seven

year stretch from 2005 through
2011.
However, since a loss in the 2011
Super Regional to Alabama, Stan
ford has not been able to advance
past the regional round of the
NCAA tournament. At least a half
dozen players have left the team
since 2011, hurting the Card's
depth. The 2014 softball season was
a particularly trying campaign for
the Cardinal players, as a transfer,
an injury and a medical leave deci
mated the pitching rotation.
In the summer before the start
of the 2014 season, then-rising soph
omore Kelsey Stevens transferred
to Oklahoma. Stanford's staff was
further depleted by a season-ending
injury to freshman Carley Hoover,
which cut short her season after
only eight games. Finally, junior
Nyree White left the squad to take a
medical leave of absence in early
February.
In the end, the Cardinal could
not overcome these roster losses,
stumbling to their worst season in
nearly two decades. In the process,
Stanford missed the postseason for
the first time since 1997. The Card
also finished without a conference
series win for the first time since
1995. For a program accustomed to
success, the recent downturn has
left supporters of the team search
ing for answers.
The softball program will con
duct a national search to find a new
head coach for the 2015 season.
