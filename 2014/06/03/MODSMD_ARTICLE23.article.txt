# THE
						BRAINS OF STANFORD BASEBALL

### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Every baseball player dreams of
reaching the major leagues. From
little league to high school to college,
the ultimate goal remains the same:
to hear your name called in the
MLB draft and ascend to the major
league level.
However, unlike most American
sports leagues, the MLB dream is
not completed on the day of the
draft. Those who are drafted in the
first round of the NBA and NFL
drafts are virtually guaranteed at
least a year or two with their respec
tive teams and play at the highest
level in their first year. It's unheard
of for a first-round pick in the NBA
and NFL to never don the team's
uniform for at least a single game.
In baseball, though, the reality is
much different. Only 73 percent of
first-round picks in the MLB draft
ever play a day in the major leagues,
with the other 27 percent becoming
career minor league players. Con
sidering all rounds, only one in six
players selected in the MLB draft
will ever make it to the maj or league
level, and one in 20 draftees will be
come "regulars," or someone who
plays for three years or more.
Adding to the difficulty, once a
baseball player reaches the big
leagues, he cannot become a free
agent and competitively negotiate a
contract until six years have passed,
potentially after the prime of his ca
reer. As such, although the MLB
has become known for the mega
contracts of Alex Rodriguez, Albert
Pujols and others, only about half
(378 of 750 players) of the players
make $2 million or more per season.
The odds of becoming an estab
lished major leaguer are slim at
best, even if a player is drafted. Yet
despite the likely need for a career
change, college degrees are rare
finds among professional baseball
players. According to the College
Sport Research Institute, college
baseball players graduate at rates
31.29 percent lower than the aver
age male graduation rate. Pac-12
players, meanwhile, graduate at

rates 44.3 percent lower than the
Pac-12's average male graduation
rate. Additionally, only 4.3 percent
of MLB players have a college de
gree.
Despite the success of NCAA
student-athletes graduating as a
whole, college baseball remains
troubled with graduation issues due
to the fact that college baseball play
ers can be drafted and leave after
their junior years, similarly to in col
lege football. Yet unlike football
players, the baseball players that
leave early after being drafted may
never play a day in the big leagues.

Over 20 years ago, Stanford
baseball head coach Mark Marquess
recognized that something needed

to change.
"The two guys where I really
changed my theory were Jeffrey
Hammonds and Ed Sprague," Mar
quess shared. "Both were first
round picks and both were in the big
leagues within a year and a half and
both played for years in the big
leagues, but both didn't get their
Stanford degrees because when
you're a position player and you go
out and play in the summer, they
want you to go to winter league or
they want you to go to instructional
ball and they pay you a million dol
lars so you can't say no.
"All of a sudden you never get a
chance to go back to school and

conversation with Stanford's athletic directors on how to get players
their degrees efficiently despite leaving their junior year for the pros.

Junior Austin Slater (above) could be a potential early-round MLB draft pick this week. Slater was drafted
out of high school to the LA Dodgers but turned down the offer in order to play for the Stanford Cardinal.
