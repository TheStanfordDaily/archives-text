# THE 						BRAINS OF STANFORD BASEBALL
## 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Every baseball player dreams of
reaching the major leagues. From
little league to high school to college,
the ultimate goal remains the same:
to hear your name called in the
MLB draft and ascend to the major
league level.
However, unlike most American
sports leagues, the MLB dream is
not completed on the day of the
draft. Those who are drafted in the
first round of the NBA and NFL
drafts are virtually guaranteed at
least a year or two with their respec
tive teams and play at the highest
level in their first year. It's unheard
of for a first-round pick in the NBA
and NFL to never don the team's
uniform for at least a single game.
In baseball, though, the reality is
much different. Only 73 percent of
first-round picks in the MLB draft
ever play a day in the major leagues,
with the other 27 percent becoming
career minor league players. Con
sidering all rounds, only one in six
players selected in the MLB draft
will ever make it to the maj or league
level, and one in 20 draftees will be
come "regulars," or someone who
plays for three years or more.
Adding to the difficulty, once a
baseball player reaches the big
leagues, he cannot become a free
agent and competitively negotiate a
contract until six years have passed,
potentially after the prime of his ca
reer. As such, although the MLB
has become known for the mega
contracts of Alex Rodriguez, Albert
Pujols and others, only about half
(378 of 750 players) of the players
make $2 million or more per season.
The odds of becoming an estab
lished major leaguer are slim at
best, even if a player is drafted. Yet
despite the likely need for a career
change, college degrees are rare
finds among professional baseball
players. According to the College
Sport Research Institute, college
baseball players graduate at rates
31.29 percent lower than the aver
age male graduation rate. Pac-12
players, meanwhile, graduate at

rates 44.3 percent lower than the
Pac-12's average male graduation
rate. Additionally, only 4.3 percent
of MLB players have a college de
gree.
Despite the success of NCAA
student-athletes graduating as a
whole, college baseball remains
troubled with graduation issues due
to the fact that college baseball play
ers can be drafted and leave after
their junior years, similarly to in col
lege football. Yet unlike football
players, the baseball players that
leave early after being drafted may
never play a day in the big leagues.

Over 20 years ago, Stanford
baseball head coach Mark Marquess
recognized that something needed

to change.
"The two guys where I really
changed my theory were Jeffrey
Hammonds and Ed Sprague," Mar
quess shared. "Both were first
round picks and both were in the big
leagues within a year and a half and
both played for years in the big
leagues, but both didn't get their
Stanford degrees because when
you're a position player and you go
out and play in the summer, they
want you to go to winter league or
they want you to go to instructional
ball and they pay you a million dol
lars so you can't say no.
"All of a sudden you never get a
chance to go back to school and

Junior Austin Slater (above) could be a potential early-round MLB draft pick this week. Slater was drafted
out of high school to the LA Dodgers but turned down the offer in order to play for the Stanford Cardinal.
you're in the big leagues, you've made
a lot of money, so you don't really need
[the degree], but I said, 'what a sin
that you go there for three years and
you don't get your Stanford degree,"'
he added.
Hammonds, the fourth overall
pick in the 1992 Draft by the Balti
more Orioles and recent Stanford
Hall of Fame inductee, and Sprague,
the 25th overall pick in the 1988 Draft
by the Toronto Blue Jays, both defied
the odds and lasted past their first six
years in the major leagues and were
able to negotiate free-agent con
tracts. A .272 lifetime hitter with 110
home runs over his 13-year career,
Hammonds made more than enough
money to provide for himself and his
family. Similarly, Sprague's 11-year
career saw him hit 152 home runs.
But when then careers ended in then
mid-to-late 30s, what came next?
"When [Hammonds] was with the
Giants towards the end of his career,
he came over and met with his advisor
or somebody in his department and
figured out what he needed to gradu
ate," Marquess said. "He got out of
baseball and lived in Florida with his
wife and a couple young kids. He
would fly out here Sunday night, rent
ed a townhouse in Palo Alto and flew
home on Thursday to come back and
get his degree."
Indeed, Hammonds returned to
Stanford and earned his degree over
a decade after he originally attended
the university but not without obsta
cles. Not only was he years removed
from taking classes, but he had a fam
ily to care for.
"He's the guy that I changed [the
program for] because it was unfair,"
Marquess said. "He was on time [to
graduate] but he had to come back
and get his degree. I'm really proud of
him."
In the 19905, Marquess began
talks with Stanford's athletic advisors
to determine what could be done to
prevent Hammonds' situation from

reoccurring and to help players get
their college degrees even if they
chose to leave after then* junior sea
sons. A plan was quickly struck that
consisted of Stanford baseball play
ers taking an extra class during their
fall or winter quarters, or both, to get
ahead. That way, by the time then
junior year ended, baseball players
would be at least a quarter ahead and
would only need two more quarters,
at most, to complete then* degrees.
This plan has been in action ever
since.
'A typical fall is somewhere be
tween 18 and 20 units, winter is some
where between 16 and 20 units, de
pending on what year you are, and
usually freshman try to take closer to
20," said junior outfielder Austin
Slater. "Then during spring usually
it's 12 to 15 units, somewhere in
there."
Marquess' academic strategy has
been wildly successful since it was ini
tially instituted. Every Stanford
baseball player is required to be at
least a quarter ahead by the end of his
junior year, leaving only two quarters
left to complete his degree.
If a player then leaves after his
junior year for the MLB draft, which
has become a common trend through
out college baseball, the amount of
classes left to earn his degree would
be cut down by at least an entire quar
ter. This is a significant amount to a
professional baseball player when the
fall and winter are so valuable for in
structional offseason baseball that
might be required for minor leaguers
and the spring and summer coincide
with baseball season.
It's nearly impossible to fit more
than one quarter in per year for a pro
fessional baseball player even one
quarter may be difficult so cutting
down the number of quarters re
quired by one helps players earn
their degrees at least a year sooner.
"Having three quarters makes it
kind of a daunting task to come back,"
said Slater, who, as a top-100 prospect
according to ESPN, may choose to
leave after this season. "But having
only two, you could finish it in a fall
and a winter or split it up into two
falls."

"I've played with guys [in the
MLB] who had two years' worth of
classes roughly after they get drafted
and signed," said Houston Astros
catcher and Stanford alumnus Jason
Castro 'O9. "That makes it a little
more difficult and a little more daunt
ing to try and tackle in the middle of
an offseason. But when you're so
close and you only have to go back and
take a few classes to finish, it makes it
a little more manageable and not such
a large task to take on."
Although Castro left Stanford
after being drafted with the 10th
overall pick in the 2008 Draft by the
Astros, he never forgot about his
earning his degree. He was only 25
units away from completion, and de
spite successfully making it to the
major leagues, he came back twice to
complete a quarter in the fall, official
ly earning his degree in Sociology this
past December and entering the
ranks of the 4.3 percent of MLB play
ers with a college degree.
Similarly, former Stanford base
ball players Drew Storen and Austin
Wilson have been seen on campus re
cently as they returned to complete
their degrees. Former Cardinal play
ers that left school a year early for
baseball continue to flock back to
school to earn then* degrees, thanks
in large part to the fact that fall quar
ter generally aligns with the baseball
offseason.
Even for the juniors that choose to
stay for their senior year, it provides a
nice little bonus for senior year a
spring quarter full of baseball and
with no classes. Current seniors
Brant Whiting, A.J. Vanegas and
Brett Michael Doran graduated after
winter quarter and enjoyed the ideal
senior spring this quarter.
While other schools across the na
tion try to ease the academic loads
athletes face, Marquess instead
chooses to prioritize both academics
and athletics, refusing to compromise
the baseball players' futures for the
sake of baseball.
'As I tell the parents, I don't know
if they'll be a major league player for
15 years, but I do know they'll get
their Stanford degree," Marquess
said.

The process of spurring players
towards an early graduation begins
before they even step foot on campus.
"When you're getting recruited
here, [Marquess] makes it clear that
he expects all of us to be at least a
quarter ahead, some of us two quar
ters ahead," Slater said.
"To have people around you who
are trying to help guide you in the
right direction and making sure you
are doing the right things to be suc
cessful, that was a huge help right off
the bat," Castro added.
Unlike some programs that en
courage baseball players to take easi
er classes, Marquess doesn't restrict
the majors of his players, claiming
that the idea that a student-athlete
can't major in a specific area because
he plays baseball "is ridiculous." In
fact, many of his current players are
majoring in human biology or engi
neering. That includes senior Danny
Diekroeger and junior Luke Pappas,
who are both majoring in computer
science and boast a 3.8 GPA and a 4.0
GPA, respectively.
"Coach Marquess does a great job
of allowing us to pursue any major
that we want and scheduling practice
around our classes as opposed to us
doing the opposite and scheduling our
classes around practice," Slater said.
"He gives us a lot of freedom to pur
sue our academic interests and it pays
off, and we understand that and we
put in the work to make sure that we
are ahead and we are able to come
back and finish."
The extra classes come at a cost
not for the players, but for the coach
es. Marquess readily admits that it is
impossible to have players take so
many units and also get them all out
on the baseball field in the afternoon
at the same time. There is not a day
during the week in which every play
er can make a 2:30 or 3:30 afternoon
practice because of class.
Instead, the coaching staff works
individually with players on their own
schedule, sacrificing more of their
time so that the students can shape
their athletic commitments around
academics, and not the other way
around.
"I love when they were talking
about 8:30 classes and all the under
grads went fruitcake, saying 'are you
kidding me?' You know, it's hard when
you don't have 8 o'clock class to get it
in and to do the sport," said Marquess
about the inability to bring all the
players together at once.
Of course, a common worry sur
rounding the program is whether
the extra classes burden the players
too much and prevent them from
playing their best baseball during
their time at Stanford. Twenty-unit
quarters are no easy task, whether
the student is an athlete or not.
"Sometimes during the fall, fall
and winter, when we're amped up on
practice, it's tough when you're tak
ing 18 or 20 units," Slater said. "Be
tween four and five hour practices a
day and doing your work, it's tough
but it definitely pays off when you're
sitting at this point that I am right
now and you're looking at only two
quarters left next year."
To counter the added load, Mar
quess and the athletic advisors gen
erally recommend that baseball
players take an extra class that isn't
in their major and can be taken pass
fail. The multiple College World Se
ries appearances since the new aca
demic requirements were imple
mented prove that the academic load
doesn't stop student-athletes from
excelling on the baseball field as well.
♦ ♦♦
The academic support provided
by Marquess and the Stanford base
ball program doesn't end with the
additional requirements, either.
In the fall of 2013, former Stan
ford baseball pitcher Mark Ro
manczuk decided to start an alumni
mentorship program for the cur
rent student-athletes of Stanford
baseball that was readily approved
by Marquess. Romanczuk, who
ranks sixth all-time in Stanford his
tory with 28 career wins, had been a
beneficiary of Marquess' academic
approach as he returned to the
Farm in 2006 and graduated with a
degree in economics after leaving
Stanford to sign with the Arizona Di
amondbacks following his junior sea
son in 2005.

After playing four years of minor
league baseball, Romanczuk transi
tioned from professional baseball to
the world of finance in 2009 and faced
several challenges along the way.
Throughout the process, he noted
how beneficial it would have been to
have someone who had gone through
the same situations before to guide
him. His journey inspired him to help
current Cardinal baseball players
become prepared for the situations
they will face after Stanford.
"With so many talented Stanford
student-athletes who have excelled
in careers post-professional sports, I
recognized the value of creating a
platform to connect current Stan
ford baseball players with former
student-athletes in their targeted
post-athletics careers," Romanczuk
said.
What started from the experi
ences of one former player and cur
rent Goldman Sachs employee has
now developed into a program that
matches any interested Stanford
baseball player with a Stanford
baseball alumnus in the same aca
demic field. The alumnus can help
guide the player as he prepares for
both a potential baseball career and
a future career in the workforce by
providing academic advice, helping
find offseason internships and mold
ing a better resume.
"They have a very good perspec
tive on what you need to do to get to
where you want to be," Slater said of
the mentors. "Being an athlete,
sometimes you miss out on the in
ternships and some of the other
things you can do during the sum
mer because we're always playing
baseball. These guys have been
there and they know what it takes to
get where we want to be. It's great to
have that resource."
For professional baseball play
ers, staying connected and keeping a
resume up to date can mean the dif
ference between having a j ob in a few
years and being unemployed should
their baseball careers not pan out.
Romanczuk, the mentors and Mar
quess all hope that the program pro
vides connections and insight that
will keep players thinking about
their post-baseball lives during their
careers and land the players jobs
once their careers end.
"They're all focused on baseball,
but for a majority of them it's not
going to work out," Marquess said.
"If you're 28 years old and you

haven't even thought about it, you're
losing out. I use a story of guy who's
30 years old, a Stanford grad, he
goes in and has great academic cre
dentials and goes to an interview and
they say, 'you've been doing what for
the last eight years?' Doesn't make
any sense, they don't know about
baseball."

Marquess has coached the Cardi
nal to 14 College World Series ap
pearances, two national champi
onships and 1,525 wins in his 38
years at the helm of Stanford base
ball, while winning three NCAA
Coach of the Year awards, nine Pac
-10 Coach of the Year awards and
even a gold medal at the 1988
Olympics as head coach of the USA
Olympic baseball team.
Yet his legacy might be more de
fined by another stat: Of the 56 for
mer student-athletes he has coached
that have reached the MLB, 48 have
earned them college degrees. In a
world in which only 4.3 percent of
MLB players have college degrees,
86 percent of Marquess' former
players that reached the MLB have
their college degree.
"One of my proudest achieve
ments is being able to go back [to
Stanford] and finish," Castro said.
"Being so close once I did leave, I
never really thought of it as anything
other than when I had the time to go
back and do it. It was something that
I was always going to do."
It's extremely difficult to reach
the major leagues in baseball as a
career minor leaguer who never
reached the majors himself, Mar
quess knows that. With that in mind,
Marquess has created a powerhouse
program that not only succeeds on
the field each year, but prepares
players for any situation they might
face after their Stanford careers
on or off the baseball field.
Regardless of how their profes
sional careers turn out and when
they choose to leave Stanford, Car
dinal baseball players can look for
ward to a bright future thanks to
Marquess and the program he has
established.
"The good thing about the Stan
ford family is that everybody out
there wants to help," Marquess said.
There may be no one who wants
to help more than Marquess himself.

and winter, when we're amped up on
practice, it's tough when you're tak
ing 18 or 20 units," Slater said. "Be
tween four and five hour practices a
day and doing your work, it's tough
but it definitely pays off when you're
sitting at this point that I am right
now and you're looking at only two
quarters left next year."
To counter the added load, Mar
quess and the athletic advisors gen
erally recommend that baseball
players take an extra class that isn't
in their major and can be taken pass
fail. The multiple College World Se
ries appearances since the new aca
demic requirements were imple
mented prove that the academic load
doesn't stop student-athletes from
excelling on the baseball field as well.
♦ ♦♦
The academic support provided
by Marquess and the Stanford base
ball program doesn't end with the
additional requirements, either.
In the fall of 2013, former Stan
ford baseball pitcher Mark Ro
manczuk decided to start an alumni
mentorship program for the cur
rent student-athletes of Stanford
baseball that was readily approved
by Marquess. Romanczuk, who
ranks sixth all-time in Stanford his
tory with 28 career wins, had been a
beneficiary of Marquess' academic
approach as he returned to the
Farm in 2006 and graduated with a
degree in economics after leaving
Stanford to sign with the Arizona Di
amondbacks following his junior sea
son in 2005.

After playing four years of minor
league baseball, Romanczuk transi
tioned from professional baseball to
the world of finance in 2009 and faced
several challenges along the way.
Throughout the process, he noted
how beneficial it would have been to
have someone who had gone through
the same situations before to guide
him. His journey inspired him to help
current Cardinal baseball players
become prepared for the situations
they will face after Stanford.
"With so many talented Stanford
student-athletes who have excelled
in careers post-professional sports, I
recognized the value of creating a
platform to connect current Stan
ford baseball players with former
student-athletes in their targeted
post-athletics careers," Romanczuk
said.
What started from the experi
ences of one former player and cur
rent Goldman Sachs employee has
now developed into a program that
matches any interested Stanford
baseball player with a Stanford
baseball alumnus in the same aca
demic field. The alumnus can help
guide the player as he prepares for
both a potential baseball career and
a future career in the workforce by
providing academic advice, helping
find offseason internships and mold
ing a better resume.
"They have a very good perspec
tive on what you need to do to get to
where you want to be," Slater said of
the mentors. "Being an athlete,
sometimes you miss out on the in
ternships and some of the other
things you can do during the sum
mer because we're always playing
baseball. These guys have been
there and they know what it takes to
get where we want to be. It's great to
have that resource."
For professional baseball play
ers, staying connected and keeping a
resume up to date can mean the dif
ference between having a j ob in a few
years and being unemployed should
their baseball careers not pan out.
Romanczuk, the mentors and Mar
quess all hope that the program pro
vides connections and insight that
will keep players thinking about
their post-baseball lives during their
careers and land the players jobs
once their careers end.
"They're all focused on baseball,
but for a majority of them it's not
going to work out," Marquess said.
"If you're 28 years old and you

haven't even thought about it, you're
losing out. I use a story of guy who's
30 years old, a Stanford grad, he
goes in and has great academic cre
dentials and goes to an interview and
they say, 'you've been doing what for
the last eight years?' Doesn't make
any sense, they don't know about
baseball."

Marquess has coached the Cardi
nal to 14 College World Series ap
pearances, two national champi
onships and 1,525 wins in his 38
years at the helm of Stanford base
ball, while winning three NCAA
Coach of the Year awards, nine Pac
-10 Coach of the Year awards and
even a gold medal at the 1988
Olympics as head coach of the USA
Olympic baseball team.
Yet his legacy might be more de
fined by another stat: Of the 56 for
mer student-athletes he has coached
that have reached the MLB, 48 have
earned them college degrees. In a
world in which only 4.3 percent of
MLB players have college degrees,
86 percent of Marquess' former
players that reached the MLB have
their college degree.
"One of my proudest achieve
ments is being able to go back [to
Stanford] and finish," Castro said.
"Being so close once I did leave, I
never really thought of it as anything
other than when I had the time to go
back and do it. It was something that
I was always going to do."
It's extremely difficult to reach
the major leagues in baseball as a
career minor leaguer who never
reached the majors himself, Mar
quess knows that. With that in mind,
Marquess has created a powerhouse
program that not only succeeds on
the field each year, but prepares
players for any situation they might
face after their Stanford careers
on or off the baseball field.
Regardless of how their profes
sional careers turn out and when
they choose to leave Stanford, Car
dinal baseball players can look for
ward to a bright future thanks to
Marquess and the program he has
established.
"The good thing about the Stan
ford family is that everybody out
there wants to help," Marquess said.
There may be no one who wants
to help more than Marquess himself.

Every baseball player dreams of
reaching the major leagues. From
little league to high school to college,
the ultimate goal remains the same:
to hear your name called in the
MLB draft and ascend to the major
league level.
However, unlike most American
sports leagues, the MLB dream is
not completed on the day of the
draft. Those who are drafted in the
first round of the NBA and NFL
drafts are virtually guaranteed at
least a year or two with their respec
tive teams and play at the highest
level in their first year. It's unheard
of for a first-round pick in the NBA
and NFL to never don the team's
uniform for at least a single game.
In baseball, though, the reality is
much different. Only 73 percent of
first-round picks in the MLB draft
ever play a day in the major leagues,
with the other 27 percent becoming
career minor league players. Con
sidering all rounds, only one in six
players selected in the MLB draft
will ever make it to the maj or league
level, and one in 20 draftees will be
come "regulars," or someone who
plays for three years or more.
Adding to the difficulty, once a
baseball player reaches the big
leagues, he cannot become a free
agent and competitively negotiate a
contract until six years have passed,
potentially after the prime of his ca
reer. As such, although the MLB
has become known for the mega
contracts of Alex Rodriguez, Albert
Pujols and others, only about half
(378 of 750 players) of the players
make $2 million or more per season.
The odds of becoming an estab
lished major leaguer are slim at
best, even if a player is drafted. Yet
despite the likely need for a career
change, college degrees are rare
finds among professional baseball
players. According to the College
Sport Research Institute, college
baseball players graduate at rates
31.29 percent lower than the aver
age male graduation rate. Pac-12
players, meanwhile, graduate at

rates 44.3 percent lower than the
Pac-12's average male graduation
rate. Additionally, only 4.3 percent
of MLB players have a college de
gree.
Despite the success of NCAA
student-athletes graduating as a
whole, college baseball remains
troubled with graduation issues due
to the fact that college baseball play
ers can be drafted and leave after
their junior years, similarly to in col
lege football. Yet unlike football
players, the baseball players that
leave early after being drafted may
never play a day in the big leagues.

Over 20 years ago, Stanford
baseball head coach Mark Marquess
recognized that something needed

to change.
"The two guys where I really
changed my theory were Jeffrey
Hammonds and Ed Sprague," Mar
quess shared. "Both were first
round picks and both were in the big
leagues within a year and a half and
both played for years in the big
leagues, but both didn't get their
Stanford degrees because when
you're a position player and you go
out and play in the summer, they
want you to go to winter league or
they want you to go to instructional
ball and they pay you a million dol
lars so you can't say no.
"All of a sudden you never get a
chance to go back to school and

Junior Austin Slater (above) could be a potential early-round MLB draft pick this week. Slater was drafted
out of high school to the LA Dodgers but turned down the offer in order to play for the Stanford Cardinal.
you're in the big leagues, you've made
a lot of money, so you don't really need
[the degree], but I said, 'what a sin
that you go there for three years and
you don't get your Stanford degree,"'
he added.
Hammonds, the fourth overall
pick in the 1992 Draft by the Balti
more Orioles and recent Stanford
Hall of Fame inductee, and Sprague,
the 25th overall pick in the 1988 Draft
by the Toronto Blue Jays, both defied
the odds and lasted past their first six
years in the major leagues and were
able to negotiate free-agent con
tracts. A .272 lifetime hitter with 110
home runs over his 13-year career,
Hammonds made more than enough
money to provide for himself and his
family. Similarly, Sprague's 11-year
career saw him hit 152 home runs.
But when then careers ended in then
mid-to-late 30s, what came next?
"When [Hammonds] was with the
Giants towards the end of his career,
he came over and met with his advisor
or somebody in his department and
figured out what he needed to gradu
ate," Marquess said. "He got out of
baseball and lived in Florida with his
wife and a couple young kids. He
would fly out here Sunday night, rent
ed a townhouse in Palo Alto and flew
home on Thursday to come back and
get his degree."
Indeed, Hammonds returned to
Stanford and earned his degree over
a decade after he originally attended
the university but not without obsta
cles. Not only was he years removed
from taking classes, but he had a fam
ily to care for.
"He's the guy that I changed [the
program for] because it was unfair,"
Marquess said. "He was on time [to
graduate] but he had to come back
and get his degree. I'm really proud of
him."
In the 19905, Marquess began
talks with Stanford's athletic advisors
to determine what could be done to
prevent Hammonds' situation from

reoccurring and to help players get
their college degrees even if they
chose to leave after then* junior sea
sons. A plan was quickly struck that
consisted of Stanford baseball play
ers taking an extra class during their
fall or winter quarters, or both, to get
ahead. That way, by the time then
junior year ended, baseball players
would be at least a quarter ahead and
would only need two more quarters,
at most, to complete then* degrees.
This plan has been in action ever
since.
'A typical fall is somewhere be
tween 18 and 20 units, winter is some
where between 16 and 20 units, de
pending on what year you are, and
usually freshman try to take closer to
20," said junior outfielder Austin
Slater. "Then during spring usually
it's 12 to 15 units, somewhere in
there."
Marquess' academic strategy has
been wildly successful since it was ini
tially instituted. Every Stanford
baseball player is required to be at
least a quarter ahead by the end of his
junior year, leaving only two quarters
left to complete his degree.
If a player then leaves after his
junior year for the MLB draft, which
has become a common trend through
out college baseball, the amount of
classes left to earn his degree would
be cut down by at least an entire quar
ter. This is a significant amount to a
professional baseball player when the
fall and winter are so valuable for in
structional offseason baseball that
might be required for minor leaguers
and the spring and summer coincide
with baseball season.
It's nearly impossible to fit more
than one quarter in per year for a pro
fessional baseball player even one
quarter may be difficult so cutting
down the number of quarters re
quired by one helps players earn
their degrees at least a year sooner.
"Having three quarters makes it
kind of a daunting task to come back,"
said Slater, who, as a top-100 prospect
according to ESPN, may choose to
leave after this season. "But having
only two, you could finish it in a fall
and a winter or split it up into two
falls."

"I've played with guys [in the
MLB] who had two years' worth of
classes roughly after they get drafted
and signed," said Houston Astros
catcher and Stanford alumnus Jason
Castro 'O9. "That makes it a little
more difficult and a little more daunt
ing to try and tackle in the middle of
an offseason. But when you're so
close and you only have to go back and
take a few classes to finish, it makes it
a little more manageable and not such
a large task to take on."
Although Castro left Stanford
after being drafted with the 10th
overall pick in the 2008 Draft by the
Astros, he never forgot about his
earning his degree. He was only 25
units away from completion, and de
spite successfully making it to the
major leagues, he came back twice to
complete a quarter in the fall, official
ly earning his degree in Sociology this
past December and entering the
ranks of the 4.3 percent of MLB play
ers with a college degree.
Similarly, former Stanford base
ball players Drew Storen and Austin
Wilson have been seen on campus re
cently as they returned to complete
their degrees. Former Cardinal play
ers that left school a year early for
baseball continue to flock back to
school to earn then* degrees, thanks
in large part to the fact that fall quar
ter generally aligns with the baseball
offseason.
Even for the juniors that choose to
stay for their senior year, it provides a
nice little bonus for senior year a
spring quarter full of baseball and
with no classes. Current seniors
Brant Whiting, A.J. Vanegas and
Brett Michael Doran graduated after
winter quarter and enjoyed the ideal
senior spring this quarter.
While other schools across the na
tion try to ease the academic loads
athletes face, Marquess instead
chooses to prioritize both academics
and athletics, refusing to compromise
the baseball players' futures for the
sake of baseball.
'As I tell the parents, I don't know
if they'll be a major league player for
15 years, but I do know they'll get
their Stanford degree," Marquess
said.

The process of spurring players
towards an early graduation begins
before they even step foot on campus.
"When you're getting recruited
here, [Marquess] makes it clear that
he expects all of us to be at least a
quarter ahead, some of us two quar
ters ahead," Slater said.
"To have people around you who
are trying to help guide you in the
right direction and making sure you
are doing the right things to be suc
cessful, that was a huge help right off
the bat," Castro added.
Unlike some programs that en
courage baseball players to take easi
er classes, Marquess doesn't restrict
the majors of his players, claiming
that the idea that a student-athlete
can't major in a specific area because
he plays baseball "is ridiculous." In
fact, many of his current players are
majoring in human biology or engi
neering. That includes senior Danny
Diekroeger and junior Luke Pappas,
who are both majoring in computer
science and boast a 3.8 GPA and a 4.0
GPA, respectively.
"Coach Marquess does a great job
of allowing us to pursue any major
that we want and scheduling practice
around our classes as opposed to us
doing the opposite and scheduling our
classes around practice," Slater said.
"He gives us a lot of freedom to pur
sue our academic interests and it pays
off, and we understand that and we
put in the work to make sure that we
are ahead and we are able to come
back and finish."
The extra classes come at a cost
not for the players, but for the coach
es. Marquess readily admits that it is
impossible to have players take so
many units and also get them all out
on the baseball field in the afternoon
at the same time. There is not a day
during the week in which every play
er can make a 2:30 or 3:30 afternoon
practice because of class.
Instead, the coaching staff works
individually with players on their own
schedule, sacrificing more of their
time so that the students can shape
their athletic commitments around
academics, and not the other way
around.
"I love when they were talking
about 8:30 classes and all the under
grads went fruitcake, saying 'are you
kidding me?' You know, it's hard when
you don't have 8 o'clock class to get it
in and to do the sport," said Marquess
about the inability to bring all the
players together at once.
Of course, a common worry sur
rounding the program is whether
the extra classes burden the players
too much and prevent them from
playing their best baseball during
their time at Stanford. Twenty-unit
quarters are no easy task, whether
the student is an athlete or not.
"Sometimes during the fall, fall
and winter, when we're amped up on
practice, it's tough when you're tak
ing 18 or 20 units," Slater said. "Be
tween four and five hour practices a
day and doing your work, it's tough
but it definitely pays off when you're
sitting at this point that I am right
now and you're looking at only two
quarters left next year."
To counter the added load, Mar
quess and the athletic advisors gen
erally recommend that baseball
players take an extra class that isn't
in their major and can be taken pass
fail. The multiple College World Se

demic requirements were imple

tially instituted. Every Stanford
baseball player is required to be at
least a quarter ahead by the end of his
junior year, leaving only two quarters
left to complete his degree.
If a player then leaves after his
junior year for the MLB draft, which
has become a common trend through
out college baseball, the amount of
classes left to earn his degree would
be cut down by at least an entire quar
ter. This is a significant amount to a
professional baseball player when the
fall and winter are so valuable for in
structional offseason baseball that
might be required for minor leaguers
and the spring and summer coincide
with baseball season.
It's nearly impossible to fit more
than one quarter in per year for a pro
fessional baseball player even one
quarter may be difficult so cutting
down the number of quarters re
quired by one helps players earn
their degrees at least a year sooner.
"Having three quarters makes it
kind of a daunting task to come back,"
said Slater, who, as a top-100 prospect
according to ESPN, may choose to
leave after this season. "But having
only two, you could finish it in a fall
and a winter or split it up into two
falls."

"I've played with guys [in the
MLB] who had two years' worth of
classes roughly after they get drafted
and signed," said Houston Astros
catcher and Stanford alumnus Jason
Castro 'O9. "That makes it a little
more difficult and a little more daunt
ing to try and tackle in the middle of
an offseason. But when you're so
close and you only have to go back and
take a few classes to finish, it makes it
a little more manageable and not such
a large task to take on."
Although Castro left Stanford
after being drafted with the 10th
overall pick in the 2008 Draft by the
Astros, he never forgot about his
earning his degree. He was only 25
units away from completion, and de
spite successfully making it to the
major leagues, he came back twice to
complete a quarter in the fall, official
ly earning his degree in Sociology this
past December and entering the
ranks of the 4.3 percent of MLB play
ers with a college degree.
Similarly, former Stanford base
ball players Drew Storen and Austin
Wilson have been seen on campus re
cently as they returned to complete
their degrees. Former Cardinal play
ers that left school a year early for
baseball continue to flock back to
school to earn then* degrees, thanks
in large part to the fact that fall quar
ter generally aligns with the baseball
offseason.
Even for the juniors that choose to
stay for their senior year, it provides a
nice little bonus for senior year a
spring quarter full of baseball and
with no classes. Current seniors
Brant Whiting, A.J. Vanegas and
Brett Michael Doran graduated after
winter quarter and enjoyed the ideal
senior spring this quarter.
While other schools across the na
tion try to ease the academic loads
athletes face, Marquess instead
chooses to prioritize both academics
and athletics, refusing to compromise
the baseball players' futures for the
sake of baseball.
'As I tell the parents, I don't know
if they'll be a major league player for
15 years, but I do know they'll get
their Stanford degree," Marquess
said.

The process of spurring players
towards an early graduation begins
before they even step foot on campus.
"When you're getting recruited
here, [Marquess] makes it clear that
he expects all of us to be at least a
quarter ahead, some of us two quar
ters ahead," Slater said.
"To have people around you who
are trying to help guide you in the
right direction and making sure you
are doing the right things to be suc
cessful, that was a huge help right off
the bat," Castro added.
Unlike some programs that en
courage baseball players to take easi
er classes, Marquess doesn't restrict
the majors of his players, claiming
that the idea that a student-athlete
can't major in a specific area because
he plays baseball "is ridiculous." In
fact, many of his current players are
majoring in human biology or engi
neering. That includes senior Danny
Diekroeger and junior Luke Pappas,
who are both majoring in computer
science and boast a 3.8 GPA and a 4.0
GPA, respectively.
"Coach Marquess does a great job
of allowing us to pursue any major
that we want and scheduling practice
around our classes as opposed to us
doing the opposite and scheduling our
classes around practice," Slater said.
"He gives us a lot of freedom to pur
sue our academic interests and it pays
off, and we understand that and we
put in the work to make sure that we
are ahead and we are able to come
back and finish."
The extra classes come at a cost
not for the players, but for the coach
es. Marquess readily admits that it is
impossible to have players take so
many units and also get them all out
on the baseball field in the afternoon
at the same time. There is not a day
during the week in which every play
er can make a 2:30 or 3:30 afternoon
practice because of class.
Instead, the coaching staff works
individually with players on their own
schedule, sacrificing more of their
time so that the students can shape
their athletic commitments around
academics, and not the other way
around.
"I love when they were talking
about 8:30 classes and all the under
grads went fruitcake, saying 'are you
kidding me?' You know, it's hard when
you don't have 8 o'clock class to get it
in and to do the sport," said Marquess
about the inability to bring all the
players together at once.
Of course, a common worry sur
rounding the program is whether
the extra classes burden the players
too much and prevent them from
playing their best baseball during
their time at Stanford. Twenty-unit
quarters are no easy task, whether
the student is an athlete or not.
"Sometimes during the fall, fall
and winter, when we're amped up on
practice, it's tough when you're tak
ing 18 or 20 units," Slater said. "Be
tween four and five hour practices a
day and doing your work, it's tough
but it definitely pays off when you're
sitting at this point that I am right
now and you're looking at only two
quarters left next year."
To counter the added load, Mar
quess and the athletic advisors gen
erally recommend that baseball
players take an extra class that isn't
in their major and can be taken pass
fail. The multiple College World Se
ries appearances since the new aca
demic requirements were imple
mented prove that the academic load
doesn't stop student-athletes from
excelling on the baseball field as well.
♦ ♦♦
The academic support provided
by Marquess and the Stanford base
ball program doesn't end with the
additional requirements, either.
In the fall of 2013, former Stan
ford baseball pitcher Mark Ro
manczuk decided to start an alumni
mentorship program for the cur
rent student-athletes of Stanford
baseball that was readily approved
by Marquess. Romanczuk, who
ranks sixth all-time in Stanford his
tory with 28 career wins, had been a
beneficiary of Marquess' academic
approach as he returned to the
Farm in 2006 and graduated with a
degree in economics after leaving
Stanford to sign with the Arizona Di
amondbacks following his junior sea
son in 2005.

After playing four years of minor
league baseball, Romanczuk transi
tioned from professional baseball to
the world of finance in 2009 and faced
several challenges along the way.
Throughout the process, he noted
how beneficial it would have been to
have someone who had gone through
the same situations before to guide
him. His journey inspired him to help
current Cardinal baseball players
become prepared for the situations
they will face after Stanford.
"With so many talented Stanford
student-athletes who have excelled
in careers post-professional sports, I
recognized the value of creating a
platform to connect current Stan
ford baseball players with former
student-athletes in their targeted
post-athletics careers," Romanczuk
said.
What started from the experi
ences of one former player and cur
rent Goldman Sachs employee has
now developed into a program that
matches any interested Stanford
baseball player with a Stanford
baseball alumnus in the same aca
demic field. The alumnus can help
guide the player as he prepares for
both a potential baseball career and
a future career in the workforce by
providing academic advice, helping
find offseason internships and mold
ing a better resume.
"They have a very good perspec
tive on what you need to do to get to
where you want to be," Slater said of
the mentors. "Being an athlete,
sometimes you miss out on the in
ternships and some of the other
things you can do during the sum
mer because we're always playing
baseball. These guys have been
there and they know what it takes to
get where we want to be. It's great to
have that resource."
For professional baseball play
ers, staying connected and keeping a
resume up to date can mean the dif
ference between having a j ob in a few
years and being unemployed should
their baseball careers not pan out.
Romanczuk, the mentors and Mar
quess all hope that the program pro
vides connections and insight that
will keep players thinking about
their post-baseball lives during their
careers and land the players jobs
once their careers end.
"They're all focused on baseball,
but for a majority of them it's not
going to work out," Marquess said.
"If you're 28 years old and you

haven't even thought about it, you're
losing out. I use a story of guy who's
30 years old, a Stanford grad, he
goes in and has great academic cre
dentials and goes to an interview and
they say, 'you've been doing what for
the last eight years?' Doesn't make
any sense, they don't know about
baseball."
♦ ♦♦
Marquess has coached the Cardi
nal to 14 College World Series ap
pearances, two national champi
onships and 1,525 wins in his 38
years at the helm of Stanford base
ball, while winning three NCAA
Coach of the Year awards, nine Pac
-10 Coach of the Year awards and
even a gold medal at the 1988
Olympics as head coach of the USA
Olympic baseball team.
Yet his legacy might be more de
fined by another stat: Of the 56 for
mer student-athletes he has coached
that have reached the MLB, 48 have
earned them college degrees. In a
world in which only 4.3 percent of
MLB players have college degrees,
86 percent of Marquess' former
players that reached the MLB have
their college degree.
"One of my proudest achieve
ments is being able to go back [to
Stanford] and finish," Castro said.
"Being so close once I did leave, I
never really thought of it as anything
other than when I had the time to go
back and do it. It was something that
I was always going to do."
It's extremely difficult to reach
the major leagues in baseball as a
career minor leaguer who never
reached the majors himself, Mar
quess knows that. With that in mind,
Marquess has created a powerhouse
program that not only succeeds on
the field each year, but prepares
players for any situation they might
face after their Stanford careers
on or off the baseball field.
Regardless of how their profes
sional careers turn out and when
they choose to leave Stanford, Car
dinal baseball players can look for
ward to a bright future thanks to
Marquess and the program he has
established.
"The good thing about the Stan
ford family is that everybody out
there wants to help," Marquess said.
There may be no one who wants
to help more than Marquess himself.

Every baseball player dreams of
reaching the major leagues. From
little league to high school to college,
the ultimate goal remains the same:
to hear your name called in the
MLB draft and ascend to the major
league level.
However, unlike most American
sports leagues, the MLB dream is
not completed on the day of the
draft. Those who are drafted in the
first round of the NBA and NFL
drafts are virtually guaranteed at
least a year or two with their respec
tive teams and play at the highest
level in their first year. It's unheard
of for a first-round pick in the NBA
and NFL to never don the team's
uniform for at least a single game.
In baseball, though, the reality is
much different. Only 73 percent of
first-round picks in the MLB draft
ever play a day in the major leagues,
with the other 27 percent becoming
career minor league players. Con
sidering all rounds, only one in six
players selected in the MLB draft
will ever make it to the maj or league
level, and one in 20 draftees will be
come "regulars," or someone who
plays for three years or more.
Adding to the difficulty, once a
baseball player reaches the big
leagues, he cannot become a free
agent and competitively negotiate a
contract until six years have passed,
potentially after the prime of his ca
reer. As such, although the MLB
has become known for the mega
contracts of Alex Rodriguez, Albert
Pujols and others, only about half
(378 of 750 players) of the players
make $2 million or more per season.
The odds of becoming an estab
lished major leaguer are slim at
best, even if a player is drafted. Yet
despite the likely need for a career
change, college degrees are rare
finds among professional baseball
players. According to the College
Sport Research Institute, college
baseball players graduate at rates
31.29 percent lower than the aver
age male graduation rate. Pac-12
players, meanwhile, graduate at

rates 44.3 percent lower than the
Pac-12's average male graduation
rate. Additionally, only 4.3 percent
of MLB players have a college de
gree.
Despite the success of NCAA
student-athletes graduating as a
whole, college baseball remains
troubled with graduation issues due
to the fact that college baseball play
ers can be drafted and leave after
their junior years, similarly to in col
lege football. Yet unlike football
players, the baseball players that
leave early after being drafted may
never play a day in the big leagues.

Over 20 years ago, Stanford
baseball head coach Mark Marquess
recognized that something needed

to change.
"The two guys where I really
changed my theory were Jeffrey
Hammonds and Ed Sprague," Mar
quess shared. "Both were first
round picks and both were in the big
leagues within a year and a half and
both played for years in the big
leagues, but both didn't get their
Stanford degrees because when
you're a position player and you go
out and play in the summer, they
want you to go to winter league or
they want you to go to instructional
ball and they pay you a million dol
lars so you can't say no.
"All of a sudden you never get a
chance to go back to school and

In the 1990s, head coach Mark Marquess (above) began the
conversation with Stanford's athletic directors on how to get players
their degrees efficiently despite leaving their junior year for the pros.

Junior Austin Slater (above) could be a potential early-round MLB draft pick this week. Slater was drafted
out of high school to the LA Dodgers but turned down the offer in order to play for the Stanford Cardinal.
you're in the big leagues, you've made
a lot of money, so you don't really need
[the degree], but I said, 'what a sin
that you go there for three years and
you don't get your Stanford degree,"'
he added.
Hammonds, the fourth overall
pick in the 1992 Draft by the Balti
more Orioles and recent Stanford
Hall of Fame inductee, and Sprague,
the 25th overall pick in the 1988 Draft
by the Toronto Blue Jays, both defied
the odds and lasted past their first six
years in the major leagues and were
able to negotiate free-agent con
tracts. A .272 lifetime hitter with 110
home runs over his 13-year career,
Hammonds made more than enough
money to provide for himself and his
family. Similarly, Sprague's 11-year
career saw him hit 152 home runs.
But when then careers ended in then
mid-to-late 30s, what came next?
"When [Hammonds] was with the
Giants towards the end of his career,
he came over and met with his advisor
or somebody in his department and
figured out what he needed to gradu
ate," Marquess said. "He got out of
baseball and lived in Florida with his
wife and a couple young kids. He
would fly out here Sunday night, rent
ed a townhouse in Palo Alto and flew
home on Thursday to come back and
get his degree."
Indeed, Hammonds returned to
Stanford and earned his degree over
a decade after he originally attended
the university but not without obsta
cles. Not only was he years removed
from taking classes, but he had a fam
ily to care for.
"He's the guy that I changed [the
program for] because it was unfair,"
Marquess said. "He was on time [to
graduate] but he had to come back
and get his degree. I'm really proud of
him."
In the 19905, Marquess began
talks with Stanford's athletic advisors
to determine what could be done to
prevent Hammonds' situation from

reoccurring and to help players get
their college degrees even if they
chose to leave after then* junior sea
sons. A plan was quickly struck that
consisted of Stanford baseball play
ers taking an extra class during their
fall or winter quarters, or both, to get
ahead. That way, by the time then
junior year ended, baseball players
would be at least a quarter ahead and
would only need two more quarters,
at most, to complete then* degrees.
This plan has been in action ever
since.
'A typical fall is somewhere be
tween 18 and 20 units, winter is some
where between 16 and 20 units, de
pending on what year you are, and
usually freshman try to take closer to
20," said junior outfielder Austin
Slater. "Then during spring usually
it's 12 to 15 units, somewhere in
there."
Marquess' academic strategy has
been wildly successful since it was ini
tially instituted. Every Stanford
baseball player is required to be at
least a quarter ahead by the end of his
junior year, leaving only two quarters
left to complete his degree.
If a player then leaves after his
junior year for the MLB draft, which
has become a common trend through
out college baseball, the amount of
classes left to earn his degree would
be cut down by at least an entire quar
ter. This is a significant amount to a

structional offseason baseball that

said Slater, who, as a top-100 prospect

only two, you could finish it in a fall
and a winter or split it up into two
falls."

"I've played with guys [in the

close and you only have to go back and
take a few classes to finish, it makes it
a little more manageable and not such

Although Castro left Stanford
after being drafted with the 10th
overall pick in the 2008 Draft by the
Astros, he never forgot about his
earning his degree. He was only 25

ever play a day in the major leagues,
with the other 27 percent becoming
career minor league players. Con
sidering all rounds, only one in six
players selected in the MLB draft
will ever make it to the maj or league
level, and one in 20 draftees will be
come "regulars," or someone who
plays for three years or more.
Adding to the difficulty, once a
baseball player reaches the big
leagues, he cannot become a free
agent and competitively negotiate a
contract until six years have passed,
potentially after the prime of his ca
reer. As such, although the MLB
has become known for the mega
contracts of Alex Rodriguez, Albert
Pujols and others, only about half
(378 of 750 players) of the players
make $2 million or more per season.
The odds of becoming an estab
lished major leaguer are slim at
best, even if a player is drafted. Yet
despite the likely need for a career
change, college degrees are rare
finds among professional baseball
players. According to the College
Sport Research Institute, college
baseball players graduate at rates
31.29 percent lower than the aver
age male graduation rate. Pac-12
players, meanwhile, graduate at

rates 44.3 percent lower than the
Pac-12's average male graduation
rate. Additionally, only 4.3 percent
of MLB players have a college de
gree.
Despite the success of NCAA
student-athletes graduating as a
whole, college baseball remains
troubled with graduation issues due
to the fact that college baseball play
ers can be drafted and leave after
their junior years, similarly to in col
lege football. Yet unlike football
players, the baseball players that
leave early after being drafted may
never play a day in the big leagues.

Over 20 years ago, Stanford
baseball head coach Mark Marquess
recognized that something needed

to change.
"The two guys where I really
changed my theory were Jeffrey
Hammonds and Ed Sprague," Mar
quess shared. "Both were first
round picks and both were in the big
leagues within a year and a half and
both played for years in the big
leagues, but both didn't get their
Stanford degrees because when
you're a position player and you go
out and play in the summer, they
want you to go to winter league or
they want you to go to instructional
ball and they pay you a million dol
lars so you can't say no.
"All of a sudden you never get a
chance to go back to school and

Junior Austin Slater (above) could be a potential early-round MLB draft pick this week. Slater was drafted
out of high school to the LA Dodgers but turned down the offer in order to play for the Stanford Cardinal.
you're in the big leagues, you've made
a lot of money, so you don't really need
[the degree], but I said, 'what a sin
that you go there for three years and
you don't get your Stanford degree,"'
he added.
Hammonds, the fourth overall
pick in the 1992 Draft by the Balti
more Orioles and recent Stanford
Hall of Fame inductee, and Sprague,
the 25th overall pick in the 1988 Draft
by the Toronto Blue Jays, both defied
the odds and lasted past their first six
years in the major leagues and were
able to negotiate free-agent con
tracts. A .272 lifetime hitter with 110
home runs over his 13-year career,
Hammonds made more than enough
money to provide for himself and his
family. Similarly, Sprague's 11-year
career saw him hit 152 home runs.
But when then careers ended in then
mid-to-late 30s, what came next?
"When [Hammonds] was with the
Giants towards the end of his career,
he came over and met with his advisor
or somebody in his department and
figured out what he needed to gradu
ate," Marquess said. "He got out of
baseball and lived in Florida with his
wife and a couple young kids. He
would fly out here Sunday night, rent
ed a townhouse in Palo Alto and flew
home on Thursday to come back and
get his degree."
Indeed, Hammonds returned to
Stanford and earned his degree over
a decade after he originally attended
the university but not without obsta
cles. Not only was he years removed
from taking classes, but he had a fam
ily to care for.
"He's the guy that I changed [the
program for] because it was unfair,"
Marquess said. "He was on time [to
graduate] but he had to come back
and get his degree. I'm really proud of
him."
In the 19905, Marquess began
talks with Stanford's athletic advisors
to determine what could be done to
prevent Hammonds' situation from

reoccurring and to help players get
their college degrees even if they
chose to leave after then* junior sea
sons. A plan was quickly struck that
consisted of Stanford baseball play
ers taking an extra class during their
fall or winter quarters, or both, to get
ahead. That way, by the time then
junior year ended, baseball players
would be at least a quarter ahead and
would only need two more quarters,
at most, to complete then* degrees.
This plan has been in action ever
since.
'A typical fall is somewhere be
tween 18 and 20 units, winter is some
where between 16 and 20 units, de
pending on what year you are, and
usually freshman try to take closer to
20," said junior outfielder Austin
Slater. "Then during spring usually
it's 12 to 15 units, somewhere in
there."
Marquess' academic strategy has
been wildly successful since it was ini
tially instituted. Every Stanford
baseball player is required to be at
least a quarter ahead by the end of his
junior year, leaving only two quarters
left to complete his degree.
If a player then leaves after his
junior year for the MLB draft, which
has become a common trend through
out college baseball, the amount of
classes left to earn his degree would
be cut down by at least an entire quar
ter. This is a significant amount to a
professional baseball player when the
fall and winter are so valuable for in
structional offseason baseball that
might be required for minor leaguers
and the spring and summer coincide
with baseball season.
It's nearly impossible to fit more
than one quarter in per year for a pro
fessional baseball player even one
quarter may be difficult so cutting
down the number of quarters re
quired by one helps players earn
their degrees at least a year sooner.
"Having three quarters makes it
kind of a daunting task to come back,"
said Slater, who, as a top-100 prospect
according to ESPN, may choose to
leave after this season. "But having
only two, you could finish it in a fall
and a winter or split it up into two
falls."

"I've played with guys [in the
MLB] who had two years' worth of
classes roughly after they get drafted
and signed," said Houston Astros
catcher and Stanford alumnus Jason
Castro 'O9. "That makes it a little
more difficult and a little more daunt
ing to try and tackle in the middle of
an offseason. But when you're so
close and you only have to go back and
take a few classes to finish, it makes it
a little more manageable and not such
a large task to take on."
Although Castro left Stanford
after being drafted with the 10th
overall pick in the 2008 Draft by the
Astros, he never forgot about his
earning his degree. He was only 25
units away from completion, and de
spite successfully making it to the
major leagues, he came back twice to
complete a quarter in the fall, official
ly earning his degree in Sociology this
past December and entering the
ranks of the 4.3 percent of MLB play
ers with a college degree.
Similarly, former Stanford base
ball players Drew Storen and Austin
Wilson have been seen on campus re
cently as they returned to complete
their degrees. Former Cardinal play
ers that left school a year early for
baseball continue to flock back to
school to earn then* degrees, thanks
in large part to the fact that fall quar
ter generally aligns with the baseball
offseason.
Even for the juniors that choose to
stay for their senior year, it provides a
nice little bonus for senior year a
spring quarter full of baseball and
with no classes. Current seniors
Brant Whiting, A.J. Vanegas and
Brett Michael Doran graduated after
winter quarter and enjoyed the ideal
senior spring this quarter.
While other schools across the na
tion try to ease the academic loads
athletes face, Marquess instead
chooses to prioritize both academics
and athletics, refusing to compromise
the baseball players' futures for the
sake of baseball.
'As I tell the parents, I don't know
if they'll be a major league player for
15 years, but I do know they'll get
their Stanford degree," Marquess
said.

The process of spurring players
towards an early graduation begins
before they even step foot on campus.
"When you're getting recruited
here, [Marquess] makes it clear that
he expects all of us to be at least a
quarter ahead, some of us two quar
ters ahead," Slater said.
"To have people around you who
are trying to help guide you in the
right direction and making sure you
are doing the right things to be suc
cessful, that was a huge help right off
the bat," Castro added.
Unlike some programs that en
courage baseball players to take easi
er classes, Marquess doesn't restrict
the majors of his players, claiming
that the idea that a student-athlete
can't major in a specific area because
he plays baseball "is ridiculous." In
fact, many of his current players are
majoring in human biology or engi
neering. That includes senior Danny
Diekroeger and junior Luke Pappas,
who are both majoring in computer
science and boast a 3.8 GPA and a 4.0
GPA, respectively.
"Coach Marquess does a great job
of allowing us to pursue any major
that we want and scheduling practice
around our classes as opposed to us
doing the opposite and scheduling our
classes around practice," Slater said.
"He gives us a lot of freedom to pur
sue our academic interests and it pays
off, and we understand that and we
put in the work to make sure that we
are ahead and we are able to come
back and finish."
The extra classes come at a cost
not for the players, but for the coach
es. Marquess readily admits that it is
impossible to have players take so
many units and also get them all out
on the baseball field in the afternoon
at the same time. There is not a day
during the week in which every play
er can make a 2:30 or 3:30 afternoon
practice because of class.
Instead, the coaching staff works
individually with players on their own
schedule, sacrificing more of their
time so that the students can shape
their athletic commitments around
academics, and not the other way
around.
"I love when they were talking
about 8:30 classes and all the under
grads went fruitcake, saying 'are you
kidding me?' You know, it's hard when
you don't have 8 o'clock class to get it
in and to do the sport," said Marquess
about the inability to bring all the
players together at once.
Of course, a common worry sur
rounding the program is whether
the extra classes burden the players
too much and prevent them from
playing their best baseball during
their time at Stanford. Twenty-unit
quarters are no easy task, whether
the student is an athlete or not.
"Sometimes during the fall, fall
and winter, when we're amped up on
practice, it's tough when you're tak
ing 18 or 20 units," Slater said. "Be
tween four and five hour practices a
day and doing your work, it's tough
but it definitely pays off when you're
sitting at this point that I am right
now and you're looking at only two
quarters left next year."
To counter the added load, Mar
quess and the athletic advisors gen
erally recommend that baseball
players take an extra class that isn't
in their major and can be taken pass
fail. The multiple College World Se
ries appearances since the new aca
demic requirements were imple
mented prove that the academic load
doesn't stop student-athletes from
excelling on the baseball field as well.
♦ ♦♦
The academic support provided
by Marquess and the Stanford base
ball program doesn't end with the
additional requirements, either.
In the fall of 2013, former Stan
ford baseball pitcher Mark Ro
manczuk decided to start an alumni
mentorship program for the cur
rent student-athletes of Stanford
baseball that was readily approved
by Marquess. Romanczuk, who
ranks sixth all-time in Stanford his
tory with 28 career wins, had been a
beneficiary of Marquess' academic
approach as he returned to the
Farm in 2006 and graduated with a
degree in economics after leaving
Stanford to sign with the Arizona Di
amondbacks following his junior sea
son in 2005.

After playing four years of minor
league baseball, Romanczuk transi
tioned from professional baseball to
the world of finance in 2009 and faced
several challenges along the way.
Throughout the process, he noted
how beneficial it would have been to
have someone who had gone through
the same situations before to guide
him. His journey inspired him to help
current Cardinal baseball players
become prepared for the situations
they will face after Stanford.
"With so many talented Stanford
student-athletes who have excelled
in careers post-professional sports, I
recognized the value of creating a
platform to connect current Stan
ford baseball players with former
student-athletes in their targeted
post-athletics careers," Romanczuk
said.
What started from the experi
ences of one former player and cur
rent Goldman Sachs employee has
now developed into a program that
matches any interested Stanford
baseball player with a Stanford
baseball alumnus in the same aca
demic field. The alumnus can help
guide the player as he prepares for
both a potential baseball career and
a future career in the workforce by
providing academic advice, helping
find offseason internships and mold
ing a better resume.
"They have a very good perspec
tive on what you need to do to get to
where you want to be," Slater said of
the mentors. "Being an athlete,
sometimes you miss out on the in
ternships and some of the other
things you can do during the sum
mer because we're always playing
baseball. These guys have been
there and they know what it takes to
get where we want to be. It's great to
have that resource."
For professional baseball play
ers, staying connected and keeping a
resume up to date can mean the dif
ference between having a j ob in a few
years and being unemployed should
their baseball careers not pan out.
Romanczuk, the mentors and Mar
quess all hope that the program pro
vides connections and insight that
will keep players thinking about
their post-baseball lives during their
careers and land the players jobs
once their careers end.
"They're all focused on baseball,
but for a majority of them it's not
going to work out," Marquess said.
"If you're 28 years old and you

haven't even thought about it, you're
losing out. I use a story of guy who's
30 years old, a Stanford grad, he
goes in and has great academic cre
dentials and goes to an interview and
they say, 'you've been doing what for
the last eight years?' Doesn't make
any sense, they don't know about
baseball."
♦ ♦♦
Marquess has coached the Cardi
nal to 14 College World Series ap
pearances, two national champi
onships and 1,525 wins in his 38
years at the helm of Stanford base
ball, while winning three NCAA
Coach of the Year awards, nine Pac
-10 Coach of the Year awards and
even a gold medal at the 1988
Olympics as head coach of the USA
Olympic baseball team.
Yet his legacy might be more de
fined by another stat: Of the 56 for
mer student-athletes he has coached
that have reached the MLB, 48 have
earned them college degrees. In a
world in which only 4.3 percent of
MLB players have college degrees,
86 percent of Marquess' former
players that reached the MLB have
their college degree.
"One of my proudest achieve
ments is being able to go back [to
Stanford] and finish," Castro said.
"Being so close once I did leave, I
never really thought of it as anything
other than when I had the time to go
back and do it. It was something that
I was always going to do."
It's extremely difficult to reach
the major leagues in baseball as a
career minor leaguer who never
reached the majors himself, Mar
quess knows that. With that in mind,
Marquess has created a powerhouse
program that not only succeeds on
the field each year, but prepares
players for any situation they might
face after their Stanford careers
on or off the baseball field.
Regardless of how their profes
sional careers turn out and when
they choose to leave Stanford, Car
dinal baseball players can look for
ward to a bright future thanks to
Marquess and the program he has
established.
"The good thing about the Stan
ford family is that everybody out
there wants to help," Marquess said.
There may be no one who wants
to help more than Marquess himself.

Every baseball player dreams of
reaching the major leagues. From
little league to high school to college,
the ultimate goal remains the same:
to hear your name called in the
MLB draft and ascend to the major
league level.
However, unlike most American
sports leagues, the MLB dream is
not completed on the day of the
draft. Those who are drafted in the
first round of the NBA and NFL
drafts are virtually guaranteed at
least a year or two with their respec
tive teams and play at the highest
level in their first year. It's unheard
of for a first-round pick in the NBA
and NFL to never don the team's
uniform for at least a single game.
In baseball, though, the reality is
much different. Only 73 percent of
first-round picks in the MLB draft
ever play a day in the major leagues,
with the other 27 percent becoming
career minor league players. Con
sidering all rounds, only one in six
players selected in the MLB draft
will ever make it to the maj or league
level, and one in 20 draftees will be
come "regulars," or someone who
plays for three years or more.

potentially after the prime of his ca

(378 of 750 players) of the players
make $2 million or more per season.

by Marquess and the Stanford base
ball program doesn't end with the
additional requirements, either.
In the fall of 2013, former Stan
ford baseball pitcher Mark Ro
manczuk decided to start an alumni
mentorship program for the cur
rent student-athletes of Stanford
baseball that was readily approved
by Marquess. Romanczuk, who
ranks sixth all-time in Stanford his
tory with 28 career wins, had been a
beneficiary of Marquess' academic
approach as he returned to the
Farm in 2006 and graduated with a
degree in economics after leaving
Stanford to sign with the Arizona Di
amondbacks following his junior sea
son in 2005.

After playing four years of minor
league baseball, Romanczuk transi
tioned from professional baseball to
the world of finance in 2009 and faced
several challenges along the way.
Throughout the process, he noted
how beneficial it would have been to
have someone who had gone through
the same situations before to guide
him. His journey inspired him to help
current Cardinal baseball players
become prepared for the situations
they will face after Stanford.
"With so many talented Stanford
student-athletes who have excelled
in careers post-professional sports, I
recognized the value of creating a
platform to connect current Stan
ford baseball players with former
student-athletes in their targeted
post-athletics careers," Romanczuk
said.
What started from the experi
ences of one former player and cur
rent Goldman Sachs employee has
now developed into a program that
matches any interested Stanford
baseball player with a Stanford
baseball alumnus in the same aca
demic field. The alumnus can help
guide the player as he prepares for
both a potential baseball career and
a future career in the workforce by
providing academic advice, helping
find offseason internships and mold
ing a better resume.
"They have a very good perspec
tive on what you need to do to get to
where you want to be," Slater said of
the mentors. "Being an athlete,
sometimes you miss out on the in
ternships and some of the other
things you can do during the sum
mer because we're always playing
baseball. These guys have been
there and they know what it takes to
get where we want to be. It's great to
have that resource."
For professional baseball play
ers, staying connected and keeping a
resume up to date can mean the dif
ference between having a j ob in a few
years and being unemployed should
their baseball careers not pan out.
Romanczuk, the mentors and Mar
quess all hope that the program pro
vides connections and insight that
will keep players thinking about
their post-baseball lives during their
careers and land the players jobs
once their careers end.
"They're all focused on baseball,
but for a majority of them it's not
going to work out," Marquess said.
"If you're 28 years old and you

haven't even thought about it, you're
losing out. I use a story of guy who's
30 years old, a Stanford grad, he
goes in and has great academic cre
dentials and goes to an interview and
they say, 'you've been doing what for
the last eight years?' Doesn't make
any sense, they don't know about
baseball."

Marquess has coached the Cardi
nal to 14 College World Series ap
pearances, two national champi
onships and 1,525 wins in his 38
years at the helm of Stanford base
ball, while winning three NCAA
Coach of the Year awards, nine Pac
-10 Coach of the Year awards and
even a gold medal at the 1988
Olympics as head coach of the USA
Olympic baseball team.
Yet his legacy might be more de
fined by another stat: Of the 56 for
mer student-athletes he has coached
that have reached the MLB, 48 have
earned them college degrees. In a
world in which only 4.3 percent of
MLB players have college degrees,
86 percent of Marquess' former
players that reached the MLB have
their college degree.
"One of my proudest achieve
ments is being able to go back [to
Stanford] and finish," Castro said.
"Being so close once I did leave, I
never really thought of it as anything
other than when I had the time to go
back and do it. It was something that
I was always going to do."
It's extremely difficult to reach
the major leagues in baseball as a
career minor leaguer who never
reached the majors himself, Mar
quess knows that. With that in mind,
Marquess has created a powerhouse
program that not only succeeds on
the field each year, but prepares
players for any situation they might
face after their Stanford careers
on or off the baseball field.
Regardless of how their profes
sional careers turn out and when
they choose to leave Stanford, Car
dinal baseball players can look for
ward to a bright future thanks to
Marquess and the program he has
established.
"The good thing about the Stan
ford family is that everybody out
there wants to help," Marquess said.
There may be no one who wants
to help more than Marquess himself.

Every baseball player dreams of
reaching the major leagues. From
little league to high school to college,
the ultimate goal remains the same:
to hear your name called in the
MLB draft and ascend to the major
league level.
However, unlike most American
sports leagues, the MLB dream is
not completed on the day of the
draft. Those who are drafted in the
first round of the NBA and NFL
drafts are virtually guaranteed at
least a year or two with their respec
tive teams and play at the highest
level in their first year. It's unheard
of for a first-round pick in the NBA
and NFL to never don the team's
uniform for at least a single game.
In baseball, though, the reality is
much different. Only 73 percent of
first-round picks in the MLB draft
ever play a day in the major leagues,
with the other 27 percent becoming
career minor league players. Con
sidering all rounds, only one in six
players selected in the MLB draft
will ever make it to the maj or league
level, and one in 20 draftees will be
come "regulars," or someone who
plays for three years or more.
Adding to the difficulty, once a
baseball player reaches the big
leagues, he cannot become a free
agent and competitively negotiate a
contract until six years have passed,
potentially after the prime of his ca
reer. As such, although the MLB
has become known for the mega
contracts of Alex Rodriguez, Albert
Pujols and others, only about half
(378 of 750 players) of the players
make $2 million or more per season.
The odds of becoming an estab
lished major leaguer are slim at
best, even if a player is drafted. Yet
despite the likely need for a career
change, college degrees are rare
finds among professional baseball
players. According to the College
Sport Research Institute, college
baseball players graduate at rates
31.29 percent lower than the aver
age male graduation rate. Pac-12
players, meanwhile, graduate at

rates 44.3 percent lower than the
Pac-12's average male graduation
rate. Additionally, only 4.3 percent
of MLB players have a college de
gree.
Despite the success of NCAA
student-athletes graduating as a
whole, college baseball remains
troubled with graduation issues due
to the fact that college baseball play
ers can be drafted and leave after
their junior years, similarly to in col
lege football. Yet unlike football
players, the baseball players that
leave early after being drafted may
never play a day in the big leagues.

Over 20 years ago, Stanford
baseball head coach Mark Marquess
recognized that something needed

to change.
"The two guys where I really
changed my theory were Jeffrey
Hammonds and Ed Sprague," Mar
quess shared. "Both were first
round picks and both were in the big
leagues within a year and a half and
both played for years in the big
leagues, but both didn't get their
Stanford degrees because when
you're a position player and you go
out and play in the summer, they
want you to go to winter league or
they want you to go to instructional
ball and they pay you a million dol
lars so you can't say no.
"All of a sudden you never get a
chance to go back to school and

In the 1990s, head coach Mark Marquess (above) began the
conversation with Stanford's athletic directors on how to get players
their degrees efficiently despite leaving their junior year for the pros.

Junior Austin Slater (above) could be a potential early-round MLB draft pick this week. Slater was drafted
out of high school to the LA Dodgers but turned down the offer in order to play for the Stanford Cardinal.
you're in the big leagues, you've made
a lot of money, so you don't really need
[the degree], but I said, 'what a sin
that you go there for three years and
you don't get your Stanford degree,"'
he added.
Hammonds, the fourth overall
pick in the 1992 Draft by the Balti
more Orioles and recent Stanford
Hall of Fame inductee, and Sprague,
the 25th overall pick in the 1988 Draft
by the Toronto Blue Jays, both defied
the odds and lasted past their first six
years in the major leagues and were
able to negotiate free-agent con
tracts. A .272 lifetime hitter with 110
home runs over his 13-year career,
Hammonds made more than enough
money to provide for himself and his
family. Similarly, Sprague's 11-year
career saw him hit 152 home runs.
But when then careers ended in then
mid-to-late 30s, what came next?
"When [Hammonds] was with the
Giants towards the end of his career,
he came over and met with his advisor
or somebody in his department and
figured out what he needed to gradu
ate," Marquess said. "He got out of
baseball and lived in Florida with his
wife and a couple young kids. He
would fly out here Sunday night, rent
ed a townhouse in Palo Alto and flew
home on Thursday to come back and
get his degree."
Indeed, Hammonds returned to
Stanford and earned his degree over
a decade after he originally attended
the university but not without obsta
cles. Not only was he years removed
from taking classes, but he had a fam
ily to care for.
"He's the guy that I changed [the
program for] because it was unfair,"
Marquess said. "He was on time [to
graduate] but he had to come back
and get his degree. I'm really proud of
him."
In the 19905, Marquess began
talks with Stanford's athletic advisors
to determine what could be done to
prevent Hammonds' situation from

reoccurring and to help players get
their college degrees even if they
chose to leave after then* junior sea
sons. A plan was quickly struck that
consisted of Stanford baseball play
ers taking an extra class during their
fall or winter quarters, or both, to get
ahead. That way, by the time then
junior year ended, baseball players
would be at least a quarter ahead and
would only need two more quarters,
at most, to complete then* degrees.
This plan has been in action ever
since.
'A typical fall is somewhere be
tween 18 and 20 units, winter is some
where between 16 and 20 units, de
pending on what year you are, and
usually freshman try to take closer to
20," said junior outfielder Austin
Slater. "Then during spring usually
it's 12 to 15 units, somewhere in
there."
Marquess' academic strategy has
been wildly successful since it was ini
tially instituted. Every Stanford
baseball player is required to be at
least a quarter ahead by the end of his
junior year, leaving only two quarters
left to complete his degree.
If a player then leaves after his
junior year for the MLB draft, which
has become a common trend through
out college baseball, the amount of
classes left to earn his degree would
be cut down by at least an entire quar
ter. This is a significant amount to a
professional baseball player when the
fall and winter are so valuable for in
structional offseason baseball that
might be required for minor leaguers
and the spring and summer coincide
with baseball season.
It's nearly impossible to fit more
than one quarter in per year for a pro
fessional baseball player even one
quarter may be difficult so cutting
down the number of quarters re
quired by one helps players earn
their degrees at least a year sooner.
"Having three quarters makes it
kind of a daunting task to come back,"
said Slater, who, as a top-100 prospect
according to ESPN, may choose to
leave after this season. "But having
only two, you could finish it in a fall
and a winter or split it up into two
falls."

"I've played with guys [in the
MLB] who had two years' worth of
classes roughly after they get drafted
and signed," said Houston Astros
catcher and Stanford alumnus Jason
Castro 'O9. "That makes it a little
more difficult and a little more daunt
ing to try and tackle in the middle of
an offseason. But when you're so
close and you only have to go back and
take a few classes to finish, it makes it
a little more manageable and not such
a large task to take on."
Although Castro left Stanford
after being drafted with the 10th
overall pick in the 2008 Draft by the
Astros, he never forgot about his
earning his degree. He was only 25
units away from completion, and de
spite successfully making it to the
major leagues, he came back twice to
complete a quarter in the fall, official
ly earning his degree in Sociology this
past December and entering the
ranks of the 4.3 percent of MLB play
ers with a college degree.
Similarly, former Stanford base
ball players Drew Storen and Austin
Wilson have been seen on campus re
cently as they returned to complete
their degrees. Former Cardinal play
ers that left school a year early for
baseball continue to flock back to
school to earn then* degrees, thanks
in large part to the fact that fall quar
ter generally aligns with the baseball
offseason.
Even for the juniors that choose to
stay for their senior year, it provides a
nice little bonus for senior year a
spring quarter full of baseball and
with no classes. Current seniors
Brant Whiting, A.J. Vanegas and
Brett Michael Doran graduated after
winter quarter and enjoyed the ideal
senior spring this quarter.
While other schools across the na
tion try to ease the academic loads
athletes face, Marquess instead
chooses to prioritize both academics
and athletics, refusing to compromise
the baseball players' futures for the
sake of baseball.
'As I tell the parents, I don't know
if they'll be a major league player for
15 years, but I do know they'll get
their Stanford degree," Marquess
said.

The process of spurring players
towards an early graduation begins
before they even step foot on campus.
"When you're getting recruited
here, [Marquess] makes it clear that
he expects all of us to be at least a
quarter ahead, some of us two quar
ters ahead," Slater said.
"To have people around you who
are trying to help guide you in the
right direction and making sure you
are doing the right things to be suc
cessful, that was a huge help right off
the bat," Castro added.
Unlike some programs that en
courage baseball players to take easi
er classes, Marquess doesn't restrict
the majors of his players, claiming
that the idea that a student-athlete
can't major in a specific area because
he plays baseball "is ridiculous." In
fact, many of his current players are
majoring in human biology or engi
neering. That includes senior Danny
Diekroeger and junior Luke Pappas,
who are both majoring in computer
science and boast a 3.8 GPA and a 4.0
GPA, respectively.
"Coach Marquess does a great job
of allowing us to pursue any major
that we want and scheduling practice
around our classes as opposed to us
doing the opposite and scheduling our
classes around practice," Slater said.
"He gives us a lot of freedom to pur
sue our academic interests and it pays
off, and we understand that and we
put in the work to make sure that we
are ahead and we are able to come
back and finish."
The extra classes come at a cost
not for the players, but for the coach
es. Marquess readily admits that it is
impossible to have players take so
many units and also get them all out
on the baseball field in the afternoon
at the same time. There is not a day
during the week in which every play
er can make a 2:30 or 3:30 afternoon
practice because of class.
Instead, the coaching staff works
individually with players on their own
schedule, sacrificing more of their
time so that the students can shape
their athletic commitments around
academics, and not the other way
around.
"I love when they were talking
about 8:30 classes and all the under
grads went fruitcake, saying 'are you
kidding me?' You know, it's hard when
you don't have 8 o'clock class to get it
in and to do the sport," said Marquess
about the inability to bring all the
players together at once.
Of course, a common worry sur
rounding the program is whether
the extra classes burden the players
too much and prevent them from
playing their best baseball during
their time at Stanford. Twenty-unit
quarters are no easy task, whether
the student is an athlete or not.
"Sometimes during the fall, fall
and winter, when we're amped up on
practice, it's tough when you're tak
ing 18 or 20 units," Slater said. "Be
tween four and five hour practices a
day and doing your work, it's tough
but it definitely pays off when you're
sitting at this point that I am right
now and you're looking at only two
quarters left next year."
To counter the added load, Mar
quess and the athletic advisors gen
erally recommend that baseball
players take an extra class that isn't
in their major and can be taken pass
fail. The multiple College World Se
ries appearances since the new aca
demic requirements were imple
mented prove that the academic load
doesn't stop student-athletes from
excelling on the baseball field as well.
