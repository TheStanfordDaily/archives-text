# Addressing needs of student-athletes
## 
### 
Last quarter, I boked into the sub
ject of what it means to be a stu
dent-athlete at Stanford. After
taking a cbss this past quarter
bught by Dr. Hans Sterner on the
mental health of collegiate athlet
ics, I felt that it would be worth
while b delve further into the spe
cific probbms such as school
versus sport, coach-player dy
namics, mental health, nutrition
and injuries that, arise for stu
dent-athletes, and how the Athlet
ic Department and the Athletic
Academic Resource Center
(AARC) address those problems.

Of the 213 athletes
from 25 varsity
sports that respond
ed to a survey con
ducted by Psych 78Q:
The Mental Health of Collegiate
Athletes, 83 percent wished that
their team had a sports nutritionist,
73 percent said they wanted a sports
specific psychologist and only about
40 percent agreed that they felt com
fortable approaching their coach
with questions and concerns. The
Emotional Well-Being and Assess

ment of Campus Resources Survey
initiated by senior rower Christi
na Bax led to a presentation to
various members of the Athletic and
Psychiatry Departments and the
AARC on how the student-athlete
experience could be improved.

It's no secret that student-ath
letes often have to miss class time,
midterms and finals in order to com
pete for their teams. Some profes
sors are accommodating and are able
to work things out with the student;
however, other discussions require

outside intervention that's where
the AARC comes in to mitigate
the tension between academic and
athletic pursuits.
"We are uniquely aware of the
different challenges that student
athletes face on campus," said Austin

Lee ' 02, an advisor for the AARC
and former Cardinal football player.
"Our role and expertise is to advise
student-athletes in the context of
how Stanford students should be ad
vised but with a knowledge of what
their lives are like as student-ath
letes and all of the NCAA rules and
regulations that they have to adhere
to with their academic progress."
Besides coping with varying lev
els of accommodations from profes
sors, athletes must also find the time
to fit in required classes for their
major between practices. Often,
class times are set for departmental
reasons and cannot be adjusted, so it
becomes crucial for the AARC advi
sors to have an open conversation be
tween coaches and players in order
to create opportunities for students
to take those classes, whether it be
taking the class another quarter,
shifting practice times, or staying on
an extra quarter after graduation to
complete the major.
The accommodations vary by
team, however. A sport with as many
athletes as football must set parame
ters for practice time; however, a
sport like golf, with only 10 players,

Football players from Stanford's incoming class of 2006-07 were reported by the NCAA as having a
graduation rate of 95 percent. Many athletes who leave to play professionally return to earn their degree.
