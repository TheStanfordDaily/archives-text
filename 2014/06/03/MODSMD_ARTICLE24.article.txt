# Addressing needs of student-athletes
## 
### 
Last quarter, I boked into the sub
ject of what it means to be a stu
dent-athlete at Stanford. After
taking a cbss this past quarter
bught by Dr. Hans Sterner on the
mental health of collegiate athlet
ics, I felt that it would be worth
while b delve further into the spe
cific probbms such as school
versus sport, coach-player dy
namics, mental health, nutrition
and injuries that, arise for stu
dent-athletes, and how the Athlet
ic Department and the Athletic
Academic Resource Center
(AARC) address those problems.

Of the 213 athletes
from 25 varsity
sports that respond
ed to a survey con
ducted by Psych 78Q:
The Mental Health of Collegiate
Athletes, 83 percent wished that
their team had a sports nutritionist,
73 percent said they wanted a sports
specific psychologist and only about
40 percent agreed that they felt com
fortable approaching their coach
with questions and concerns. The
Emotional Well-Being and Assess

ment of Campus Resources Survey
initiated by senior rower Christi
na Bax led to a presentation to
various members of the Athletic and
Psychiatry Departments and the
AARC on how the student-athlete
experience could be improved.

It's no secret that student-ath
letes often have to miss class time,
midterms and finals in order to com
pete for their teams. Some profes
sors are accommodating and are able
to work things out with the student;
however, other discussions require

outside intervention that's where
the AARC comes in to mitigate
the tension between academic and
athletic pursuits.
"We are uniquely aware of the
different challenges that student
athletes face on campus," said Austin

Lee ' 02, an advisor for the AARC
and former Cardinal football player.
"Our role and expertise is to advise
student-athletes in the context of
how Stanford students should be ad
vised but with a knowledge of what
their lives are like as student-ath
letes and all of the NCAA rules and
regulations that they have to adhere
to with their academic progress."
Besides coping with varying lev
els of accommodations from profes
sors, athletes must also find the time
to fit in required classes for their
major between practices. Often,
class times are set for departmental
reasons and cannot be adjusted, so it
becomes crucial for the AARC advi
sors to have an open conversation be
tween coaches and players in order
to create opportunities for students
to take those classes, whether it be
taking the class another quarter,
shifting practice times, or staying on
an extra quarter after graduation to
complete the major.
The accommodations vary by
team, however. A sport with as many
athletes as football must set parame
ters for practice time; however, a
sport like golf, with only 10 players,

Football players from Stanford's incoming class of 2006-07 were reported by the NCAA as having a
graduation rate of 95 percent. Many athletes who leave to play professionally return to earn their degree.
might have practice times adjusted
to the athletes' schedules. Men's vol
leyball, for example, holds practices
from 7-10 p.m. so that the players
have fewer restrictions on what
classes they can take.
"We [at the AARC] do as much as
we can to educate athletes about
[NCAA] requirements and at the
same time put systems in place that
allow them to have a similar experi
ence to the rest of the student popu
lation. So we don't have priority reg
istration for athletes here, they may
ask for it, but they're never going to
get it," Lee said. "If there isn't flexi
bility [with a section time] then
maybe you don't take the class that
quarter. But we have heard stories
where a professor would shift those
times or consult with us."
Lee asserts that because athletes
are forced to manage their time so
wisely in order to get assignments
done and study for exams in their
small amount of down time, many
professors confess that some of their
most organized and dedicated stu
dents are athletes.
According to NCAA statistics re
leased on Stanford's incoming class
of 2006-2007, the student-athlete
graduation rate was 93 percent, just
two percent shy of that of the entire
student population. That number
even excludes athletes who come
back to Stanford to complete their
degree after competing profession
ally. Lee explained that he's even ad
vised some of his former teammates
who have returned to the Farm.
"The majority of the faculty is un
derstanding and respects the stu
dent-athlete and is willing to work
with them. They earned their way
into Stanford through the admis
sions process, so it's not like they're
dumb jocks taking up spots," said
senior associate athletic director and
former Stanford basketball player
Earl Koberlein ' 87. "If there was
ever an academic scandal here or
student-athletes not graduating
then we lose all credibility and we
have a lot harder time. It's incum
bent upon us and the student-ath
letes to keep those standards up and
graduation rates and going to class,
being integrated into the class
room."
One student-athlete astutely
pointed out that "we are student
athletes, not athlete-students" and
so many of them place the greatest
emphasis on schoolwork. Often, the
ambition of a student-athlete will
lead him or her to overload on activi
ties in order to take advantage of
Stanford, taking on extra units,
working in a lab, writing a thesis,
shadowing as an intern, and TA-ing
in addition to practice, as one
women's rower did this year.
Ultimately, the load of stress
could affect performance as well,
which is why it is crucial that coaches
understand these pressures for ath
letes to perform both athletically
and academically. One athlete
claimed that much of the suffering of
student-athletes stems from dissat
isfaction with coaches because there
isn't an open forum for communica
tion.

"The senior athletic directors
who hire and oversee the coaches,
part of their job is to make sure the
coaches that they bring to campus
embrace the experiences that the
students are going to have and the
commitments academically," Lee
said. "If you're not going to embrace
the opportunities that the students
have [outside of sport] then it's going
to be difficult for you as a coach."
The associate athletic directors
oversee the relationships among the
players, coaches, and trainers within
the teams that they are responsible
for, encouraging open discussions to
monitor the overall student-athlete
experience. They work to look into
any issues that may arise with the
student-athlete in regards to their
sport or coaches and also work with
the coaches on the overall function
ing of the team.
"It's all about communication
from the coaches and the athletes
and I think that's a challenge be
cause some student-athletes, espe
cially when you're 18 years old, can
come in and say 'wow, there's an ad
ministrator that I don't really know
and I'm intimidated by my coach and
I don't know who to talk to,"' Kober
lein said. "And so I'm at their prac
tices and I break down that barrier."
Injuries are another topic of con
cern for athletes and a difficult con
versation to have with coaches. Ath
letes push them limits in regards to
injuries, often ignoring their injuries
for fear of losing playing time or his
or her position, as was the case for
one rower who rowed through an in
jury and straight into a broken rib.
"I don't care if you're Andrew
Luck and it's the fourth quarter, if
the doctor says you're out, then
you're out and they [the medical
staff] have the ultimate say," Kober
lein said. "Any student athlete who is
driven wants to play, and so they'll
mask injuries because they want to
play. It's intrinsic that they're going
to try to fight through pain because
they think, 'I don't want to sit the
bench because it's a big game.'"
Because of this, students of Psych
78Q suggested that athletics coaches
be required to take a class so that
people in positions of power might
better understand the mental health
issues surrounding student-athletes
and the pressures that they are put
under to perform on and off the field.
"We do our best to fit into the
larger infrastructure of campus re
sources for mental health. We con
tinue to evaluate opportunities to
provide further support in sport psy
chology," said senior associate ath
letic director of external relations
and former Stanford golfer Kevin
Blue ' 05. "We try to stay on top of
this. We had a coaches meeting this
morning with a speaker with ideas
and concepts that coaching staff can
continue to use and work on as far as
being able to develop resilience in
their teams."
There may be the perception
among student-athletes that the
Athletic Department works for the
University in order to maintain the
standards of excellence of Stanford
Athletics and to ensure more NCAA
titles and Directors' Cups. However,
the athletes are not just tools where
by athletics may accomplish those
goals; everyone in the Athletic De
partment is put in place to better the
student-athlete experience and to

serve their needs, first and foremost.
"We wouldn't have a job if it
weren't for the student athletes,"
Koberlein said. "That's how I see my
role: as a resource, and how to make
their goals come true, their aspira
tions and their experience here a
great one... There are about 25 for
mer Stanford student-athletes that
work in athletics as either coaches or
staff. I think we become empathetic
to what they are going through.
When I was going here, I had no idea

that there were 200 people in the ath
letic department working for you if
you were a student-athlete."
The Athletic Department and the
AARC are the hub of resources for
the student-athletes to take advan
tage of and to either assist the stu
dent-athletes athletically and aca
demically or refer them elsewhere.
In terms of nutrition and mental is
sues, athletes are referred to Coun
seling and Psychological Services
(CAPS) or Dr. Lisa Post in the De
partment of Psychiatry, with whom
the Athletic Department has a con
tract to serve the needs of athletes.
"There is more and more recog
nition that the needs of athletes are
special and that they have a job in ad
dition to being in college and the
pressures of the media is laying a lot
more emphasis on sports and a lot
more pressure on the athletes. Stan
ford in general is a high-pressure
place," Post said. "We are hoping to
promote a more organized, umbrella
program that will have a sports psy
chologist working with teams."
There currently exists a discon
nect between the mental and physi
cal treatment of athletes on campus
even though much of sports is men
tal and played out in the mind.
Through suggestions made in the
survey conducted by Psych 78Q, ath
letes requested that athletic nutri
tionists and clinical sports psychia
trists be hired to work within the ath
letics department specifically and be
as natural to meet with as a trainer
or AARC advisor. It takes a "one-of
a-kind recipe," as one athlete put it,
to be a Stanford student-athlete and
so diverse, targeted, sport specific
resources are necessary to work
with them.
The body is the main tool in order
for student athletes to perform at
their highest level and many athletes
admitted that they didn't know how
to properly fuel their bodies for the
amount of sport that they do on a
daily basis.
"We have our Director of Sports
Performance, Brandon Marcello,
and a number of our trainers are fa
miliar with that but we don't have a
full-time nutritionist," Koberlein
said. "A lot of teams want full-time
nutritionists on staff so that they can
have more interaction with nutri
tionists regarding meals on the road,
pre-game meals and the ultimate
healthy diet for that student-athlete.
A football offensive lineman is going
to eat differently than a swimmer, so
that's another area we are going to
update as well."
In addition to a team sports nutri
tionist, having an athletic mental
health professional on staff would
help to "find solutions to the mental

blocks, fears, frustrations and stres
sors that arise when performing,
learn how to manage performance
anxiety, develop coping skills to deal
with pressures and help to create a
balanced life," according to the sug
gestions made to the Athletic De
partment in Psych 78Q.
Many of the frustrations that ath
letes feel are not known, according to
Dr. Steiner, because of athletes' high
levels of reprehensive defensiveness
the ability to minimize adversity
and move on.
For all of the complaints that ath
letes have, though, known or un
known, the survey results showed
that happiness and self-esteem lev
els are higher for athletes. Despite
the stresses, complaints and high
levels of commitment, the majority
of student-athletes are very satisfied
with their time at Stanford.
"It's our belief and philosophy
that precisely the challenge of bal
ancing and fully engaging in the
complementary experiences of try
ing to win championships and trying
to be a leading scholar... turns out
and helps refine and shape citizens
that are going to be ultimately very
productive as leaders in our society,"
Blue said. "The rigor involved in this
is substantial, but that's a helpful
formative experience as well, and
when properly supported, which we
[the Athletic Department] believe
we do a good job of, we think it is a
very strong positive for the student
athlete experience and something
that is the hallmark of what we do at
Stanford."
The athletic department, the
coaches, trainers, psychologists,
professors and academic advisors
are all put in place to benefit the stu
dent-athlete and are ready and will
ing to help in any way possible. It's
just a matter of the student-athlete
realizing this and acting upon those
resources when necessary.
"Part of our job is to make sure
that we are out in front of the stu
dents and reminding them of what
they should be doing," Lee said.
"They need to be asking questions
and making connections on campus
and that's how they're going to make
the most of them experience here. If
you're asking questions of your pro
fessors and TAs and advisors and
athletic directors then you aren't
going to be surprised and you're
going to get to the right place."
But when sport is the first thing
on student-athletes' minds in the
morning and last thing on their
minds at night, that's not necessari
ly an easy task.

Stanford student-athletes have earned 20 consecutive Directors' Cups, NCAA titles for the past 37 straight
years and countless conference titles. To earn the hardware, though, they must undergo numerous pressures.
