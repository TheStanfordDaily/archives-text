# Looking back with no regrets on a volume
## 
### Do-Hyoung Park 
Everywhere I look, I see
excellence oozing out of
my peers like the filling in
a freshly baked apple pie.
I don't need to look too far; my
roommate Avi has spent the last
year honing his web development
skills and will be one of the first em
ployees at an early-stage startup
this summer. My dear friend Nick is
currently experiencing something
he's dreamed of for a very, very long
time as an attendee of Apple's
WWDC. One of my closest new
friends, "The Kater-tot," as we call
her, will be getting a head start on
changing the world as she helps
tackle some of the biggest chal
lenges known to mankind.
Amidst peers that are doing such
incredible things with their lives in
the same timespan that I've had to
develop something like that of my
own, it's often been difficult to justify
to myself why I've spent these last
four months as the Managing Editor
of Sports at The Stanford Daily.
I can't even begin to comprehend
how many times I've asked myself
the same thing: "Is this really the
best thing to be doing with my time?"
I'm a chemical engineering
major, for heaven's sake. This job
has gotten in the way of that identity
in countless ways, from all of the
time that I'm spending writing and
editing and not reviewing lecture
material to forcing myself to get
started on problem sets at 3 a.m.
when most people have already long
since finished. It's led to tenfold
more sleepless nights than nights of
adequate sleep. It's led to my poor
GPA dropping to somewhere be
tween the third and fourth circles of
hell. It's led to bad attendance in
some classes and hastily finished
problem sets. It's impeded my aca
demic career in probably every way
possible.
Despite all that, I wouldn't have
changed a single thing about these
last few months.
The managing editor job found
me at a time of uncertainty in my life
I just didn't have the drive for
chemical engineering that I expect
ed I'd have, and I honestly didn't
know what else could even come
close to interesting me academically.
Once I got comfortable in sports, I
couldn't see myself doing anything
else for the second half of this year.
The biggest message that I'd like
to pass on to Ashley is that this job
wasn't just a job; it was a lifestyle.
When I first took the job, Sam Fish
er warned me to take the lightest
course load possible and to make
sure that I wouldn't be overextend
ing myself. Like an idiot, I decided to
do 20 units again one of the worst
decisions of my Stanford career.
But I'd gladly make that decision
again in a heartbeat given the
chance. Sure, I got my first-ever C,
but I also learned the feeling of
being in way over my head some
thing I quite arrogantly believed I
would never face that turned out
to be one of the most valuable learn
ing experiences of my life.
And all of those sleepless nights
and 60-hour weeks writing and edit
ing hundreds of pieces were well
worth it for the countless positive
experiences that they gave me.
How many 17-year-olds can say
that they were credentialed media
on the field at the 100 th Rose Bowl?
At the Los Angeles Memorial Coli
seum? For an international friendly
of the U.S. Men's Soccer Team? And
while knowing that I'd be able to
partake in those experiences alone
would have made the managing ex
perience special enough for me, they
were far from what truly made the
job so rewarding on a daily basis.
No, the true value came from the
writers and editors that poured
their efforts into the section along
side me.
I watched Michael Peterson blos
som from a desk editor with just
three stories under his belt into my
most efficient, versatile writer and a
close friend. I watched Cameron
Miller take on stories that marked
bigger and bigger challenges for
himself and emerge triumphant
every time, balancing the unforgiv
ing schedule of a Stanford student
athlete with an unparalleled quality
of golf and feature writing. Jordan
Wallach entered the volume as the
rookie; he leaves it as a capable vet
eran and the section's premier stats
wizard.
I could go on and on and on, but I
won't; I only have so much space,
after all, and for most of them, those
efforts and journeys speak for them
selves in the high quality of their
writing and editing.
And in the end, even though it's
not as lucrative or highly regarded
as computer science or engineering,
I've been able to continually justify
