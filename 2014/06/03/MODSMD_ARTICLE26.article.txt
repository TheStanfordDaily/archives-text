						look into the NCAA model

Joseph Beyda (JB): Hi, I'm Joey.
Cameron Miller (CM): Hey I'm
Cameron.
JB: And we've had... our differ
ences ... regarding the NCAA's
treatment of student-athletes over
the last couple months.
CM: But today we're sitting down in
the hopes of discussing some of
those differences, with the starting
point being the recently released
letter that Pac-12 presidents sent to
their colleagues at the other power
conferences.
JB: The letter listed a series of re
forms, addressing issues ranging
from student-athlete scholarships
and practice limits to the one-and
done rule and transfer restrictions.
CM: Some of these provisions are a
huge step in the right direction for
college athletics, as they at least
partially lift some of the most dra
conian restrictions from student
athletes and give them the seat at
the bargaining table they deserve.
However, this document is just a
start, and the details of the provi
sions need to be hammered out if
any of these changes are to result in
real, lasting change.

JB: For some background, I've been
more on the side of the NCAA and

the current system in these discus
sions so far. While I agree that we
need to take steps to make sure that
student-athletes have a viable
lifestyle for one, they shouldn't
go to bed hungry at night I've
also expressed my fears of opening
up the system entirely to salaries,
endorsement deals and the bevy of
other money sources that flow
through collegiate athletics.
The last thing we want is to ruin
the parity of college athletics with
an all-out bidding war for the top
athletes, or to further increase the
divide between the revenue and
non-revenue sports by intensifying
the monetary focus on football and
men's basketball. So I'm looking for
reforms that make the system fair
er to student-athletes, but don't en
tirely overthrow our current con
cept of amateurism.
CM: I started this discussion we're
having now with a column I wrote
back in April in which I argued that
student-athletes were, are and con
tinue to be exploited by an ama
teurism model that seeks to line the
pockets of overseers like NCAA
President Mark Emmert and con
ference commissioners.
Student-athletes, particularly
those in revenue sports, have a fun

damentally different relationship
with the universities they attend
vis-a-vis other students, and I be
lieve they need to be treated in a dif
ferent manner. I also argued that in
a world where student-athletes are
employees, their scholarships can
not be seen as compensation be
cause those scholarship dollars go
into university coffers, not the those
of the athletes. Finally, I believe that
if other university students are al
lowed to market themselves and
their talents and abilities, why
shouldn't athletes be able to do the
same? Overall, it appears to me that
the NCAA is unfairly and unjustly
restricting athletes in ways that just
don't make much sense.
JB: So now, on to the reforms speci
fied by the Pac-12 presidents last
month. As Cameron mentioned,
several of the ideas outlined in that
letter are long overdue and could be
a huge step forward for college ath
letics, if implemented.
The first three bullet points in
the letter address some of the finan
cial burdens currently placed on
student-athletes. The presidents
wrote that scholarships should
cover the full cost of a student's at
tendance, that ongoing medical care
should cover athletics-related in

juries even past graduation and that
scholarships should last long
enough for the student-athlete to
finish his or her degree. These are
all ideas that came up in our columns
and they're really no-brainers for
us.

CM: Joey and I are in total agree
ment here shocking, I know.
However, my only concern is the
phrasing "reasonable ongoing med
ical or insurance assistance." How
much help is "reasonable"? Who is
to be judge of the "reasonableness"
of the medical care provided to a
student-athlete beyond their four or
five years at the institution? These
are the types of details that could
impact the ultimate efficacy of these
provisions, should they be imple
mented.
The next set of proposals in the
letter are changes to the current
time limits student-athletes are able
to commit to them sport on a weekly
basis. These limits are often exceed
ed [with] impunity, with coaches
scheduling "voluntary" or captain
led practices that do not count
against the 20-hour in-season rule (8
hours if off-season). These practices
are anything but optional, and
coaches squeeze through these
types of loopholes in order to pre
pare as much as they see fit. Joey
and I both agree that by strictly en
forcing these already-existing rules,
student-athletes will have more and
better opportunities to explore their
