# A 						look into the NCAA model

### DAILY SPORTS STAFF SPORTS WRITERS Cameron Miller Joseph Beyda 
Joseph Beyda (JB): Hi, I'm Joey.
Cameron Miller (CM): Hey I'm
Cameron.
JB: And we've had... our differ
ences ... regarding the NCAA's
treatment of student-athletes over
the last couple months.
CM: But today we're sitting down in
the hopes of discussing some of
those differences, with the starting
point being the recently released
letter that Pac-12 presidents sent to
their colleagues at the other power
conferences.
JB: The letter listed a series of re
forms, addressing issues ranging
from student-athlete scholarships
and practice limits to the one-and
done rule and transfer restrictions.
CM: Some of these provisions are a
huge step in the right direction for
college athletics, as they at least
partially lift some of the most dra
conian restrictions from student
athletes and give them the seat at
the bargaining table they deserve.
However, this document is just a
start, and the details of the provi
sions need to be hammered out if
any of these changes are to result in
real, lasting change.

JB: For some background, I've been
more on the side of the NCAA and

the current system in these discus
sions so far. While I agree that we
need to take steps to make sure that
student-athletes have a viable
lifestyle for one, they shouldn't
go to bed hungry at night I've
also expressed my fears of opening
up the system entirely to salaries,
endorsement deals and the bevy of
other money sources that flow
through collegiate athletics.
The last thing we want is to ruin
the parity of college athletics with
an all-out bidding war for the top
athletes, or to further increase the
divide between the revenue and
non-revenue sports by intensifying
the monetary focus on football and
men's basketball. So I'm looking for
reforms that make the system fair
er to student-athletes, but don't en
tirely overthrow our current con
cept of amateurism.
CM: I started this discussion we're
having now with a column I wrote
back in April in which I argued that
student-athletes were, are and con
tinue to be exploited by an ama
teurism model that seeks to line the
pockets of overseers like NCAA
President Mark Emmert and con
ference commissioners.
Student-athletes, particularly
those in revenue sports, have a fun

damentally different relationship
with the universities they attend
vis-a-vis other students, and I be
lieve they need to be treated in a dif
ferent manner. I also argued that in
a world where student-athletes are
employees, their scholarships can
not be seen as compensation be
cause those scholarship dollars go
into university coffers, not the those
of the athletes. Finally, I believe that
if other university students are al
lowed to market themselves and
their talents and abilities, why
shouldn't athletes be able to do the
same? Overall, it appears to me that
the NCAA is unfairly and unjustly
restricting athletes in ways that just
don't make much sense.
JB: So now, on to the reforms speci
fied by the Pac-12 presidents last
month. As Cameron mentioned,
several of the ideas outlined in that
letter are long overdue and could be
a huge step forward for college ath
letics, if implemented.
The first three bullet points in
the letter address some of the finan
cial burdens currently placed on
student-athletes. The presidents
wrote that scholarships should
cover the full cost of a student's at
tendance, that ongoing medical care
should cover athletics-related in

juries even past graduation and that
scholarships should last long
enough for the student-athlete to
finish his or her degree. These are
all ideas that came up in our columns
and they're really no-brainers for
us.

CM: Joey and I are in total agree
ment here shocking, I know.
However, my only concern is the
phrasing "reasonable ongoing med
ical or insurance assistance." How
much help is "reasonable"? Who is
to be judge of the "reasonableness"
of the medical care provided to a
student-athlete beyond their four or
five years at the institution? These
are the types of details that could
impact the ultimate efficacy of these
provisions, should they be imple
mented.
The next set of proposals in the
letter are changes to the current
time limits student-athletes are able
to commit to them sport on a weekly
basis. These limits are often exceed
ed [with] impunity, with coaches
scheduling "voluntary" or captain
led practices that do not count
against the 20-hour in-season rule (8
hours if off-season). These practices
are anything but optional, and
coaches squeeze through these
types of loopholes in order to pre
pare as much as they see fit. Joey
and I both agree that by strictly en
forcing these already-existing rules,
student-athletes will have more and
better opportunities to explore their


non-athletic interests, whether they
are social or academic.
JB: Speaking of academic, the Pac
-12 presidents also proposed that the
NCAA strengthen the postseason
requirements relating to the Aca
demic Progress Rate, which meas
ures the academic eligibility and re
tention rates of a team's athletes
over time. These are the same re
strictions that kept UConn out of the
NCAA men's basketball tourna
ment in 2012-13 of course, the
Huskies won it all the following sea
son — and everyone's favorite col
lege sports program, Stanford, has
historically thrived in the APR re
sults. Sounds good, right Cameron?
CM: Almost. While I'm not in love
with the punitive nature of the APR,
I am all for raising the standards for
student-athletes. My main issue
with the APR is the fact that it can
punish current athletes for the
transgressions of past players and
coaching regimes. This type of ex
post facto punishment is unfair, be
cause it may take away competition
opportunities for players who had
absolutely nothing to do with their
squad's low APR.
JB : That's a very good point, and the
NCAA would have to be more aware
of that effect if it increases the penal
ties associated with the APR.
Another element of the letter was
a proposal that student-athletes
have a bigger spot at the bargaining
table, both at the conference and
NCAA levels. This is an issue that
has become very prevalent recently
with the unionization discussions at
Northwestern, and we agree that it
makes sense that student-athletes
themselves should have a more pro
nounced role in governing the sys
tem. Unfortunately, the presidents
didn't specify exactly what they
think such a role would look like.
Cameron, as a runner yourself, what
do you think are some of the specific
discussions that student-athletes
could best contribute to in this re
gard?
CM: Student-athletes can be a very
productive part of the administra
tive conversation on both the confer
ence and NCAA levels. Athletes
should be able to voice their opinions
on scheduling, marketing, stipends
and any other rules frameworks that
impact their everyday lives. Not
only do them opinions need to be
heard, they need to be respected and
earnestly considered by those in po
sitions of authority. The model of the
NCAA needs to be redirected so that
its one and only focus is the student
athlete and his or her interests, and
the most effective way to do that is
providing athletes with their de
served seat at the negotiating table.
Another way that the student
athlete's best interests can be served
is significantly altering the current
transfer rules, a point that is includ
ed by the presidents in their letter.
What do you think of their sugges

tion, Joey?
JB: A lot has been made of the inher
ent hypocrisy of transfer rules. Why
should a coach or even a regular
student be able to switch locales
freely, while a student-athlete has to
get a release from his or her coach?
It's hard to disagree with the presi
dents' proposal to "liberalize" trans
fer rules, but again, it's hard to know
exactly what that entails from this
brief letter. Do they plan on doing
away with the restrictions entirely,
or merely reducing the number of
cases in which a coach has an undue
amount of say in where a student
athlete is living the best years of his
or her life? We don't know for sure
yet, but at least on the basic princi
ples that the presidents seem to sup
port, this is an issue where even I
agree with Cameron. After all, it
doesn't make much sense to call stu
dent-athletes amateurs and then im
pose professional restrictions on
what schools they attend.
CM: You'll get no argument from me
there. The NCAA cannot have it
both ways. However, I don't think
we're going to see completely eye-to
eye on this next point, which involves
the one-and-done trend in men's
basketball.
Since the NBA raised its age
limit to 19, or one year removed from
high school graduation, about a
decade ago, an increasing number of
players have entered the collegiate
ranks for one season before jumping
ship to the NBA. This pattern evi
dently concerns the Pac-12 presi
dents, who may believe that these
players are making a mockery of the
"student" half of "student-athlete".
Rirthermore, one of the underlying
motivations behind trying to keep
players in college as long as possible
is so their labor on the court can con
tinue to be turned into a profit. But
that's beside the point.
My main argument against one
and-done and the presidents' ridicu
lous threat to reinstitute freshman
ineligibility is this: Neither should
exist, because it should be the play
er's choice to decide when he wants
to enter the league, not the NBA's or
NCAA's. If they can play, they can
play, no matter their age. I'd like to
see the NBA do away with its age
limit, and let players choose for
themselves whether or not they
want to enter the draft. The onus is
on them, and unfortunately, some
will choose unwisely. The NCAA can
also toss their crazy idea of freshman
ineligibility, because it's simply un
fair to the players; if they can play, let
them play.
JB: I agree that freshman ineligibil
ity is an overreaction to the problem
at hand, but at the same time, you
put a lot of faith in the decision-mak
ing ability of 17-year-olds. This
comes back to a fundamental dis
agreement we had in some of our
earlier columns: Do we trust high
school athletes to make the correct
long-term decisions for themselves?
I'm worried that the lure of NBA
riches might sway a young
prospect's choice away from the
NCAA, and in the case of players
from disadvantaged backgrounds
who need a college education the

most in the long run, that unlikely
short-term reward will carry even
more weight.
Of course, the current one-and
done system fails to address this
issue. The player I just described
would likely enter the draft after a
year anyway not enough time to
get the benefit of a college education
while the NBAs one-size-fits-all
approach would prevent elite
prospects who had legitimate shot at
a top draft pick from pursuing their
deserved opportunities.
I'd feel a lot more comfortable
with eliminating one-and-done if
there were more educated mentors
for graduating high school players
who faced that tough decision. Con
veniently enough, the only point of
the Pac-12 presidents' letter that we
haven't discussed hits on that very
issue. Here's how they put their rec
ommendation: "Adjust existing re
strictions so that student-athletes
preparing for the next stage of their
careers are not unnecessarily de
prived of the advice and counsel of
agents and other competent profes
sionals."
This was a vague statement, but I
assume the changes they have in
mind eligibility-wise would apply to
high school athletes as well. And
even though you considered my hes
itance to leave it up to the athlete
"paternalistic" in an earlier column,
I hope you agree that these addition
al sources of guidance will reduce the
number of poor decisions made on
the whole. The one thing that still
gets me is that low-income athletes
would be less able to afford agents,
further feeding the problem I just
brought up. Any thoughts on that?
CM: I totally agree with you and the
presidents that not allowing high
school and collegiate athletes to con
sult with outside parties handicaps
their decision-making process and
might not enable them to see the
whole picture. Like you said, the let
ter's vague language doesn't allow
us to know what their precise plans
are, but I'm hoping the outcome is
freeing up student-athletes to en
gage with agents and other outside
counsel in order to better shape their
decision to turn pro or return to
school.
On the issue of one-and-done and
eliminating the NBA's age limit, I
understand your concerns about
young players being unduly influ
enced by the tantalizing money and
fame of the pros. But to take away
entirely their ability to make the de
cision for themselves is an insult to
their capacity for critical thinking.
Yes, there are some players who, if
the age limit is abolished, will igno
rantly bypass college, jump into the
NBA and flame out. But there are
others who will make a wise, calcu
lated decision that the pros are the
place for them. It is unfair to strip
those individuals of them decision
making ability simply because oth
ers won't do their due diligence. I re
alize that sounds harsh, but that's
just the way I see it. For now, I think
we'll have to agree to disagree on
this one.

However, my only concern is the
phrasing "reasonable ongoing med
ical or insurance assistance." How
much help is "reasonable"? Who is
to be judge of the "reasonableness"
of the medical care provided to a
student-athlete beyond their four or
five years at the institution? These
are the types of details that could
impact the ultimate efficacy of these
provisions, should they be imple
mented.
The next set of proposals in the
letter are changes to the current
time limits student-athletes are able
to commit to them sport on a weekly
basis. These limits are often exceed
ed [with] impunity, with coaches
scheduling "voluntary" or captain
led practices that do not count
against the 20-hour in-season rule (8
hours if off-season). These practices
are anything but optional, and
coaches squeeze through these
types of loopholes in order to pre
pare as much as they see fit. Joey
and I both agree that by strictly en
forcing these already-existing rules,
student-athletes will have more and
better opportunities to explore their


non-athletic interests, whether they
are social or academic.
JB: Speaking of academic, the Pac
-12 presidents also proposed that the
NCAA strengthen the postseason
requirements relating to the Aca
demic Progress Rate, which meas
ures the academic eligibility and re
tention rates of a team's athletes
over time. These are the same re
strictions that kept UConn out of the
NCAA men's basketball tourna
ment in 2012-13 of course, the
Huskies won it all the following sea
son — and everyone's favorite col
lege sports program, Stanford, has
historically thrived in the APR re
sults. Sounds good, right Cameron?
CM: Almost. While I'm not in love
with the punitive nature of the APR,
I am all for raising the standards for
student-athletes. My main issue
with the APR is the fact that it can
punish current athletes for the
transgressions of past players and
coaching regimes. This type of ex
post facto punishment is unfair, be
cause it may take away competition
opportunities for players who had
absolutely nothing to do with their
squad's low APR.
JB : That's a very good point, and the
NCAA would have to be more aware
of that effect if it increases the penal
ties associated with the APR.
Another element of the letter was
a proposal that student-athletes
have a bigger spot at the bargaining
table, both at the conference and
NCAA levels. This is an issue that
has become very prevalent recently
with the unionization discussions at
Northwestern, and we agree that it
makes sense that student-athletes
themselves should have a more pro
nounced role in governing the sys
tem. Unfortunately, the presidents
didn't specify exactly what they
think such a role would look like.
Cameron, as a runner yourself, what
do you think are some of the specific
discussions that student-athletes
could best contribute to in this re
gard?
CM: Student-athletes can be a very
productive part of the administra
tive conversation on both the confer
ence and NCAA levels. Athletes
should be able to voice their opinions
on scheduling, marketing, stipends
and any other rules frameworks that
impact their everyday lives. Not
only do them opinions need to be
heard, they need to be respected and
earnestly considered by those in po
sitions of authority. The model of the
NCAA needs to be redirected so that
its one and only focus is the student
athlete and his or her interests, and
the most effective way to do that is
providing athletes with their de
served seat at the negotiating table.
Another way that the student
athlete's best interests can be served
is significantly altering the current
transfer rules, a point that is includ
ed by the presidents in their letter.
What do you think of their sugges

tion, Joey?
JB: A lot has been made of the inher
ent hypocrisy of transfer rules. Why
should a coach or even a regular
student be able to switch locales
freely, while a student-athlete has to
get a release from his or her coach?
It's hard to disagree with the presi
dents' proposal to "liberalize" trans
fer rules, but again, it's hard to know
exactly what that entails from this
brief letter. Do they plan on doing
away with the restrictions entirely,
or merely reducing the number of
cases in which a coach has an undue
amount of say in where a student
athlete is living the best years of his
or her life? We don't know for sure
yet, but at least on the basic princi
ples that the presidents seem to sup
port, this is an issue where even I
agree with Cameron. After all, it
doesn't make much sense to call stu
dent-athletes amateurs and then im
pose professional restrictions on
what schools they attend.
CM: You'll get no argument from me
there. The NCAA cannot have it
both ways. However, I don't think
we're going to see completely eye-to
eye on this next point, which involves
the one-and-done trend in men's
basketball.
Since the NBA raised its age
limit to 19, or one year removed from
high school graduation, about a
decade ago, an increasing number of
players have entered the collegiate
ranks for one season before jumping
ship to the NBA. This pattern evi
dently concerns the Pac-12 presi
dents, who may believe that these
players are making a mockery of the
"student" half of "student-athlete".
Rirthermore, one of the underlying
motivations behind trying to keep
players in college as long as possible
is so their labor on the court can con
tinue to be turned into a profit. But
that's beside the point.
My main argument against one
and-done and the presidents' ridicu
lous threat to reinstitute freshman
ineligibility is this: Neither should
exist, because it should be the play
er's choice to decide when he wants
to enter the league, not the NBA's or
NCAA's. If they can play, they can
play, no matter their age. I'd like to
see the NBA do away with its age
limit, and let players choose for
themselves whether or not they
want to enter the draft. The onus is
on them, and unfortunately, some
will choose unwisely. The NCAA can
also toss their crazy idea of freshman
ineligibility, because it's simply un
fair to the players; if they can play, let
them play.
JB: I agree that freshman ineligibil
ity is an overreaction to the problem
at hand, but at the same time, you
put a lot of faith in the decision-mak
ing ability of 17-year-olds. This
comes back to a fundamental dis
agreement we had in some of our
earlier columns: Do we trust high
school athletes to make the correct
long-term decisions for themselves?
I'm worried that the lure of NBA
riches might sway a young
prospect's choice away from the
NCAA, and in the case of players
from disadvantaged backgrounds
who need a college education the

most in the long run, that unlikely
short-term reward will carry even
more weight.
Of course, the current one-and
done system fails to address this
issue. The player I just described
would likely enter the draft after a
year anyway not enough time to
get the benefit of a college education
while the NBAs one-size-fits-all
approach would prevent elite
prospects who had legitimate shot at
a top draft pick from pursuing their
deserved opportunities.
I'd feel a lot more comfortable
with eliminating one-and-done if
there were more educated mentors
for graduating high school players
who faced that tough decision. Con
veniently enough, the only point of
the Pac-12 presidents' letter that we
haven't discussed hits on that very
issue. Here's how they put their rec
ommendation: "Adjust existing re
strictions so that student-athletes
preparing for the next stage of their
careers are not unnecessarily de
prived of the advice and counsel of
agents and other competent profes
sionals."
This was a vague statement, but I
assume the changes they have in
mind eligibility-wise would apply to
high school athletes as well. And
even though you considered my hes
itance to leave it up to the athlete
"paternalistic" in an earlier column,
I hope you agree that these addition
al sources of guidance will reduce the
number of poor decisions made on
the whole. The one thing that still
gets me is that low-income athletes
would be less able to afford agents,
further feeding the problem I just
brought up. Any thoughts on that?
CM: I totally agree with you and the
presidents that not allowing high
school and collegiate athletes to con
sult with outside parties handicaps
their decision-making process and
might not enable them to see the
whole picture. Like you said, the let
ter's vague language doesn't allow
us to know what their precise plans
are, but I'm hoping the outcome is
freeing up student-athletes to en
gage with agents and other outside
counsel in order to better shape their
decision to turn pro or return to
school.
On the issue of one-and-done and
eliminating the NBA's age limit, I
understand your concerns about
young players being unduly influ
enced by the tantalizing money and
fame of the pros. But to take away
entirely their ability to make the de
cision for themselves is an insult to
their capacity for critical thinking.
Yes, there are some players who, if
the age limit is abolished, will igno
rantly bypass college, jump into the
NBA and flame out. But there are
others who will make a wise, calcu
lated decision that the pros are the
place for them. It is unfair to strip
those individuals of them decision
making ability simply because oth
ers won't do their due diligence. I re
alize that sounds harsh, but that's
just the way I see it. For now, I think
we'll have to agree to disagree on
this one.

Contact Joseph Beyda at
jbeyda@stanford.edu and Cameron
Miller at cmiller6@stanford.edu.
Joseph Beyda (JB): Hi, I'm Joey.
Cameron Miller (CM): Hey I'm
Cameron.
JB: And we've had... our differ
ences ... regarding the NCAA's
treatment of student-athletes over
the last couple months.
CM: But today we're sitting down in
the hopes of discussing some of
those differences, with the starting
point being the recently released
letter that Pac-12 presidents sent to
their colleagues at the other power
conferences.
JB: The letter listed a series of re
forms, addressing issues ranging
from student-athlete scholarships
and practice limits to the one-and
done rule and transfer restrictions.
CM: Some of these provisions are a
huge step in the right direction for
college athletics, as they at least
partially lift some of the most dra
conian restrictions from student
athletes and give them the seat at
the bargaining table they deserve.
However, this document is just a
start, and the details of the provi
sions need to be hammered out if
any of these changes are to result in
real, lasting change.

JB: For some background, I've been
more on the side of the NCAA and

the current system in these discus
sions so far. While I agree that we
need to take steps to make sure that
student-athletes have a viable
lifestyle for one, they shouldn't
go to bed hungry at night I've
also expressed my fears of opening
up the system entirely to salaries,
endorsement deals and the bevy of
other money sources that flow
through collegiate athletics.
The last thing we want is to ruin
the parity of college athletics with
an all-out bidding war for the top
athletes, or to further increase the
divide between the revenue and
non-revenue sports by intensifying
the monetary focus on football and
men's basketball. So I'm looking for
reforms that make the system fair
er to student-athletes, but don't en
tirely overthrow our current con
cept of amateurism.
CM: I started this discussion we're
having now with a column I wrote
back in April in which I argued that
student-athletes were, are and con
tinue to be exploited by an ama
teurism model that seeks to line the
pockets of overseers like NCAA
President Mark Emmert and con
ference commissioners.
Student-athletes, particularly
those in revenue sports, have a fun

damentally different relationship
with the universities they attend
vis-a-vis other students, and I be
lieve they need to be treated in a dif
ferent manner. I also argued that in
a world where student-athletes are
employees, their scholarships can
not be seen as compensation be
cause those scholarship dollars go
into university coffers, not the those
of the athletes. Finally, I believe that
if other university students are al
lowed to market themselves and
their talents and abilities, why
shouldn't athletes be able to do the
same? Overall, it appears to me that
the NCAA is unfairly and unjustly
restricting athletes in ways that just
don't make much sense.
JB: So now, on to the reforms speci
fied by the Pac-12 presidents last
month. As Cameron mentioned,
several of the ideas outlined in that
letter are long overdue and could be
a huge step forward for college ath
letics, if implemented.
The first three bullet points in
the letter address some of the finan
cial burdens currently placed on
student-athletes. The presidents
wrote that scholarships should
cover the full cost of a student's at
tendance, that ongoing medical care
should cover athletics-related in

juries even past graduation and that
scholarships should last long
enough for the student-athlete to
finish his or her degree. These are
all ideas that came up in our columns
and they're really no-brainers for
us.

CM: Joey and I are in total agree
ment here shocking, I know.
However, my only concern is the
phrasing "reasonable ongoing med
ical or insurance assistance." How

should a coach or even a regular
student be able to switch locales
freely, while a student-athlete has to
get a release from his or her coach?
It's hard to disagree with the presi
dents' proposal to "liberalize" trans
fer rules, but again, it's hard to know
exactly what that entails from this
brief letter. Do they plan on doing
away with the restrictions entirely,
or merely reducing the number of
cases in which a coach has an undue
amount of say in where a student
athlete is living the best years of his
or her life? We don't know for sure
yet, but at least on the basic princi
ples that the presidents seem to sup
port, this is an issue where even I
agree with Cameron. After all, it
doesn't make much sense to call stu
dent-athletes amateurs and then im
pose professional restrictions on
what schools they attend.
CM: You'll get no argument from me
there. The NCAA cannot have it
both ways. However, I don't think
we're going to see completely eye-to
eye on this next point, which involves
the one-and-done trend in men's
basketball.
Since the NBA raised its age
limit to 19, or one year removed from
high school graduation, about a
decade ago, an increasing number of
players have entered the collegiate
ranks for one season before jumping
ship to the NBA. This pattern evi
dently concerns the Pac-12 presi
dents, who may believe that these
players are making a mockery of the
"student" half of "student-athlete".
Rirthermore, one of the underlying
motivations behind trying to keep
players in college as long as possible
is so their labor on the court can con
tinue to be turned into a profit. But
that's beside the point.
My main argument against one
and-done and the presidents' ridicu
lous threat to reinstitute freshman
ineligibility is this: Neither should
exist, because it should be the play
er's choice to decide when he wants
to enter the league, not the NBA's or
NCAA's. If they can play, they can
play, no matter their age. I'd like to
see the NBA do away with its age
limit, and let players choose for
themselves whether or not they
want to enter the draft. The onus is
on them, and unfortunately, some
will choose unwisely. The NCAA can
also toss their crazy idea of freshman
ineligibility, because it's simply un
fair to the players; if they can play, let
them play.
JB: I agree that freshman ineligibil
ity is an overreaction to the problem
at hand, but at the same time, you
put a lot of faith in the decision-mak
ing ability of 17-year-olds. This
comes back to a fundamental dis
agreement we had in some of our
earlier columns: Do we trust high
school athletes to make the correct
long-term decisions for themselves?
I'm worried that the lure of NBA
riches might sway a young
prospect's choice away from the
NCAA, and in the case of players
from disadvantaged backgrounds
who need a college education the

most in the long run, that unlikely
short-term reward will carry even
more weight.
Of course, the current one-and
done system fails to address this
issue. The player I just described
would likely enter the draft after a
year anyway not enough time to
get the benefit of a college education
while the NBAs one-size-fits-all
approach would prevent elite
prospects who had legitimate shot at
a top draft pick from pursuing their
deserved opportunities.
I'd feel a lot more comfortable
with eliminating one-and-done if
there were more educated mentors
for graduating high school players
who faced that tough decision. Con
veniently enough, the only point of
the Pac-12 presidents' letter that we
haven't discussed hits on that very
issue. Here's how they put their rec
ommendation: "Adjust existing re
strictions so that student-athletes
preparing for the next stage of their
careers are not unnecessarily de
prived of the advice and counsel of
agents and other competent profes
sionals."
This was a vague statement, but I
assume the changes they have in
mind eligibility-wise would apply to
high school athletes as well. And
even though you considered my hes
itance to leave it up to the athlete
"paternalistic" in an earlier column,
I hope you agree that these addition
al sources of guidance will reduce the
number of poor decisions made on
the whole. The one thing that still
gets me is that low-income athletes
would be less able to afford agents,
further feeding the problem I just
brought up. Any thoughts on that?
CM: I totally agree with you and the
presidents that not allowing high
school and collegiate athletes to con
sult with outside parties handicaps
their decision-making process and
might not enable them to see the
whole picture. Like you said, the let
ter's vague language doesn't allow
us to know what their precise plans
are, but I'm hoping the outcome is
freeing up student-athletes to en
gage with agents and other outside
counsel in order to better shape their
decision to turn pro or return to
school.
On the issue of one-and-done and
eliminating the NBA's age limit, I
understand your concerns about
young players being unduly influ
enced by the tantalizing money and
fame of the pros. But to take away
entirely their ability to make the de
cision for themselves is an insult to
their capacity for critical thinking.
Yes, there are some players who, if
the age limit is abolished, will igno
rantly bypass college, jump into the
NBA and flame out. But there are
others who will make a wise, calcu
lated decision that the pros are the
place for them. It is unfair to strip
those individuals of them decision
making ability simply because oth
ers won't do their due diligence. I re
alize that sounds harsh, but that's
just the way I see it. For now, I think
we'll have to agree to disagree on
this one.

Contact Joseph Beyda at
jbeyda@stanford.edu and Cameron
Miller at cmiller6@stanford.edu.
Joseph Beyda (JB): Hi, I'm Joey.
Cameron Miller (CM): Hey I'm
Cameron.
JB: And we've had... our differ
ences ... regarding the NCAA's
treatment of student-athletes over
the last couple months.
CM: But today we're sitting down in
the hopes of discussing some of
those differences, with the starting
point being the recently released
letter that Pac-12 presidents sent to
their colleagues at the other power
conferences.
JB: The letter listed a series of re
forms, addressing issues ranging
from student-athlete scholarships
and practice limits to the one-and
done rule and transfer restrictions.
CM: Some of these provisions are a
huge step in the right direction for
college athletics, as they at least
partially lift some of the most dra
conian restrictions from student
athletes and give them the seat at
the bargaining table they deserve.
However, this document is just a
start, and the details of the provi
sions need to be hammered out if
any of these changes are to result in
real, lasting change.

JB: For some background, I've been
more on the side of the NCAA and

the current system in these discus
sions so far. While I agree that we
need to take steps to make sure that
student-athletes have a viable
lifestyle for one, they shouldn't
go to bed hungry at night I've
also expressed my fears of opening
up the system entirely to salaries,
endorsement deals and the bevy of
other money sources that flow
through collegiate athletics.
The last thing we want is to ruin
the parity of college athletics with
an all-out bidding war for the top
athletes, or to further increase the
divide between the revenue and
non-revenue sports by intensifying
the monetary focus on football and
men's basketball. So I'm looking for
reforms that make the system fair
er to student-athletes, but don't en
tirely overthrow our current con
cept of amateurism.
CM: I started this discussion we're
having now with a column I wrote
back in April in which I argued that
student-athletes were, are and con
tinue to be exploited by an ama
teurism model that seeks to line the
pockets of overseers like NCAA
President Mark Emmert and con
ference commissioners.
Student-athletes, particularly
those in revenue sports, have a fun

damentally different relationship
with the universities they attend
vis-a-vis other students, and I be
lieve they need to be treated in a dif
ferent manner. I also argued that in
a world where student-athletes are
employees, their scholarships can
not be seen as compensation be
cause those scholarship dollars go
into university coffers, not the those
of the athletes. Finally, I believe that
if other university students are al
lowed to market themselves and
their talents and abilities, why
shouldn't athletes be able to do the
same? Overall, it appears to me that
the NCAA is unfairly and unjustly
restricting athletes in ways that just
don't make much sense.
JB: So now, on to the reforms speci
fied by the Pac-12 presidents last
month. As Cameron mentioned,
several of the ideas outlined in that
letter are long overdue and could be
a huge step forward for college ath
letics, if implemented.
The first three bullet points in
the letter address some of the finan
cial burdens currently placed on
student-athletes. The presidents
wrote that scholarships should
cover the full cost of a student's at
tendance, that ongoing medical care
should cover athletics-related in

juries even past graduation and that
scholarships should last long
enough for the student-athlete to
finish his or her degree. These are
all ideas that came up in our columns
and they're really no-brainers for
us.

CM: Joey and I are in total agree
ment here shocking, I know.
However, my only concern is the
phrasing "reasonable ongoing med
ical or insurance assistance." How
much help is "reasonable"? Who is
to be judge of the "reasonableness"
of the medical care provided to a
student-athlete beyond their four or
five years at the institution? These
are the types of details that could
impact the ultimate efficacy of these
provisions, should they be imple
mented.
The next set of proposals in the
letter are changes to the current
time limits student-athletes are able
to commit to them sport on a weekly
basis. These limits are often exceed
ed [with] impunity, with coaches
scheduling "voluntary" or captain
led practices that do not count
against the 20-hour in-season rule (8
hours if off-season). These practices
are anything but optional, and
coaches squeeze through these
types of loopholes in order to pre
pare as much as they see fit. Joey
and I both agree that by strictly en
forcing these already-existing rules,
student-athletes will have more and
better opportunities to explore their


non-athletic interests, whether they
are social or academic.
JB: Speaking of academic, the Pac
-12 presidents also proposed that the
NCAA strengthen the postseason
requirements relating to the Aca
demic Progress Rate, which meas
ures the academic eligibility and re
tention rates of a team's athletes
over time. These are the same re
strictions that kept UConn out of the
NCAA men's basketball tourna
ment in 2012-13 of course, the
Huskies won it all the following sea
son — and everyone's favorite col
lege sports program, Stanford, has
historically thrived in the APR re
sults. Sounds good, right Cameron?
CM: Almost. While I'm not in love
with the punitive nature of the APR,
I am all for raising the standards for
student-athletes. My main issue
with the APR is the fact that it can
punish current athletes for the
transgressions of past players and
coaching regimes. This type of ex
post facto punishment is unfair, be
cause it may take away competition
opportunities for players who had
absolutely nothing to do with their
squad's low APR.
JB : That's a very good point, and the
NCAA would have to be more aware
of that effect if it increases the penal
ties associated with the APR.
Another element of the letter was
a proposal that student-athletes
have a bigger spot at the bargaining
table, both at the conference and
NCAA levels. This is an issue that
has become very prevalent recently
with the unionization discussions at
Northwestern, and we agree that it
makes sense that student-athletes
themselves should have a more pro
nounced role in governing the sys
tem. Unfortunately, the presidents
didn't specify exactly what they
think such a role would look like.
Cameron, as a runner yourself, what
do you think are some of the specific
discussions that student-athletes
could best contribute to in this re
gard?
CM: Student-athletes can be a very
productive part of the administra
tive conversation on both the confer
ence and NCAA levels. Athletes
should be able to voice their opinions
on scheduling, marketing, stipends
and any other rules frameworks that
impact their everyday lives. Not
only do them opinions need to be
heard, they need to be respected and
earnestly considered by those in po
sitions of authority. The model of the
NCAA needs to be redirected so that
its one and only focus is the student
athlete and his or her interests, and
the most effective way to do that is
providing athletes with their de
served seat at the negotiating table.
Another way that the student
athlete's best interests can be served
is significantly altering the current
transfer rules, a point that is includ
ed by the presidents in their letter.
What do you think of their sugges

tion, Joey?
JB: A lot has been made of the inher
ent hypocrisy of transfer rules. Why
should a coach or even a regular
student be able to switch locales
freely, while a student-athlete has to
get a release from his or her coach?

issue. Here's how they put their rec
ommendation: "Adjust existing re
strictions so that student-athletes
preparing for the next stage of their
careers are not unnecessarily de
prived of the advice and counsel of
agents and other competent profes
sionals."
This was a vague statement, but I
assume the changes they have in
mind eligibility-wise would apply to
high school athletes as well. And
even though you considered my hes
itance to leave it up to the athlete
"paternalistic" in an earlier column,
I hope you agree that these addition
al sources of guidance will reduce the
number of poor decisions made on
the whole. The one thing that still
gets me is that low-income athletes
would be less able to afford agents,
further feeding the problem I just
brought up. Any thoughts on that?
CM: I totally agree with you and the
presidents that not allowing high
school and collegiate athletes to con
sult with outside parties handicaps
their decision-making process and
might not enable them to see the
whole picture. Like you said, the let
ter's vague language doesn't allow
us to know what their precise plans
are, but I'm hoping the outcome is
freeing up student-athletes to en
gage with agents and other outside
counsel in order to better shape their
decision to turn pro or return to
school.
On the issue of one-and-done and
eliminating the NBA's age limit, I
understand your concerns about
young players being unduly influ
enced by the tantalizing money and
fame of the pros. But to take away
entirely their ability to make the de
cision for themselves is an insult to
their capacity for critical thinking.
Yes, there are some players who, if
the age limit is abolished, will igno
rantly bypass college, jump into the
NBA and flame out. But there are
others who will make a wise, calcu
lated decision that the pros are the
place for them. It is unfair to strip
those individuals of them decision
making ability simply because oth
ers won't do their due diligence. I re
alize that sounds harsh, but that's
just the way I see it. For now, I think
we'll have to agree to disagree on
this one.

jbeyda@stanford.edu and Cameron
Miller at cmiller6@stanford.edu.
Joseph Beyda (JB): Hi, I'm Joey.
Cameron Miller (CM): Hey I'm
Cameron.
JB: And we've had... our differ
ences ... regarding the NCAA's
treatment of student-athletes over
the last couple months.
CM: But today we're sitting down in
the hopes of discussing some of
those differences, with the starting
point being the recently released
letter that Pac-12 presidents sent to
their colleagues at the other power
conferences.
JB: The letter listed a series of re
forms, addressing issues ranging
from student-athlete scholarships
and practice limits to the one-and
done rule and transfer restrictions.
CM: Some of these provisions are a
huge step in the right direction for
college athletics, as they at least
partially lift some of the most dra
conian restrictions from student
athletes and give them the seat at
the bargaining table they deserve.
However, this document is just a
start, and the details of the provi
sions need to be hammered out if
any of these changes are to result in
real, lasting change.

JB: For some background, I've been
more on the side of the NCAA and

the current system in these discus
sions so far. While I agree that we
need to take steps to make sure that
student-athletes have a viable
lifestyle for one, they shouldn't
go to bed hungry at night I've
also expressed my fears of opening
up the system entirely to salaries,
endorsement deals and the bevy of
other money sources that flow
through collegiate athletics.
The last thing we want is to ruin
the parity of college athletics with
an all-out bidding war for the top
athletes, or to further increase the
divide between the revenue and
non-revenue sports by intensifying
the monetary focus on football and
men's basketball. So I'm looking for
reforms that make the system fair
er to student-athletes, but don't en
tirely overthrow our current con
cept of amateurism.
CM: I started this discussion we're
having now with a column I wrote
back in April in which I argued that
student-athletes were, are and con
tinue to be exploited by an ama
teurism model that seeks to line the
pockets of overseers like NCAA
President Mark Emmert and con
ference commissioners.
Student-athletes, particularly
those in revenue sports, have a fun

damentally different relationship
with the universities they attend
vis-a-vis other students, and I be
lieve they need to be treated in a dif
ferent manner. I also argued that in
a world where student-athletes are
employees, their scholarships can
not be seen as compensation be
cause those scholarship dollars go
into university coffers, not the those
of the athletes. Finally, I believe that
if other university students are al
lowed to market themselves and
their talents and abilities, why
shouldn't athletes be able to do the
same? Overall, it appears to me that
the NCAA is unfairly and unjustly
restricting athletes in ways that just
don't make much sense.
JB: So now, on to the reforms speci
fied by the Pac-12 presidents last
month. As Cameron mentioned,
several of the ideas outlined in that
letter are long overdue and could be
a huge step forward for college ath
letics, if implemented.
The first three bullet points in
the letter address some of the finan
cial burdens currently placed on
student-athletes. The presidents
wrote that scholarships should
cover the full cost of a student's at
tendance, that ongoing medical care
should cover athletics-related in

juries even past graduation and that
scholarships should last long
enough for the student-athlete to
finish his or her degree. These are
all ideas that came up in our columns
and they're really no-brainers for
us.

CM: Joey and I are in total agree
ment here shocking, I know.
However, my only concern is the
phrasing "reasonable ongoing med
ical or insurance assistance." How
much help is "reasonable"? Who is
to be judge of the "reasonableness"
of the medical care provided to a
student-athlete beyond their four or
five years at the institution? These
are the types of details that could
impact the ultimate efficacy of these
provisions, should they be imple
mented.
The next set of proposals in the
letter are changes to the current
time limits student-athletes are able
to commit to them sport on a weekly
basis. These limits are often exceed
ed [with] impunity, with coaches
scheduling "voluntary" or captain
led practices that do not count
against the 20-hour in-season rule (8
hours if off-season). These practices
are anything but optional, and
coaches squeeze through these
types of loopholes in order to pre
pare as much as they see fit. Joey
and I both agree that by strictly en
forcing these already-existing rules,
student-athletes will have more and
better opportunities to explore their


non-athletic interests, whether they
are social or academic.
JB: Speaking of academic, the Pac
-12 presidents also proposed that the
NCAA strengthen the postseason
requirements relating to the Aca
demic Progress Rate, which meas
ures the academic eligibility and re
tention rates of a team's athletes
over time. These are the same re
strictions that kept UConn out of the
NCAA men's basketball tourna
ment in 2012-13 of course, the
Huskies won it all the following sea
son — and everyone's favorite col
lege sports program, Stanford, has
historically thrived in the APR re
sults. Sounds good, right Cameron?
CM: Almost. While I'm not in love
with the punitive nature of the APR,
I am all for raising the standards for
student-athletes. My main issue
with the APR is the fact that it can
punish current athletes for the
transgressions of past players and
coaching regimes. This type of ex
post facto punishment is unfair, be
cause it may take away competition
opportunities for players who had
absolutely nothing to do with their
squad's low APR.
JB : That's a very good point, and the
NCAA would have to be more aware
of that effect if it increases the penal
ties associated with the APR.
Another element of the letter was
a proposal that student-athletes
have a bigger spot at the bargaining
table, both at the conference and
NCAA levels. This is an issue that
has become very prevalent recently
with the unionization discussions at
Northwestern, and we agree that it
makes sense that student-athletes
themselves should have a more pro
nounced role in governing the sys
tem. Unfortunately, the presidents
didn't specify exactly what they
think such a role would look like.
Cameron, as a runner yourself, what
do you think are some of the specific
discussions that student-athletes
could best contribute to in this re
gard?
CM: Student-athletes can be a very
productive part of the administra
tive conversation on both the confer
ence and NCAA levels. Athletes
should be able to voice their opinions
on scheduling, marketing, stipends
and any other rules frameworks that
impact their everyday lives. Not
only do them opinions need to be
heard, they need to be respected and
earnestly considered by those in po
sitions of authority. The model of the
NCAA needs to be redirected so that
its one and only focus is the student
athlete and his or her interests, and
the most effective way to do that is
providing athletes with their de
served seat at the negotiating table.
Another way that the student
athlete's best interests can be served
is significantly altering the current
transfer rules, a point that is includ
ed by the presidents in their letter.
What do you think of their sugges

tion, Joey?
JB: A lot has been made of the inher
ent hypocrisy of transfer rules. Why
should a coach or even a regular
student be able to switch locales
freely, while a student-athlete has to
get a release from his or her coach?
It's hard to disagree with the presi
dents' proposal to "liberalize" trans
fer rules, but again, it's hard to know
exactly what that entails from this
brief letter. Do they plan on doing
away with the restrictions entirely,
or merely reducing the number of
cases in which a coach has an undue
amount of say in where a student
athlete is living the best years of his
or her life? We don't know for sure
yet, but at least on the basic princi
ples that the presidents seem to sup
port, this is an issue where even I
agree with Cameron. After all, it
doesn't make much sense to call stu
dent-athletes amateurs and then im
pose professional restrictions on
what schools they attend.
CM: You'll get no argument from me
there. The NCAA cannot have it
both ways. However, I don't think
we're going to see completely eye-to
eye on this next point, which involves
the one-and-done trend in men's
basketball.
Since the NBA raised its age
limit to 19, or one year removed from
high school graduation, about a
decade ago, an increasing number of
players have entered the collegiate
ranks for one season before jumping
ship to the NBA. This pattern evi
dently concerns the Pac-12 presi
dents, who may believe that these
players are making a mockery of the
"student" half of "student-athlete".
Rirthermore, one of the underlying
motivations behind trying to keep
players in college as long as possible
is so their labor on the court can con
tinue to be turned into a profit. But
that's beside the point.
My main argument against one
and-done and the presidents' ridicu
lous threat to reinstitute freshman
ineligibility is this: Neither should
exist, because it should be the play
er's choice to decide when he wants
to enter the league, not the NBA's or
NCAA's. If they can play, they can
play, no matter their age. I'd like to
see the NBA do away with its age
limit, and let players choose for
themselves whether or not they
want to enter the draft. The onus is
on them, and unfortunately, some
will choose unwisely. The NCAA can
also toss their crazy idea of freshman
ineligibility, because it's simply un
fair to the players; if they can play, let
them play.
JB: I agree that freshman ineligibil
ity is an overreaction to the problem
at hand, but at the same time, you
put a lot of faith in the decision-mak
ing ability of 17-year-olds. This
comes back to a fundamental dis
agreement we had in some of our
earlier columns: Do we trust high
school athletes to make the correct
long-term decisions for themselves?
I'm worried that the lure of NBA
riches might sway a young
prospect's choice away from the
NCAA, and in the case of players
from disadvantaged backgrounds
who need a college education the

most in the long run, that unlikely
short-term reward will carry even
more weight.
Of course, the current one-and
done system fails to address this
issue. The player I just described
would likely enter the draft after a
year anyway not enough time to
get the benefit of a college education
while the NBAs one-size-fits-all
approach would prevent elite
prospects who had legitimate shot at
a top draft pick from pursuing their
deserved opportunities.
I'd feel a lot more comfortable
with eliminating one-and-done if
there were more educated mentors
for graduating high school players
who faced that tough decision. Con
veniently enough, the only point of
the Pac-12 presidents' letter that we
haven't discussed hits on that very
issue. Here's how they put their rec
ommendation: "Adjust existing re
strictions so that student-athletes
preparing for the next stage of their
careers are not unnecessarily de
prived of the advice and counsel of
agents and other competent profes
sionals."
This was a vague statement, but I
assume the changes they have in
