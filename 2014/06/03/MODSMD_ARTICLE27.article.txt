# VETERANS PUSH TO THE TOP
## RODGERS, WILSON LEAD TEAM 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
For the Stanford men's golf
team, the 2013-14 campaign
seemed like one of destiny. After
failing to advance to the NCAA fi
nals a season ago with a roster
loaded with experience and talent,
the Cardinal were undoubtedly on a
mission to reverse the program's
recent trend of underperformance
when the stakes were at their high
est.
By early March, everything
seemed to be coalescing: Senior
Cameron Wilson was establishing
himself as one of college golf's best,
junior Patrick Rodgers was ready
to go out on a high note after an
nouncing his intention to turn pro
fessional and the squad's depth was
filling out nicely. Head coach Con
rad Ray had it all in his squad of ex
ceptional frontrunners and strong
players to fill the 3-4 slots in good
form. It felt as though this would be
the time, the year when veteran
prowess would intersect with
youthful exuberance and create a
winning formula. And win it did.
Stanford notched the first of its
program-high six tournament vic
tories in October at the Erin Hills
Intercollegiate, dominating the 14-

team field en route to an eight-shot
win over UCLA. Rodgers collected
individual medalist honors in what
was then the sixth victory of his col
legiate career, prevailing by three
strokes in rounds of 68-72-69. Wil
son and sophomore David Boote
also flexed their muscles at the
Marquette-hosted event, finishing
T-6th at 2-under. Highly touted

freshman Jim Liu gave the Card a
fourth golfer in the top 10, coming
in at T-lOth despite beginning his
final round with a 10 on the par-5
first hole. Classmate Maverick Mc-
Nealy also squeezed into the top 25.
This was this type of depth the unit
would rely on for much of its season.
"Our guys did a nice job in then
preparation and practice gearing

up to the event, and I think that
served us well at the tournament,"
Ray said after the event. "It was
neat to see the team win and play
well with the lead [Tuesday], They
hit some smart shots, avoided trou
ble and double bogeys, which is
something we've been talking a lot
