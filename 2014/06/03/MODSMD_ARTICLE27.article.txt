# VETERANS PUSH TO THE TOP
## RODGERS, WILSON LEAD TEAM 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
For the Stanford men's golf
team, the 2013-14 campaign
seemed like one of destiny. After
failing to advance to the NCAA fi
nals a season ago with a roster
loaded with experience and talent,
the Cardinal were undoubtedly on a
mission to reverse the program's
recent trend of underperformance
when the stakes were at their high
est.
By early March, everything
seemed to be coalescing: Senior
Cameron Wilson was establishing
himself as one of college golf's best,
junior Patrick Rodgers was ready
to go out on a high note after an
nouncing his intention to turn pro
fessional and the squad's depth was
filling out nicely. Head coach Con
rad Ray had it all in his squad of ex
ceptional frontrunners and strong
players to fill the 3-4 slots in good
form. It felt as though this would be
the time, the year when veteran
prowess would intersect with
youthful exuberance and create a
winning formula. And win it did.
Stanford notched the first of its
program-high six tournament vic
tories in October at the Erin Hills
Intercollegiate, dominating the 14-

team field en route to an eight-shot
win over UCLA. Rodgers collected
individual medalist honors in what
was then the sixth victory of his col
legiate career, prevailing by three
strokes in rounds of 68-72-69. Wil
son and sophomore David Boote
also flexed their muscles at the
Marquette-hosted event, finishing
T-6th at 2-under. Highly touted

freshman Jim Liu gave the Card a
fourth golfer in the top 10, coming
in at T-lOth despite beginning his
final round with a 10 on the par-5
first hole. Classmate Maverick Mc-
Nealy also squeezed into the top 25.
This was this type of depth the unit
would rely on for much of its season.
"Our guys did a nice job in then
preparation and practice gearing

up to the event, and I think that
served us well at the tournament,"
Ray said after the event. "It was
neat to see the team win and play
well with the lead [Tuesday], They
hit some smart shots, avoided trou
ble and double bogeys, which is
something we've been talking a lot

about and they've been working on."
After failing to maintain its mo
mentum at the U.S. Collegiate
Championships later in October,
Stanford ended the month and its
four-event fall schedule on a
stronger note at the Royal Oaks In
tercollegiate. Held at the Royal Oaks
Country Club in Dallas, Texas, the
tournament featured an Oklahoma
State squad with which the Cardinal
would become very familiar. The
Cowboys easily outpaced the field,
finishing with a cumulative 36-under
score en route to a 16-stroke win
over the Card. Amazingly, OSU put
four in front of Rodgers and Wilson,
who turned-in T-Bth, 7-under per
formances to wrap up their fall
slates. Once again, Boote showed
signs that perhaps he could be a rock
in the third position for Stanford
with his 5-under, T-13th finish.
I think we were all happy with the
fall," Ray said in early December. "I
think that at this point in the year,
we're in the position where we're
working on things landmines,
roadblocks, whatever you might say
that are in our way of being at our
best in the spring. That's what our
fall schedule provided us: a great
data sample and getting a bunch of
guys experience. Eight out of our 10
players on the team saw some action
in tournament play. We played some
very good competition on some diffi
cult golf courses and in different con
ditions than we might see every day
at Stanford, so there's a ton of posi
tives after our fall campaign."
The team translated those posi
tives into spring success, taking
team medalist honors in five of its
seven tournaments leading up to the
NCAA championships. From the
middle of February to the middle of
May, the Card were nearly unstop
pable. It was a memorable stretch of
play that is not likely to be surpassed
by another Stanford squad for some
time.
The run began at The Prestige at
PGA West in the California desert,
where the picturesque course de
signed by legend Greg Norman was
said to be "challenging but fair." But
Stanford took most of the challenge
out of the team race after the first
frame, which saw the Cardinal post a
15-under 269 score to give them an
insurmountable 11-shot lead. Even a
wild rally from Washington on the
event's final day could not supplant
the Cardinal from the top of the team
leaderboard. Rodgers notched his
seventh individual win on the
strength of his first round 65 to tie
Joel Kribel '99 for the second-most
individual wins in program history.
It was more of the same at the
Southern Highlands Collegiate
Masters for Rodgers, who just days
before the event had announced his
intention to make the jump to the
professional ranks after the spring
season concluded. The decision
seemed to lift a huge weight from his
shoulders as he went on to notch his
seventh NCAA win and second con
secutive win with rounds of 74-69-74
in Las Vegas. The Cardinal lost to
host UNLV by the same margin for
them only tournament loss from Feb.
17 through May 27.
"It was great, like a small weight
lifted off my shoulders," remarked
the well-spoken Rodgers after mak
ing his professional intentions
known. "And I think it's really

showed with the way I've played. I
was able to focus on playing my best
golf and helping my team win. I've
been really comfortable and at peace
with the decision."
Stanford kept its momentum
rolling at its only home event of the
season, easily outrunning the field at
The Goodwin on the Stanford Golf
Course. Ray's group defeated sec
ond-place USC and UCLA by twen
ty ticks, with Rodgers once again
taking individual medalist honors.
His 14-under 196 put the outgoing
junior six strokes clear of his nearest
opponents and gave him his third
straight event victory. It was a good
win for both Rodgers and his team
mates.
Cameron Wilson's turn was next,
as the Cardinal's senior leader used
clutch final round putting to take
gold at April's Western Intercolle
giate, spurring his team to its third
win in four starts. This strong ending
to its regular season that gave Stan
ford the confidence it so effortlessly
exuded going into the championship
portion of its schedule.
"This was a big win for me," Wil
son said at the time. "I've been in
contention a lot this year and haven't
played poorly but haven't played
well at the end of the final rounds. To
do that this week felt great."
Rodgers, Wilson, Ray and com
pany made history at the Pac-12
Championships a few weeks later,
winning the program's first confer
ence title since 1994 in the most dom
inating of fashions. Stanford led
from the start and placed all five of
its players in the individual top 20,
annihilating its Pac-12 foes: Wash
ington was second, 15 strokes off the
pace, with two-time defending con
ference champion Cal 29 shots back.
Predictably, Rodgers finished atop
the individual leaderboard, and was
now just one behind Tiger Woods'
program record.
The Card displayed the same
type of dominance at the Eugene Re
gional, breezing through the event
without ever surrendering the team
lead. It was an important step for the
Cardinal, finally bringing some clo
sure to their heart-wrenching sev
enth-place position at the 2013
Columbus Regional. Rodgers won
again, not that his victory came as
any surprise. But it was a significant
victory, as it tied him with Woods for
the program lead in victories.
While Rodgers aimed to break
the deadlock at the NCAA Champi
onships, it was his teammate Wilson
who finished on top at Prairie Dunes,
ending his collegiate career by win
ning Stanford's third individual na
tional championship by defeating
rival Ollie Schniederjans in a third
round playoff. Also of note was
Boote, who made an impressive run
up the leaderboard in the final
round, placing T-3rd in the particu
larly competitive field.
"I was a little nervous, but more
than anything I was really excited,"
Wilson told the media after the play
off. "I was really excited for the op
portunity, and I made it a point to
just enjoy the day and everything
that came with it.
"More than anything, I was just
really loving the chance to win and
loving being here with my guys,"
Wilson continued. "Once I knew
from coach that we were doing well
in the team portion, I really didn't
feel that much pressure to win."
But the sort of depth the Cardinal
exhibited in the stroke play portion
of N CAAs did not carry over into the
match play rounds, where they were
dispatched by Oklahoma State in the

semifinals, 3-2. It was a tough break
for a team that will have a tough time
reaching the N CAA finals next year,
in large part because of Wilson and
Rodgers' departures.
Ray will now turn to Boote and
rising sophomores Liu, McNealy
and Viraat Badhwar to carry the
load in the 2014-15 campaign. Re
turnees Patrick Grimes and Do
minick Francks will also have ample
opportunity to prove their worth, as
will the three freshmen the program
will welcome. Next year will be a
telling one for Stanford, as the squad
will try to show it was and is more
than just its two frontrunners.
But the bottom line is that the
consistently great production from
Rodgers and Wilson â€”l4 collegiate
wins between the two simply can
not be replaced. All in all, repeating
their historic 2014 spring season fig
ures to be an exceedingly tough task
for the Card not impossible, but
certainly challenging.

seemed to be coalescing: Senior
Cameron Wilson was establishing
himself as one of college golf's best,
junior Patrick Rodgers was ready
to go out on a high note after an
nouncing his intention to turn pro
fessional and the squad's depth was
filling out nicely. Head coach Con
rad Ray had it all in his squad of ex
ceptional frontrunners and strong
players to fill the 3-4 slots in good
form. It felt as though this would be
the time, the year when veteran
prowess would intersect with
youthful exuberance and create a
winning formula. And win it did.
Stanford notched the first of its
program-high six tournament vic
tories in October at the Erin Hills
Intercollegiate, dominating the 14-

team field en route to an eight-shot
win over UCLA. Rodgers collected
individual medalist honors in what
was then the sixth victory of his col
legiate career, prevailing by three
strokes in rounds of 68-72-69. Wil
son and sophomore David Boote
also flexed their muscles at the
Marquette-hosted event, finishing
T-6th at 2-under. Highly touted

freshman Jim Liu gave the Card a
fourth golfer in the top 10, coming
in at T-lOth despite beginning his
final round with a 10 on the par-5
first hole. Classmate Maverick Mc-
Nealy also squeezed into the top 25.
This was this type of depth the unit
would rely on for much of its season.
"Our guys did a nice job in then
preparation and practice gearing

up to the event, and I think that
served us well at the tournament,"
Ray said after the event. "It was
neat to see the team win and play
well with the lead [Tuesday], They
hit some smart shots, avoided trou
ble and double bogeys, which is
something we've been talking a lot

about and they've been working on."
After failing to maintain its mo
mentum at the U.S. Collegiate
Championships later in October,
Stanford ended the month and its
four-event fall schedule on a
stronger note at the Royal Oaks In
tercollegiate. Held at the Royal Oaks
Country Club in Dallas, Texas, the
tournament featured an Oklahoma
State squad with which the Cardinal
would become very familiar. The
Cowboys easily outpaced the field,
finishing with a cumulative 36-under
score en route to a 16-stroke win
over the Card. Amazingly, OSU put
four in front of Rodgers and Wilson,
who turned-in T-Bth, 7-under per
formances to wrap up their fall
slates. Once again, Boote showed
signs that perhaps he could be a rock
in the third position for Stanford
with his 5-under, T-13th finish.
I think we were all happy with the
fall," Ray said in early December. "I
think that at this point in the year,
we're in the position where we're
working on things landmines,
roadblocks, whatever you might say
that are in our way of being at our
best in the spring. That's what our
fall schedule provided us: a great
data sample and getting a bunch of
guys experience. Eight out of our 10
players on the team saw some action
in tournament play. We played some
very good competition on some diffi
cult golf courses and in different con
ditions than we might see every day
at Stanford, so there's a ton of posi
tives after our fall campaign."
The team translated those posi
tives into spring success, taking
team medalist honors in five of its
seven tournaments leading up to the
NCAA championships. From the
middle of February to the middle of
May, the Card were nearly unstop
pable. It was a memorable stretch of
play that is not likely to be surpassed
by another Stanford squad for some
time.
The run began at The Prestige at
PGA West in the California desert,
where the picturesque course de
signed by legend Greg Norman was
said to be "challenging but fair." But
Stanford took most of the challenge
out of the team race after the first
frame, which saw the Cardinal post a
15-under 269 score to give them an
insurmountable 11-shot lead. Even a
wild rally from Washington on the
event's final day could not supplant
the Cardinal from the top of the team
leaderboard. Rodgers notched his
seventh individual win on the
strength of his first round 65 to tie
Joel Kribel '99 for the second-most
individual wins in program history.
It was more of the same at the
Southern Highlands Collegiate
Masters for Rodgers, who just days
before the event had announced his
intention to make the jump to the
professional ranks after the spring
season concluded. The decision
seemed to lift a huge weight from his
shoulders as he went on to notch his
seventh NCAA win and second con
secutive win with rounds of 74-69-74
in Las Vegas. The Cardinal lost to
host UNLV by the same margin for
them only tournament loss from Feb.
17 through May 27.
"It was great, like a small weight
lifted off my shoulders," remarked
the well-spoken Rodgers after mak
ing his professional intentions
known. "And I think it's really

showed with the way I've played. I
was able to focus on playing my best
golf and helping my team win. I've
been really comfortable and at peace
with the decision."
Stanford kept its momentum
rolling at its only home event of the
season, easily outrunning the field at
The Goodwin on the Stanford Golf
Course. Ray's group defeated sec
ond-place USC and UCLA by twen
ty ticks, with Rodgers once again
taking individual medalist honors.
His 14-under 196 put the outgoing
junior six strokes clear of his nearest
opponents and gave him his third
straight event victory. It was a good
win for both Rodgers and his team
mates.
Cameron Wilson's turn was next,
as the Cardinal's senior leader used
clutch final round putting to take
gold at April's Western Intercolle
giate, spurring his team to its third
win in four starts. This strong ending
to its regular season that gave Stan
ford the confidence it so effortlessly
exuded going into the championship
portion of its schedule.
"This was a big win for me," Wil
son said at the time. "I've been in
contention a lot this year and haven't
played poorly but haven't played
well at the end of the final rounds. To
do that this week felt great."
Rodgers, Wilson, Ray and com
pany made history at the Pac-12
Championships a few weeks later,
winning the program's first confer
ence title since 1994 in the most dom
inating of fashions. Stanford led
from the start and placed all five of
its players in the individual top 20,
annihilating its Pac-12 foes: Wash
ington was second, 15 strokes off the
pace, with two-time defending con
ference champion Cal 29 shots back.
Predictably, Rodgers finished atop
the individual leaderboard, and was
now just one behind Tiger Woods'
program record.
The Card displayed the same
type of dominance at the Eugene Re
gional, breezing through the event
without ever surrendering the team
lead. It was an important step for the
Cardinal, finally bringing some clo
sure to their heart-wrenching sev
enth-place position at the 2013
Columbus Regional. Rodgers won
again, not that his victory came as
any surprise. But it was a significant
victory, as it tied him with Woods for
the program lead in victories.
While Rodgers aimed to break
the deadlock at the NCAA Champi
onships, it was his teammate Wilson
who finished on top at Prairie Dunes,
ending his collegiate career by win
ning Stanford's third individual na
tional championship by defeating
rival Ollie Schniederjans in a third
round playoff. Also of note was
Boote, who made an impressive run
up the leaderboard in the final
round, placing T-3rd in the particu
larly competitive field.
"I was a little nervous, but more
than anything I was really excited,"
Wilson told the media after the play
off. "I was really excited for the op
portunity, and I made it a point to
just enjoy the day and everything
that came with it.
"More than anything, I was just
really loving the chance to win and
loving being here with my guys,"
Wilson continued. "Once I knew
from coach that we were doing well
in the team portion, I really didn't
feel that much pressure to win."
But the sort of depth the Cardinal
exhibited in the stroke play portion
of N CAAs did not carry over into the
match play rounds, where they were
dispatched by Oklahoma State in the

semifinals, 3-2. It was a tough break
for a team that will have a tough time
reaching the N CAA finals next year,
in large part because of Wilson and
Rodgers' departures.
Ray will now turn to Boote and
rising sophomores Liu, McNealy
and Viraat Badhwar to carry the
load in the 2014-15 campaign. Re
turnees Patrick Grimes and Do
minick Francks will also have ample
opportunity to prove their worth, as
will the three freshmen the program
will welcome. Next year will be a
telling one for Stanford, as the squad
will try to show it was and is more
than just its two frontrunners.
But the bottom line is that the
consistently great production from
Rodgers and Wilson â€”l4 collegiate
wins between the two simply can
not be replaced. All in all, repeating
their historic 2014 spring season fig
ures to be an exceedingly tough task
for the Card not impossible, but
certainly challenging.

the time, the year when veteran
prowess would intersect with
youthful exuberance and create a
winning formula. And win it did.
Stanford notched the first of its
program-high six tournament vic
tories in October at the Erin Hills
Intercollegiate, dominating the 14-

team field en route to an eight-shot
win over UCLA. Rodgers collected
individual medalist honors in what
was then the sixth victory of his col
legiate career, prevailing by three
strokes in rounds of 68-72-69. Wil
son and sophomore David Boote
also flexed their muscles at the
Marquette-hosted event, finishing
T-6th at 2-under. Highly touted

freshman Jim Liu gave the Card a
fourth golfer in the top 10, coming
in at T-lOth despite beginning his
final round with a 10 on the par-5
first hole. Classmate Maverick Mc-
Nealy also squeezed into the top 25.
This was this type of depth the unit
would rely on for much of its season.
"Our guys did a nice job in then
preparation and practice gearing

up to the event, and I think that
served us well at the tournament,"
Ray said after the event. "It was
neat to see the team win and play
well with the lead [Tuesday], They
hit some smart shots, avoided trou
ble and double bogeys, which is
something we've been talking a lot

about and they've been working on."
After failing to maintain its mo
mentum at the U.S. Collegiate
Championships later in October,
Stanford ended the month and its
four-event fall schedule on a
stronger note at the Royal Oaks In
tercollegiate. Held at the Royal Oaks
Country Club in Dallas, Texas, the
tournament featured an Oklahoma
State squad with which the Cardinal
would become very familiar. The
Cowboys easily outpaced the field,
finishing with a cumulative 36-under
score en route to a 16-stroke win
over the Card. Amazingly, OSU put
four in front of Rodgers and Wilson,
who turned-in T-Bth, 7-under per
formances to wrap up their fall
slates. Once again, Boote showed
signs that perhaps he could be a rock
in the third position for Stanford
with his 5-under, T-13th finish.
I think we were all happy with the
fall," Ray said in early December. "I
think that at this point in the year,
we're in the position where we're
working on things landmines,
roadblocks, whatever you might say
that are in our way of being at our
best in the spring. That's what our
fall schedule provided us: a great
data sample and getting a bunch of
guys experience. Eight out of our 10
players on the team saw some action
in tournament play. We played some
very good competition on some diffi
cult golf courses and in different con
ditions than we might see every day
at Stanford, so there's a ton of posi
tives after our fall campaign."
The team translated those posi
tives into spring success, taking
team medalist honors in five of its
seven tournaments leading up to the
NCAA championships. From the
middle of February to the middle of
May, the Card were nearly unstop
pable. It was a memorable stretch of
play that is not likely to be surpassed
by another Stanford squad for some
time.
The run began at The Prestige at
PGA West in the California desert,
where the picturesque course de
signed by legend Greg Norman was
said to be "challenging but fair." But
Stanford took most of the challenge
out of the team race after the first
frame, which saw the Cardinal post a
15-under 269 score to give them an
insurmountable 11-shot lead. Even a
wild rally from Washington on the
event's final day could not supplant
the Cardinal from the top of the team
leaderboard. Rodgers notched his
seventh individual win on the
strength of his first round 65 to tie
Joel Kribel '99 for the second-most
individual wins in program history.
It was more of the same at the
Southern Highlands Collegiate
Masters for Rodgers, who just days
before the event had announced his
intention to make the jump to the
professional ranks after the spring
season concluded. The decision
seemed to lift a huge weight from his
shoulders as he went on to notch his
seventh NCAA win and second con
secutive win with rounds of 74-69-74
in Las Vegas. The Cardinal lost to
host UNLV by the same margin for
them only tournament loss from Feb.
17 through May 27.
"It was great, like a small weight
lifted off my shoulders," remarked
the well-spoken Rodgers after mak
ing his professional intentions
known. "And I think it's really

showed with the way I've played. I
was able to focus on playing my best
golf and helping my team win. I've
been really comfortable and at peace
with the decision."
Stanford kept its momentum
rolling at its only home event of the
season, easily outrunning the field at
The Goodwin on the Stanford Golf
Course. Ray's group defeated sec
ond-place USC and UCLA by twen
ty ticks, with Rodgers once again
taking individual medalist honors.
His 14-under 196 put the outgoing
junior six strokes clear of his nearest
opponents and gave him his third
straight event victory. It was a good
win for both Rodgers and his team
mates.
Cameron Wilson's turn was next,
as the Cardinal's senior leader used
clutch final round putting to take
gold at April's Western Intercolle
giate, spurring his team to its third
win in four starts. This strong ending
to its regular season that gave Stan
ford the confidence it so effortlessly
exuded going into the championship
portion of its schedule.
"This was a big win for me," Wil
son said at the time. "I've been in
contention a lot this year and haven't
played poorly but haven't played
well at the end of the final rounds. To
do that this week felt great."
Rodgers, Wilson, Ray and com
pany made history at the Pac-12
Championships a few weeks later,
winning the program's first confer
ence title since 1994 in the most dom
inating of fashions. Stanford led
from the start and placed all five of
its players in the individual top 20,
annihilating its Pac-12 foes: Wash
ington was second, 15 strokes off the
pace, with two-time defending con
ference champion Cal 29 shots back.
Predictably, Rodgers finished atop
the individual leaderboard, and was
now just one behind Tiger Woods'
program record.
The Card displayed the same
type of dominance at the Eugene Re
gional, breezing through the event
without ever surrendering the team
lead. It was an important step for the
Cardinal, finally bringing some clo
sure to their heart-wrenching sev
enth-place position at the 2013
Columbus Regional. Rodgers won
again, not that his victory came as
any surprise. But it was a significant
victory, as it tied him with Woods for
the program lead in victories.
While Rodgers aimed to break
the deadlock at the NCAA Champi
onships, it was his teammate Wilson
who finished on top at Prairie Dunes,
ending his collegiate career by win
ning Stanford's third individual na
tional championship by defeating
rival Ollie Schniederjans in a third
round playoff. Also of note was
Boote, who made an impressive run
up the leaderboard in the final
round, placing T-3rd in the particu
larly competitive field.
"I was a little nervous, but more
than anything I was really excited,"
Wilson told the media after the play
off. "I was really excited for the op
portunity, and I made it a point to
just enjoy the day and everything
that came with it.
"More than anything, I was just
really loving the chance to win and
loving being here with my guys,"
Wilson continued. "Once I knew
from coach that we were doing well
in the team portion, I really didn't
feel that much pressure to win."
But the sort of depth the Cardinal
exhibited in the stroke play portion
of N CAAs did not carry over into the
match play rounds, where they were
dispatched by Oklahoma State in the

semifinals, 3-2. It was a tough break
for a team that will have a tough time
reaching the N CAA finals next year,
in large part because of Wilson and
Rodgers' departures.
Ray will now turn to Boote and
rising sophomores Liu, McNealy
and Viraat Badhwar to carry the
load in the 2014-15 campaign. Re
turnees Patrick Grimes and Do
minick Francks will also have ample
opportunity to prove their worth, as
will the three freshmen the program
will welcome. Next year will be a
telling one for Stanford, as the squad
will try to show it was and is more
than just its two frontrunners.
But the bottom line is that the
consistently great production from
Rodgers and Wilson â€”l4 collegiate
wins between the two simply can
not be replaced. All in all, repeating
their historic 2014 spring season fig
ures to be an exceedingly tough task
for the Card not impossible, but
certainly challenging.

For the Stanford men's golf
team, the 2013-14 campaign
seemed like one of destiny. After
failing to advance to the NCAA fi
nals a season ago with a roster
loaded with experience and talent,
the Cardinal were undoubtedly on a
mission to reverse the program's
recent trend of underperformance
when the stakes were at their high
est.
By early March, everything
seemed to be coalescing: Senior
Cameron Wilson was establishing
himself as one of college golf's best,
junior Patrick Rodgers was ready
to go out on a high note after an
nouncing his intention to turn pro
fessional and the squad's depth was
filling out nicely. Head coach Con
rad Ray had it all in his squad of ex
ceptional frontrunners and strong
players to fill the 3-4 slots in good
form. It felt as though this would be
the time, the year when veteran
prowess would intersect with
youthful exuberance and create a
winning formula. And win it did.
