# UNDERCLASSMEN TAKE CHARGE

### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
Before the 2013-14 season
began, those who follow women's
collegiate golf and the Stanford
women's team would likely have
told you that the Card belonged to
sophomore star Mariah Stack
house. No one would have blamed

them, as Stackhouse had a very im
pressive freshman campaign that
included leading her squad to its
highest finish in the NCAAs in sev
eral years. Indeed, the WGCA and
Golf Week First Team All-American
appeared poised to consolidate her
position as one of the best female
amateurs in the nation.
And although Stackhouse had a

solid season in which she recorded
seven top-10 finishes in her first
seven starts, it was classmate Lau
ren Kim who took over as the
team's on-course leader down the
stretch. Kim's magnificent spring
culminated in a third place finish at
NCAAs after several brief mo
ments in the lead the best plac
ing at the NCAA finals for a Stan

ford player in over two decades.
Kim's opening and closing
events of 2013-14 came at the Tulsa
Country Club, with radically differ
ent outcomes. Kim and her Stan
ford teammates began their season
in early September at the Dale Mc-
Namara Fall Preview, where the
Cardinal finished ninth in the 15-
team field. While the Card would,
unfortunately, replicate that disap
pointing team placing at the NCAA
championships eight and a half
months later, Kim's individual per
formance could not have been more
different.
The Los Altos, California, prod
uct shot 8-over 218 in September,
posting a promising 2-under 68 in
the first round before going 10-over
for her last 36 holes to finish T-28th.
In May, she got off to the same sort
of start 3-under 67 for the first
18 but this time was able to
maintain her roll. Kim used middle
rounds of 71-72 to stay in contention
then fired another 67 to close the
event, ultimately finishing third.
What's more, she could've made
things very interesting had she not
bogeyed 14 and doubled-bogeyed
16 on her back nine. But, as she
communicated in Tulsa, she's con
tent to not live in the past.
"One of the things coach [Walk
er] and I always talk about and that
I have been working on is just stay
ing in the present more and not
thinking about the past too much,"
Kim said following her fourth
round. "That really helped and I
know that anything can happen. I

Sophomore Lauren Kim (above) quietly emerged as one of the Cardinal's strongest golfers during the
2013-14 season, becoming a strong complement to sophomore Mariah Stackhouse atop the rotation.
