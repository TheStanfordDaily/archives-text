# UNDERCLASSMEN TAKE CHARGE
## 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
Before the 2013-14 season
began, those who follow women's
collegiate golf and the Stanford
women's team would likely have
told you that the Card belonged to
sophomore star Mariah Stack
house. No one would have blamed

them, as Stackhouse had a very im
pressive freshman campaign that
included leading her squad to its
highest finish in the NCAAs in sev
eral years. Indeed, the WGCA and
Golf Week First Team All-American
appeared poised to consolidate her
position as one of the best female
amateurs in the nation.
And although Stackhouse had a

solid season in which she recorded
seven top-10 finishes in her first
seven starts, it was classmate Lau
ren Kim who took over as the
team's on-course leader down the
stretch. Kim's magnificent spring
culminated in a third place finish at
NCAAs after several brief mo
ments in the lead the best plac
ing at the NCAA finals for a Stan

ford player in over two decades.
Kim's opening and closing
events of 2013-14 came at the Tulsa
Country Club, with radically differ
ent outcomes. Kim and her Stan
ford teammates began their season
in early September at the Dale Mc-
Namara Fall Preview, where the
Cardinal finished ninth in the 15-
team field. While the Card would,
unfortunately, replicate that disap
pointing team placing at the NCAA
championships eight and a half
months later, Kim's individual per
formance could not have been more
different.
The Los Altos, California, prod
uct shot 8-over 218 in September,
posting a promising 2-under 68 in
the first round before going 10-over
for her last 36 holes to finish T-28th.
In May, she got off to the same sort
of start 3-under 67 for the first
18 but this time was able to
maintain her roll. Kim used middle
rounds of 71-72 to stay in contention
then fired another 67 to close the
event, ultimately finishing third.
What's more, she could've made
things very interesting had she not
bogeyed 14 and doubled-bogeyed
16 on her back nine. But, as she
communicated in Tulsa, she's con
tent to not live in the past.
"One of the things coach [Walk
er] and I always talk about and that
I have been working on is just stay
ing in the present more and not
thinking about the past too much,"
Kim said following her fourth
round. "That really helped and I
know that anything can happen. I

think being in the morning wave
helped too because it helped me put
things in perspective and realize
you really do not know what will
happen."
The Cardinal followed-up their
event in Tulsa with a T-3rd perform
ance at the Windy City Collegiate
Classic a few weeks later, where
Kim rebounded with a strong 1-
under 212 score. While she strug
gled in the first frame, Kim went 5-
under over her last 36 holes to se
cure the first of seven top-10 individ
ual finishes.
After dominating the Edean Ih
lanfeldt Invitational in a fashion that
head coach Anne Walker called the
most impressive of her tenure, the
group headed back to campus to
play the first of two home tourna
ments. The Stanford Intercollegiate
hosted an epic battle between two of
college golf's historically great
teams and rivalry, USC and UCLA,
with the defending national champi
on Trojans escaping with a narrow
victory. The Cardinal turned in a
combined score of 3-over 855 to
claim fourth behind their Pac-12
conference foes; Stackhouse
notched one of the best statistical
tournaments of her season, carding
a cumulative 4-under 209 to grab
her second consecutive top-5 finish.
Stanford wrapped-up its fall
slate in Hawaii at The Nanea Pac-12
Preview, but the trip to the Big Is
land was anything but relaxing for
Walker's squad. Finishing in the
middle of the pack was not the re
sult the Cardinal desired, and
proved they still had to make up sig
nificant ground if they were to com
pete for the conference title.
"Kind of confirmed what I was
thinking as we're moving into this
fall," Walker said in December of
her biggest takeaway from her
team's first five events. "We have
the talent; we have the players to be
the best team in the country. But we
also at the same time are a very
young team, so what comes with
that is some up and downs. And we
had some up and downs. We played
the University of Washington, and I
think we could've beaten any team
in the country that week. We
smoked them. But then there are
other weeks, like our final event at
Nanea in Hawaii we were a little
bit tired, a little bit younger. We fin
ished sixth wasn't our best."
The spring season saw a more
auspicious start for the Card, who
won their first two starts at the Peg
Barnard and UC-Irvine Invitation
als in February At the former, Stan
ford put three golfers in the top-5,
including freshman Casey Daniel
son at T-2nd. Danielson improved
her play markedly in the spring
events, leading or co-leading her
team in four of its eight tourna
ments. Stackhouse collected the
second individual medalist honors
of her season at UC-Irvine, going
70-69-73 to best Grace Na of Pep
perdine by two strokes.
An unremarkable March had
Walker's group place T-lOth and T

2nd at lower level events before
moving on to the PING/ASU Invi
tational in April, the premier tour
nament of its regular season. But
the unit struggled against the na
tion's best yet again, and their sev
enth place performance left the
Cardinal as just the fifth-best Pac
-12 team in the field. Danielson con
tinued to rise, however, and gave
the team hope that it had found a
consistent low-scorer behind Kim
and Stackhouse.
"The fall season was a bit of an
adjustment period for me, just be
cause I was getting used to college
and college golf," Danielson said at
the time. "I worked hard heading
into the spring season on many
parts of my game, and Coach Walk
er helped to move me in the right di
rection as I worked on my swing,
putting and chipping. This [spring]
season, my long irons were much
more accurate and my up-and
down percentage was much higher.
It was great to see my hard work
pay off."
Despite laboring against their
Pac-12 foes in several tournaments
leading up to the conference tour
nament, the Card got off to the ex
cellent start they needed and found
themselves in second following the
first round of play in the Pac-12
tournament. They remained in con
tention through 36, slipping to third
but still within striking distance
with one frame remaining.Though
hope seemed lost when none of its
players completed the front-nine
under par, the quintet stayed
steady over the latter half of the
round, eventually eking-out a one
shot victory over Arizona and USC,
taking the program's first confer
ence crown since 1999.
The subsequent NCAA regional
competition was all about survival,
and the Card overcame a poor seed
ing and unlucky site selection to
comfortably advance to the NCAA
finals. There, Walker hoped her
squad could improve on their T
-13th finish from the 2013 iteration
of the event and perhaps secure a
coveted top-10 position. But the
team never coalesced in Tulsa and
limped to 18th in the 24-school field.
And while Kim tried valiantly to put
her teammates on her back, the fact
that she and Stackhouse were the
only two Stanford players in the
top-90 highlighted the lack of pro
duction from the back-end of the
lineup.
Rebuilding that depth is one of
Walker's top priorities, and the in
coming recruiting class will more
than shore-up the gaps left by de
parting seniors Marissa Mai* and
Danielle Fraser. Highlighting the
Class of 2018 is Shannon Aubert
from France, the 51st ranked female
amateur in the world who has a
wealth of experience on the Ameri
can and European junior circuits.
An addition like Aubert is sure to
bolster the Cardinal's lineup, which
only loses one player from its NCAA
squad. With most of its roster re
turning, Stanford is sure to be in a
position once again to challenge for
the conference title and perhaps a
national championship.

thinking as we're moving into this
fall," Walker said in December of
her biggest takeaway from her
team's first five events. "We have
the talent; we have the players to be
the best team in the country. But we
also at the same time are a very
young team, so what comes with
that is some up and downs. And we
had some up and downs. We played
the University of Washington, and I
think we could've beaten any team
in the country that week. We
smoked them. But then there are
other weeks, like our final event at
Nanea in Hawaii we were a little
bit tired, a little bit younger. We fin
ished sixth wasn't our best."
The spring season saw a more
auspicious start for the Card, who
won their first two starts at the Peg
Barnard and UC-Irvine Invitation
als in February At the former, Stan
ford put three golfers in the top-5,
including freshman Casey Daniel
son at T-2nd. Danielson improved
her play markedly in the spring
events, leading or co-leading her
team in four of its eight tourna
ments. Stackhouse collected the
second individual medalist honors
of her season at UC-Irvine, going
70-69-73 to best Grace Na of Pep
perdine by two strokes.
An unremarkable March had
Walker's group place T-lOth and T

2nd at lower level events before
moving on to the PING/ASU Invi
tational in April, the premier tour
nament of its regular season. But
the unit struggled against the na
tion's best yet again, and their sev
enth place performance left the
Cardinal as just the fifth-best Pac
-12 team in the field. Danielson con
tinued to rise, however, and gave
the team hope that it had found a
consistent low-scorer behind Kim
and Stackhouse.
"The fall season was a bit of an
adjustment period for me, just be
cause I was getting used to college
and college golf," Danielson said at
the time. "I worked hard heading
into the spring season on many
parts of my game, and Coach Walk
er helped to move me in the right di
rection as I worked on my swing,
putting and chipping. This [spring]
season, my long irons were much
more accurate and my up-and
down percentage was much higher.
It was great to see my hard work
pay off."
Despite laboring against their
Pac-12 foes in several tournaments
leading up to the conference tour
nament, the Card got off to the ex
cellent start they needed and found
themselves in second following the
first round of play in the Pac-12
tournament. They remained in con
tention through 36, slipping to third
but still within striking distance
with one frame remaining.Though
hope seemed lost when none of its
players completed the front-nine
under par, the quintet stayed
steady over the latter half of the
round, eventually eking-out a one
shot victory over Arizona and USC,
taking the program's first confer
ence crown since 1999.
The subsequent NCAA regional
competition was all about survival,
and the Card overcame a poor seed
ing and unlucky site selection to
comfortably advance to the NCAA
finals. There, Walker hoped her
squad could improve on their T
-13th finish from the 2013 iteration
of the event and perhaps secure a
coveted top-10 position. But the
team never coalesced in Tulsa and
limped to 18th in the 24-school field.
And while Kim tried valiantly to put
her teammates on her back, the fact
that she and Stackhouse were the
only two Stanford players in the
top-90 highlighted the lack of pro
duction from the back-end of the
lineup.
Rebuilding that depth is one of
Walker's top priorities, and the in
coming recruiting class will more
than shore-up the gaps left by de
parting seniors Marissa Mai* and
Danielle Fraser. Highlighting the
Class of 2018 is Shannon Aubert
from France, the 51st ranked female
amateur in the world who has a
wealth of experience on the Ameri
can and European junior circuits.
An addition like Aubert is sure to
bolster the Cardinal's lineup, which
only loses one player from its NCAA
squad. With most of its roster re
turning, Stanford is sure to be in a
position once again to challenge for
the conference title and perhaps a
national championship.

Before the 2013-14 season
began, those who follow women's
collegiate golf and the Stanford
women's team would likely have
told you that the Card belonged to
sophomore star Mariah Stack
house. No one would have blamed

them, as Stackhouse had a very im
pressive freshman campaign that
included leading her squad to its
highest finish in the NCAAs in sev
eral years. Indeed, the WGCA and
Golf Week First Team All-American
appeared poised to consolidate her
position as one of the best female
amateurs in the nation.
And although Stackhouse had a

solid season in which she recorded
seven top-10 finishes in her first
seven starts, it was classmate Lau
ren Kim who took over as the
team's on-course leader down the
stretch. Kim's magnificent spring
culminated in a third place finish at
NCAAs after several brief mo
ments in the lead the best plac
ing at the NCAA finals for a Stan

ford player in over two decades.
Kim's opening and closing
events of 2013-14 came at the Tulsa
Country Club, with radically differ
ent outcomes. Kim and her Stan
ford teammates began their season
in early September at the Dale Mc-
Namara Fall Preview, where the
Cardinal finished ninth in the 15-
team field. While the Card would,
unfortunately, replicate that disap
pointing team placing at the NCAA
championships eight and a half
months later, Kim's individual per
formance could not have been more
different.
The Los Altos, California, prod
uct shot 8-over 218 in September,
posting a promising 2-under 68 in
the first round before going 10-over
for her last 36 holes to finish T-28th.
In May, she got off to the same sort
of start 3-under 67 for the first
18 but this time was able to
maintain her roll. Kim used middle
rounds of 71-72 to stay in contention
then fired another 67 to close the
event, ultimately finishing third.
What's more, she could've made
things very interesting had she not
bogeyed 14 and doubled-bogeyed
16 on her back nine. But, as she
communicated in Tulsa, she's con
tent to not live in the past.
"One of the things coach [Walk
er] and I always talk about and that
I have been working on is just stay
ing in the present more and not
thinking about the past too much,"
Kim said following her fourth
round. "That really helped and I
know that anything can happen. I

think being in the morning wave
helped too because it helped me put
things in perspective and realize
you really do not know what will
happen."
The Cardinal followed-up their
event in Tulsa with a T-3rd perform
ance at the Windy City Collegiate
Classic a few weeks later, where
Kim rebounded with a strong 1-
under 212 score. While she strug
gled in the first frame, Kim went 5-
under over her last 36 holes to se
cure the first of seven top-10 individ
ual finishes.
After dominating the Edean Ih
lanfeldt Invitational in a fashion that
head coach Anne Walker called the
most impressive of her tenure, the
group headed back to campus to
play the first of two home tourna
ments. The Stanford Intercollegiate
hosted an epic battle between two of
college golf's historically great
teams and rivalry, USC and UCLA,
with the defending national champi
on Trojans escaping with a narrow
victory. The Cardinal turned in a
combined score of 3-over 855 to
claim fourth behind their Pac-12
conference foes; Stackhouse
notched one of the best statistical
tournaments of her season, carding
a cumulative 4-under 209 to grab
her second consecutive top-5 finish.
Stanford wrapped-up its fall
slate in Hawaii at The Nanea Pac-12
Preview, but the trip to the Big Is
land was anything but relaxing for
Walker's squad. Finishing in the
middle of the pack was not the re
sult the Cardinal desired, and
proved they still had to make up sig
nificant ground if they were to com
pete for the conference title.
"Kind of confirmed what I was

Before the 2013-14 season
began, those who follow women's
collegiate golf and the Stanford
women's team would likely have
told you that the Card belonged to
sophomore star Mariah Stack
house. No one would have blamed

them, as Stackhouse had a very im
pressive freshman campaign that
included leading her squad to its
highest finish in the NCAAs in sev
eral years. Indeed, the WGCA and
Golf Week First Team All-American
appeared poised to consolidate her
position as one of the best female
amateurs in the nation.
And although Stackhouse had a

solid season in which she recorded
seven top-10 finishes in her first
seven starts, it was classmate Lau
ren Kim who took over as the
team's on-course leader down the
stretch. Kim's magnificent spring
culminated in a third place finish at
NCAAs after several brief mo
ments in the lead the best plac
ing at the NCAA finals for a Stan

ford player in over two decades.
Kim's opening and closing
events of 2013-14 came at the Tulsa
Country Club, with radically differ
ent outcomes. Kim and her Stan
ford teammates began their season
in early September at the Dale Mc-
Namara Fall Preview, where the
Cardinal finished ninth in the 15-
team field. While the Card would,
unfortunately, replicate that disap
pointing team placing at the NCAA
championships eight and a half
months later, Kim's individual per
formance could not have been more
different.
The Los Altos, California, prod
uct shot 8-over 218 in September,
posting a promising 2-under 68 in
the first round before going 10-over
for her last 36 holes to finish T-28th.
In May, she got off to the same sort
of start 3-under 67 for the first
18 but this time was able to
maintain her roll. Kim used middle
rounds of 71-72 to stay in contention
then fired another 67 to close the
event, ultimately finishing third.
What's more, she could've made
things very interesting had she not
bogeyed 14 and doubled-bogeyed
16 on her back nine. But, as she
communicated in Tulsa, she's con
tent to not live in the past.
"One of the things coach [Walk
er] and I always talk about and that
I have been working on is just stay
ing in the present more and not
thinking about the past too much,"
Kim said following her fourth
round. "That really helped and I
know that anything can happen. I

Sophomore Lauren Kim (above) quietly emerged as one of the Cardinal's strongest golfers during the
2013-14 season, becoming a strong complement to sophomore Mariah Stackhouse atop the rotation.
think being in the morning wave
helped too because it helped me put
things in perspective and realize
you really do not know what will
happen."
The Cardinal followed-up their
event in Tulsa with a T-3rd perform
ance at the Windy City Collegiate
Classic a few weeks later, where
Kim rebounded with a strong 1-
under 212 score. While she strug
gled in the first frame, Kim went 5-
under over her last 36 holes to se
cure the first of seven top-10 individ
ual finishes.
After dominating the Edean Ih
lanfeldt Invitational in a fashion that
head coach Anne Walker called the
most impressive of her tenure, the
group headed back to campus to
play the first of two home tourna
ments. The Stanford Intercollegiate
hosted an epic battle between two of
college golf's historically great
teams and rivalry, USC and UCLA,
with the defending national champi
on Trojans escaping with a narrow
victory. The Cardinal turned in a
combined score of 3-over 855 to
claim fourth behind their Pac-12
conference foes; Stackhouse
notched one of the best statistical
tournaments of her season, carding
a cumulative 4-under 209 to grab
her second consecutive top-5 finish.
Stanford wrapped-up its fall
slate in Hawaii at The Nanea Pac-12
Preview, but the trip to the Big Is
land was anything but relaxing for
Walker's squad. Finishing in the
middle of the pack was not the re
sult the Cardinal desired, and
proved they still had to make up sig
nificant ground if they were to com
pete for the conference title.
"Kind of confirmed what I was
thinking as we're moving into this
fall," Walker said in December of
her biggest takeaway from her
team's first five events. "We have
the talent; we have the players to be
the best team in the country. But we
also at the same time are a very
young team, so what comes with
that is some up and downs. And we
had some up and downs. We played
the University of Washington, and I
think we could've beaten any team
in the country that week. We
smoked them. But then there are
other weeks, like our final event at
Nanea in Hawaii we were a little
bit tired, a little bit younger. We fin
ished sixth wasn't our best."
The spring season saw a more
auspicious start for the Card, who
won their first two starts at the Peg
Barnard and UC-Irvine Invitation
als in February At the former, Stan
ford put three golfers in the top-5,
including freshman Casey Daniel
son at T-2nd. Danielson improved
her play markedly in the spring
events, leading or co-leading her
team in four of its eight tourna
ments. Stackhouse collected the
second individual medalist honors
of her season at UC-Irvine, going
70-69-73 to best Grace Na of Pep
perdine by two strokes.
An unremarkable March had
Walker's group place T-lOth and T

2nd at lower level events before
moving on to the PING/ASU Invi
tational in April, the premier tour
nament of its regular season. But
the unit struggled against the na
tion's best yet again, and their sev
enth place performance left the
Cardinal as just the fifth-best Pac
-12 team in the field. Danielson con
tinued to rise, however, and gave
the team hope that it had found a
consistent low-scorer behind Kim
and Stackhouse.
"The fall season was a bit of an
adjustment period for me, just be
cause I was getting used to college
and college golf," Danielson said at
the time. "I worked hard heading
into the spring season on many
parts of my game, and Coach Walk
er helped to move me in the right di
rection as I worked on my swing,
putting and chipping. This [spring]
season, my long irons were much
more accurate and my up-and
down percentage was much higher.
It was great to see my hard work
pay off."
Despite laboring against their
Pac-12 foes in several tournaments
leading up to the conference tour
nament, the Card got off to the ex
cellent start they needed and found
themselves in second following the
first round of play in the Pac-12
tournament. They remained in con
tention through 36, slipping to third
but still within striking distance
with one frame remaining.Though
hope seemed lost when none of its
players completed the front-nine
under par, the quintet stayed
steady over the latter half of the
round, eventually eking-out a one
shot victory over Arizona and USC,
taking the program's first confer
ence crown since 1999.
The subsequent NCAA regional
competition was all about survival,
and the Card overcame a poor seed
ing and unlucky site selection to
comfortably advance to the NCAA
finals. There, Walker hoped her
squad could improve on their T
-13th finish from the 2013 iteration
of the event and perhaps secure a
coveted top-10 position. But the
team never coalesced in Tulsa and
limped to 18th in the 24-school field.
And while Kim tried valiantly to put
her teammates on her back, the fact
that she and Stackhouse were the
only two Stanford players in the
top-90 highlighted the lack of pro
duction from the back-end of the
lineup.
Rebuilding that depth is one of
Walker's top priorities, and the in
coming recruiting class will more
than shore-up the gaps left by de
parting seniors Marissa Mai* and
Danielle Fraser. Highlighting the
Class of 2018 is Shannon Aubert
from France, the 51st ranked female
amateur in the world who has a
wealth of experience on the Ameri
can and European junior circuits.
An addition like Aubert is sure to
bolster the Cardinal's lineup, which
only loses one player from its NCAA
squad. With most of its roster re
turning, Stanford is sure to be in a
position once again to challenge for
the conference title and perhaps a
national championship.
