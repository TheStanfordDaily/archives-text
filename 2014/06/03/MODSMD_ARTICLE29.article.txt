## FILM William Eubank INTERVIEW 
### ALICIA HAMAR 
Director William Eubank's
second film, "The Signal," is
an upcoming sci-fi inspired
film that revolves around
three-college students
Nick (Brenton Thwaites),
Hailey (Olivia Cooke) and Jonah
(Beau Knapp) who find them
selves lured into the desert by a
hacker they have been tracking
while on a cross-country road trip.
The Daily sat down with William Eu
bank for an exclusive discussion of
the film.
The Stanofrd Daily (TSD) : How did
you get the inspiration to make this
film? How did this all come together?
William Eubank (WE): I was fin
ishing my last film, and I have a close
friend, David Frigerio, who was kind
of getting at my ear a lot going,
"What's your next film? What's your
next film?" We like a lot of the same
movies and things and we started
talking about this big, sort of twisted
and crazy, idea that we wanted to kind
of arrive at somehow. The movie kind
of came about backwards because we
knew where we were going to go and
what we wanted to do with the end of
the film. Then we started to sort of re
engineer from there. Before we
knew it we were writing it, and we
pulled my little brother on board: he's
a terrific writer, as well. Because
there were so many crazy ideas, it
was the type of thing where we were

sort of exploring them togeth
er, about how to unravel them
and how to take these kids on
this crazy road trip.
TSD: What came first: the
idea for the plot of the idea for
the characters?
WE: The truth of the matter
is that I always kind of have a
crazy bunch of plot ideas in
my head, and I have a crazy
bunch of characters in my
head. We kind of put two to
gether in this particular situa
tion, where the first idea was
definitely the plot, this big
sort 0f... idea that I don't
want to give away because of
spoilers, but that was first.
The very end was first and
then we populated it with two
characters that were in my
mind already and then we
gave them a friend.
TSD: Do you identify with
Nick more?
WE: Yeah, I'm definitely
more of a Nick type of person.
I'm always trying to put up
emotional walls ... I always
find if I'm getting too emo
tionally involved in something
or somebody, I'm like, "Oh no,
I feel, like, slow, I feel, like,
weak," you know? And it can
be very awesome, but it's also
really scary at the same time,
and that's what Nick is going
through.

TSD: One of the things that
was interesting was Hailey's
role and looking at the role of
women in the film. Hailey was
"it" for Nick and you need
Hailey to tell Nick's story. But
what was her power? She
seemed spacey and out of it so
I saw her not as dynamic, but
kind of flat. But maybe
there's a point to it?
WE: Well it really is Nick's
story; it's definitely not Hai
ley's story. Somebody asked
me that question and was
like, "why was she in the
film?" And, well, my question
is, how can you tell his story
without having her in the
film? What am I supposed to
do? Put a wig on a piece of
board or something and be
like "he loves this board," you
know? We all have things that
we love or people that we
love, and I think that a lot of
people are eager for me to say
that Hailey is a device, but
she's not a device. She's
everything; she's the whole

point at the end of the day.
What is your emotional self, if
you have nothing to be emo
tional about? And a lot of peo
ple ... I know it, I can feel
them going "she's just a de
vice, why is she in the film?"
I'm like you guys are nuts.
Do you love your grandmoth
er? Do you love your mother?
Do you love your baby broth
er? Like, are they a device for
that love? No, they are that
love. You know what I mean?
And that's so important, that
she [Hailey] is telling us...
She's the whole point of him
trying to do everything that
he's doing in the film.
It would be difficult for me
to truthfully voice from the
perspective of a female just
cause I don't know the same
feelings. It's easy for me to
write Nick and to know kind
of how I'm scared of emotion
ally connecting with people.
It's easy for me to write that,
beccause I've been there. And
I've been that guy, and I've
had those feelings for some
body and have been scared of
losing them or been scared of
them pushing me away some
how. It's difficult to envision
writing that from a female's
perspective 'cause I don't
know it. I'm always analyzing
it [laughs], but I don't know it.
It's fair to say that she's
not even remotely, in this
movie, as rounded as Nick,
but she is the point, but she's
not extremely active.

TSD: Do you have a lot of sci
fi/horror thoughts going on in
your head when you're mak
ing movies?
WE: This was just some
thing. My next movie is very
different, I have a sort of "loss
of innocence" story that I'm
doing that's sort of modern
warfare tale about, sort of,
how war is conducted now,
and just because we're, like,
so far away and disconnected
from war doesn't mean that
it's any better. It's like, you
can't put lipstick on a pig and
say that the pig is now pretti
er, you know? That's a VERY
different type of tale. And
then I'm doing a sort of Scot
tish Highlander story. It's
sort of 1% fantasy, very sort
of "Miyazaki," that is about
fatherhood and about want
ing to pass on better parts of
yourself to your children, but
not wanting the worst parts
of you to be in them. And how
do you do that? It's sort of a
strange story.

TSD: How has your first ex
perience [directing "Love"]

helped you with this experi
ence?
WE: My first experience
taught me the crazy impor
tance of thinking outside the
box and how being forced into
rethinking how to do some
thing can sometimes lead to
the more creative choice.
When you're making low
budget stuff, you often want
to do something, but you
don't have the money to do it
so you have to figure out a dif
ferent way to execute that. I
had to do that throughout my
first film, like every shot al
most.
For example, there was a
shot where I didn't have a
way to get him [main charac
ter] outside of space, like I
didn't have a door for him to
leave when he was leaving the
space station, and I came up
with the idea to shoot a TV re
flecting into his mask. So I'm
shooting his mask but there's
a TV of space. I put a trash
can lid in front of it, and I roll
the trashcan lid away, and
then I used keyboard clean
ers upside down so they
sprayed spray everywhere.
And in the end, that choice
said the same thing. He was
opening a door to go to space,
but it was ten times more
powerful because I'm watch
ing it in his eyes. You can see
how he feels about it. So the
moment is being reflected in
him, who he is.
And I would have never
have done that. If I had the
money, I probably would have
him open a door and go out.
But this was way more pow
erful, so in a weird way being
forced into this creative solu
tion ended up being a much
more strong moment in the
film that I wouldn't have ever
seen unless I'd been forced to

dig deep and find the best
way to shoot it. "Love" taught
me the importance of that.
When you are forced to come
up with a different solution,
sometimes that solution is ten
times better than just throw
ing money at something.

TSD: What was it like work
ing with Brenton, Olivia and
Laurence Fishburne on set?
WE: It was amazing, all of
them are amazing! Lawrence
Fishburne is out of control.
He's the greatest guy in the
world, he was wearing this
suit and it's like 100 degrees
and he's never complaining.
He turns the smallest things
into such gravity and such
power. He just has a pres
ence, and that's what we
needed. I don't know what I
would have done without him;
you know what I mean, be
cause you need that presence
from him as a character. To
get him was like a dream.
It was cool working with
the kids because they're so
eager and are really those
people, and they are really
just good human beings.
They would shoot on the
weekends with me. I feel like
they're all coming up right
now: Brenton's got "The
Giver" and he's coming out
with "Maleficent." I feel like
they're all blowing up be
cause they are such good peo
ple. It's so cool; it just means
the right people are doing the
right stuff. And as a young
filmmaker, only my second
film, to get such talented kids
to work with, like Beau, Olivia
and Brenton, makes me feel
like I'm on the right track, or
I'm chasing the right thing.
