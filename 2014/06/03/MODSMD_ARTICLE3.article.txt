## Spiegel frat emails elicit response 
### JOSEPH BEYDA EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
In emails to members of the Stanford community late
last week, Provost John Etchemendy 'B2 and Kappa
Sigma resident assistant Hunter Kodama 'l4 condemned
the messages sent by Snapchat co-founder and CEO
Evan Spiegel 'l2 while he was a member of the fraterni
ty at Stanford.
"The sentiments expressed in these emails do not re
flect what we, as members of the Stanford community,
expect of one another," Etchemendy wrote. "We can

choose to turn a blind eye to such statements and chalk
them up to youthful indiscretion. Or we can be more
courageous, and affirmatively reject such behavior
whenever and wherever we see it, even no, especial
ly if it comes from a friend, a classmate, or a col
league. Only if we choose the latter will we create the
kind of university culture we all can be proud of, all of the
time."
