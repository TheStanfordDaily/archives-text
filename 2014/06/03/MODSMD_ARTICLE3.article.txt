## Spiegel frat emails elicit response 
### JOSEPH BEYDA EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
In emails to members of the Stanford community late
last week, Provost John Etchemendy 'B2 and Kappa
Sigma resident assistant Hunter Kodama 'l4 condemned
the messages sent by Snapchat co-founder and CEO
Evan Spiegel 'l2 while he was a member of the fraterni
ty at Stanford.
"The sentiments expressed in these emails do not re
flect what we, as members of the Stanford community,
expect of one another," Etchemendy wrote. "We can

choose to turn a blind eye to such statements and chalk
them up to youthful indiscretion. Or we can be more
courageous, and affirmatively reject such behavior
whenever and wherever we see it, even no, especial
ly if it comes from a friend, a classmate, or a col
league. Only if we choose the latter will we create the
kind of university culture we all can be proud of, all of the
time."
Spiegel's emails from 2009 and 2010, released last
Wednesday by Gawker's Valleywag blog, demeaned
members of campus sororities and,
in one instance, former Dean of
Freshmen Julie Lytheott-Haims
'B9. The messages described get
ting women drunk and performing
sexual acts.
Spiegel has since apologized for
the messages in a statement from
Snapchat, saying that he has "no
excuse" for the emails.
"They in no way reflect who I
am today or my views towards
women," the statement read.
Kappa Sigma lost its on-campus

house for the 2011-12 academic
year, stemming from a 2010 party
suspension and an alcohol culture
that Dean of Residential Education
Deborah Golder called "danger
ous" at the time. The fraternity was
allowed to move back in for the 2012
fall quarter.
"The more concerning things in
those emails ... are representa
tive of a culture that we as an or
ganization have left behind us,"
Kodoma wrote to campus sorori
ties on Thursday. "That very cul
ture was one of the biggest fac
tors in the University's decision
to revoke our house three years
ago, and the reversal of that cul
ture is one of the reasons we were
fortunate enough to have it rein

stated a year later. But infinitely
more important to everyone in our
house than a ruling by the Univer
sity, we hope that you've all per
sonally observed a positive culture
in our house and in your interac
tions with our members."
Though Etchemendy wrote on
Friday that the Stanford community
is ashamed of Spiegel's emails, he
also said that students should see the
incident as a learning experience.
"Members of our community
should learn now, not many years
from now, how abhorrent those at
titudes are, whether real or
feigned," Etchemendy said.
