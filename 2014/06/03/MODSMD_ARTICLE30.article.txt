# BOOKS Top 5 reads of summer
## 
### CALEB SMITH STAFF WRITER 
Nothing says summer like the
opportunity to lie in the sun
and read a book of your own
choosing. Before you ran
sack your local library trying
to find good reading materi
al, here are five great summer
books to read.
1. "Cloud Atlas" by David Mitchell
A dizzying trip through six dif
ferent stories in different times,
"Cloud Atlas" is funny, sad and
thought-provoking. Structured like
a Russian folding doll, this book is
initially disconcerting, but it is awe
inspiring when the author shows
how all the stories are interconnect
ed. Reading this book rewards de
termination and an eye for detail.
Still confused at the end? See the
solid movie adaptation. Only see the
movie after you have read the book.
2. "A World Lit Only By Fire"
by William Manchester
Who said history couldn't be a
blast? Manchester's masterpiece is
some of the most entertainingly
written history you'll encounter all
year. In his writings about
the end of the Middle Ages
and the beginning of the ren
aissance and reformation,
Manchester rivals "Games of
Thrones" for scandal and ac
tion. Although the book's his
torical accuracy is sometimes
disputed, it is still a fascinat
ing introduction to an age.
3. "How Few Remain"
by Harry Turtledove
What if the South won the
Civil War? Although many
books have been written on
the subject, "How Few Re
main" is one of the most im
pressive. Set during a fiction
al 1880s rematch between an
independent Confederacy
and United States, this book
is entertaining because of its
lively wit and thought-pro
voking meditations on how
history could have turned
out. The true genius of the
book is that it follows specific
historical characters (Samuel
Clemens, Fredrick Douglass,

Stonewall Jackson, Theodore
Roosevelt, George Custer,
etc.) as they navigate this al
ternate reality.
4. "Catch-22"
by Joseph Heller
"Catch-22" is one of the
few classics that fully de
serves that label. A darkly
humorous story about Amer
ican bomber pilots during
World War Two, this book
features superb characters
and wild escapades. Besides
being extremely entertain
ing, it gives readers plenty of
material to think about and
contemplate. It's also perfect
for summer reading because
it is a classic that you can ac
tually read in paperback edi
tion.
5. "Raise the Titanic"
by Clive Cussler
Every summer reading
list needs an intensely enter
taining yet utterly brainless
thriller, right? "Raise the Ti
tanic" does a great job fulfill
ing both requirements. An
addictive thriller about inter
national conspiracies and un
derwater archeology (who
knew they went together so
well?), this rather far
fetched book still delivers a
fun time and more action
than Stanford's offense in
the last Big Game (or an
awful lot, put otherwise). As
its name suggests, the pro
tagonist needs to raise the
"Titanic." Russian agents in
the way? Bummer.
