# BFD 2014
## Fan favorites and breakout artists come to Mountain View 
### GABRIELA GROTH 
BFD 2014, the annual Live 105 music festi
val in Mountain View, started off the sum
mer on a light note, showcasing a selec
tion of bands on the festival circuit this
year. The highlights included a perfect
performance by Foster the People for a
beautiful California summer night.
BFD always brings some great bands to the
Bay Area and this year was no exception. New
York-based duo MS MR gave a near-perfect
performance, as always. It can be fun when a
band jazzes up its songs for a live performance,
but sometimes fans just want to hear the songs
they know and love, as they were recorded.
Lizzy Plapinger hit all the right notes with her
vocals right on point and a stage presence that
seemed to radiate with excitement.
Another quartet, Kongos, had the most sur
prising breakout performance, full of genuine
passion and energy. Their somewhat aggressive,
thumping, folk-inspired recordings translated
beautifully to live performance and got the
crowd stomping along with barefoot lead vocal
ist, Dylan Kongos. Their distinctive sound is a
hypnotic blend of influences as disparate as Joni
Mitchell, Burundian drummers and Qawwali
musician Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan from Pakistan.
The sound alternates, hypnotically, between ag
gressive, thumping drumbeats and high, soaring
vocals.
M.l.A.'s performance felt misplaced among
the other bands at the festival, and she doesn't
even have a recent release that would make her
relevant to this year's festival. While on the radio
and in videos M.I.A. has a rebellious, fun quality,
her music didn't translate well this time around.
The stage set was minimal, with a psychedelic
video on the back monitor. Three other dancers
who seemed more like a pump-up dance crew
at a Bar Mitzvah than professional dancers with
a real purpose on stage—joined M.I.A. Music
that energizes on the radio can come across live
as an offensive cacophony of bass on bass on
bass, though to be fair, this may have been in part

due to the poor sound system quality.
Fitz and the Tantrums were as soulful and
dance inducing live as one would expect with a
perfect retro brand of indie pop. Lead singer
Michael Fitzpatrick never failed to keep the en
ergy up, even incorporating the audience with
some group dance moves.
The stripped down, minimalist stage set ups
for most of the bands were made up for in spades
when headliners Foster the People took the
stage to an opulent, beautiful light show, includ
ing large light-up crystal structures. Lead Vo
calist Mark Foster's presence on stage was like
that of a conductor directing the perfect execu
tion of his vision. He didn't talk too much during
the performance, but the careful few words he
did speak gave the impression that although

many of Foster the People's songs have a joyful
feel to them, the lyrics are thoughtful and, at
times, take on serious subjects.
Foster cautioned the crowd that our genera
tion's challenge might be isolation imposed by
the very technologies meant to bring us closer
together. He left the crowd with the poetic
words, "isolation is our enemy and apathy is its
friend." Being at a Foster the People show al
ways makes you wonder how many people in the
crowd process the lyrics to which they so readi
ly sing along. Whether about drug addiction or a
school shooter ("Pumped Up Kicks"), lyrics can
stand in stark contrast to the reactions of fans.
