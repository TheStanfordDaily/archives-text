## Maleficent chills audience 
### MEI-HSIN CHENG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As characters like Walter White and the
Underwoods dominate television, it's no
surprise that Disney has its first movie
centered around an anti-hero, "Malefi
cent." Angelina Jolie plays the titular
"Maleficent," and the film tells the "un
told" story of her past as an innocent, altruistic
fairy of the moors all the way to her role in the
Sleeping Beauty story.
Maleficent has always been one of the most

terrifying Disney villains.
Eerily green and guilty of
luring Princess Aurora to
prick her finger on the spin
ning wheel, this Disney devil
is equaled only by the Evil
Queen from "Snow White."
I doubt Angelina Jolie's
Maleficent will be as memo
rable as the original, but I do
applaud the movie as a whole
for taking the Sleeping Beau
ty story in an unexpected di
rection. The real staying
power of this movie is its core
message. For years, Disney
has been telling stories about
true love, focusing on the ro
mantic kind of love, but re

cently, the focus has expand
ed to other types of love. The
moments that really count in
"Maleficent" are genuinely
heartfelt.
Cinematographically, this
is far from a perfect movie.
The storytelling and the pac
ing are uneven. It explores
hackneyed ideas such greedy,
power-hungry humans fight
ing the nature-loving fairies
and borrows heavily from
other films. The "moors" that
the fairies live in look like a
strange mix of "Avatar" and
"The Lord of the Rings."
Though the movie fea
tures a talented cast that in
cludes Elle Fanning as Auro
ra, Sharlto Copley as Stefan,
and Sam Riley as Diaval,
most of the characters are
one-dimensional and not
given much to do. Jolie does

most of the heavy lifting as
Maleficent is the only fully
developed character in the
movie. There are brief
glimpses at an amusing dy
namic between Maleficent
and her servant, Diaval, but
not enough of them to count
for much. The "good fairies"
(Lesley Manville, Imelda
Stauton, and Juno Temple)
who take care of Aurora are
meant to be comic relief, but
they are honestly so shrill and
callow, I cringed every time
they came on screen.
Overall, "Maleficent" is cer
tainly an interesting new ad
dition to the Disney mytholo
gy. Despite its flaws, it's
worth seeing the movie just
for its core message.
