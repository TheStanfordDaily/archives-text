# CS department fights plagiarism
## Faculty cites high enrollments, detection tools for rise in cases 
### KYLIE JUE DESK EDITOR 
It's 11 p.m. Your program is
crashing, and the assignment is
due at midnight. You know where
your error is, but you don't know
how to fix it. A simple Google
search pulls up tons of working
code, but copying that directly
into your program would be vio
lating the Honor Code.
Yet it seems like there are al
ways some students who give in to
the temptation.
Stanford's Office of Communi
ty Standards' annual case reports
demonstrate a steady increase in
the number of Honor Code viola
tions in computer science (CS)
each year.
However, the enrollment in
CS classes has also risen signifi
cantly over the last five years. In
the 2013-14 academic year, over
1,500 students took CS 106A:
Programming Methodology, the
first course of the introductory
programming series in the CS
department, and computer sci
ence has grown into the largest
major on campus.
"Enrollments are on the
rise," said Mehran Sahami '92
M.S. '93 Ph.D. '99, professor of
computer science and associate
chair of education for the CS de
partment. "If you imagine the
same percentage of Honor Code
violations is taking place but now
the enrollment in the class is
twice what it used to be, you're
going to see twice as many viola
tions."

Moss: a measure of software
similarity
Few students realize that each
assignment they submit is run
through a program called Meas
ure of Software Similarity (Moss).
Moss is used to detect similarities
between code submissions, and is
considered a standard across
most U.S. institutions. Used by
computer science departments
worldwide, Moss was developed
by Stanford computer science
professor Alex Aiken.
Developed 20 years ago dur
ing Aiken's time as a professor at
UC-Berkeley, Moss is designed to
cut down the manual labor of
searching for plagiarism. Howev
er, Aiken emphasized that Moss is
not a system for detecting plagia
rism directly.
"What Moss detects is similar
ity," Aiken said. "Why the code is
similar is a human judgment that
has to be made."
Since code might be similar for
various reasons, including shared
libraries or starter code provided
for the course, an instructor much
check to see whether or not the
similarity returned by Moss con
stitutes plagiarism. Moss simply
helps professors determine which
programs should be flagged with
a higher priority for further re
view.
"It's kind of smart about what
'the same' means. It knows, for
example, that if you go through
and change all the variable
names, it doesn't matter," Aiken
said. "It knows some things about
programming that allow it to make
some judgments about when two
things are really the same and when
they're not."
Aiken explained that Stanford
uses Moss to compare submissions
not only against other students'
work in the class, but also against
code available online and submis
sions from previous years and quar
ters. The program looks for aspects
such as similar structure, identical
bugs and other unusual commonali
ties.
According to Stanford computer
science lecturer Julie Zelenski 'B9
M.S. '96, Moss also accounts for al
gorithms used by a significant num
ber of students.
"It also knows how to recognize
when something is just so idiomatic
that everyone did it the same way,"
Zelenski said.
Zelenski also explained that
since the introductory classes are so
large, a graduate student has been
hired to build tools to manage the lo
gistics of finding high-priority
matches in Moss for 106A and 1068
before passing the data on to the
course instructor.
Computer science lecturer
Marty Stepp also spoke about the
importance of having a teaching as
sistant (TA) to examine the Moss re
sults first.
"He does all of that part for us,
basically gets [the MOSS results] all
ready for us to look over, produces a
nice executive summary for us of the
data and places it in front of us in an
easy way for us to examine," Stepp
said. "We look over the top matches
and decide which ones are concern
ing to us, and that works really well
because he can help us have a faster
turnaround."
Stepp also emphasized that the
student does not play a role in decid
ing whether or not a case should be
pursued.
"The instructor should make
that decision so it's important to
note that his role has nothing to do
with innocence," Stepp said. "[The
TA] doesn't make that call for us. We
wouldn't ever farm that out to a
third party."
Stepp also explained that al
though the section leading program
plays a large role in grading assign
ments for students in 106A and
1068, section leaders are not re
sponsible for looking for plagiarism.
Instead, they are told to contact the
instructor if misconduct is suspect-

Ed, and according to Stepp, most of
the time section leaders do not have
the experience to accurately recog
nize an Honor Code violation.

Dealing with violations
If a violation is discovered, stu
dents usually have two options:
choosing the Early Resolution Op
tion (ERO) or allowingthe case to go
to a hearing.
When a case is brought to the Of
fice of Community Standards, a stu
dent is assigned a judicial officer to
advocate for the student. If the case
moves to trial and eventually a hear
ing, a panel of five students and one
faculty member determines
whether or not the student's actions
constitute a violation of the Honor
Code. If a student is found guilty by
a five-to-one vote, the panel assigns
a sanction to the student.
According to Stanford's Office of
Community Standards, standard
first-time sanctions are usually a
quarter of suspension and 40 hours
of community service unless the
panel finds that another response is
more appropriate.
First instituted in 2009, the ERO
gives students the opportunity to
immediately accept responsibility
for their actions and skip the judicial
hearing process. Zelenski explained
that the ERO gives students an in
centive to take responsibility for
their actions rather than lying to
avoid a sanction. In addition, while
hearings can take two months or
longer, the ERO can be resolved
within a few weeks.
"The vast majority of the stu
dents who I'm sending [to OCS] are
choosing to pursue an ERO alterna
tive [rather] than go to a full hear
ing," Zelenski said.
Even before sending a student to
the OCS, different instructors han
dle potential honor code violations
differently, Sahami said.
"Depending on the results they
get back [from Moss], some [in
structors] will just report them im
mediately without talking to the stu
dent. Some prefer to talk to the stu
dent," Sahami said. "We try to be
consistent with respect to how we
handle the Honor Code it's just a
matter of time constraints and per
sonal preference."
Sahami himself asks to meet with
students and gives them the chance
to take responsibility in advance be
fore telling them about the Moss
match.
"We have a conversation of what
happened, and what I look at are
things like how contrite is the stu
dent," Sahami said. "Virtually every
time I've talked to a student they're
very straightforward about what
happened. In some cases, it some

times takes them a little while to re
alize that honesty is the best policy,
and they shouldn't make up some
story to get out of the situation."
Sahami also explained that while
he is required to report the case to
the OCS, he is on a student's side
once he or she admits to violating
the Honor Code.
"I think the issue of academic
honesty should also be one that's not
just punitive but is really about
learning," Sahami said. "I'm in favor
for leniency on the side of students
who take responsibility."
As a new instructor in the CS de
partment this year, Stepp explained
that he in fact has not yet dealt with
any Honor Code violations, al
though he has not finished looking
through assignments from this
quarter.
"I'm lucky enough to say that I
have not forwarded any cases so far
in my last two quarters here at Stan
ford," Stepp said.
"I think that there are always
programs that come up in our list
ings that I feel are suspicious," he

added. "But I feel I have to be very
confident in a match in order to
make an accusation, and I haven't
done so."
In terms of repercussions, an
Honor Code case does not show up
on a student's transcript, but a nota
tion is kept on administrative record
for reference in case of future viola
tions.
According to Zelenski, common
forms of punishment include a fail
ing grade in the course, community
service, suspension or probation.
For repeated or unusual cases, ex
pulsion is also a rare consequence.
Why it happens: instructor per
spectives
Despite Stepp's violation-free
stint on the Farm, Zelenski ex
plained that in her experience teach
ing CS 107: Computer Organization
and Systems, she usually encoun
ters one or two cases for each of the
seven assignments.
Zelenski spoke about some of the
main causes for Honor Code viola
tions in CS, including the stress ere

ated by midnight deadlines and code
that does not work. She explained
that even if a program is well writ
ten, a small bug can cause big prob
lems that feel like failure.
"When you have a program that
doesn't work, it's usually really obvi
ous and really hard to cope with,"
Zelenski said. "The arbiter of cor
rectness is obvious and apparent."
"Having our deadlines at mid
night probably doesn't help because
in some sense that's maybe when
you're most weak when you're
tired," she added.
Furthermore, copying and past
ing working code from an online
source makes cheating in CS espe
cially easy compared to in other sub
jects.
"It's ridiculously easy," Zelenski
said. "It can all happen in just the
space of a few minutes when [a stu
dent is] just starting to feel panicked
and desperate."
In general, the availability of
code on the web has become an in
evitable problem, especially since
that form of plagiarism does not re
quire the consent of two parties. Al
though Zelenski regularly searches
the web for online versions of as
signments, she explained that catch
ing every instance is difficult and
spoke about a case from this quarter
in which around 10 students in CS
107 used parts of code that had been
uploaded to the software hosting
site Git Hub.
"At the beginning of the quarter
and a couple times along the way I
just do the obvious searches on all
the places that code gets put," Ze
lenski said. "If I ever find it and it's
from a student of mine, I send them
a very nice note and say I really
want this down."
In February, Zelenski discov
ered that a former CS 107 student
had uploaded the Crashßeporter
assignment online. She requested
the code be taken down, and the stu
dent complied, but not before a non-
Stanford student forked the reposi
tory, copying it to a completely dif
ferent location. When she later dis
covered the second version of the
code, Zelenski assumed students
would not find it.
"You have to be looking for the
code in ways [in which you] will find
code so I [thought], no one's going to
find it," Zelenski said. "Well, it turns
out I would be wrong about that
that there were a number of stu
dents who found it and totally used
it."
When 10 Honor Code cases were
revealed by the Moss results, Zelen
ski tried to ask the non-Stanford
student to take down the program.


VICTOR XU/The Stanford Daily
After a lack of response, she eventu
ally worked with the student who
originally owned the code to use a
Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(DMCA) procedure to remove the
code from Git Hub.
Despite the hassle, Zelenski ex
plained that getting assignments off
the web was worth the time. She
used the incident as proof that, given
the opportunity, some students will
plagiarize.
"If you get the code off the web,
you just bring down the incident
rate," Zelenski said.
Stepp further emphasized the ef
fects of having code available online,
especially for introductory classes.
He explained that the problem is
compounded by the fact that assign
ments in CS classes are often kept
constant for several years, and new
ones are difficult to create.
"It takes more time to produce a
high-quality computer science
homework assignment than, say, a
math assignment," Stepp said. "On a
math assignment, you can produce
some new problems by changing
some of the numbers and some of
the variables and you have a new
equation to solve."
Stepp also discussed the fact that
students who took the class in the
past are more likely to share their
solutions than students currently
taking it.
"I think students who took a
class a long time ago are more cava
lier about handing out their solu
tion," Stepp said. "But if they just
wrote it and someone else didn't

write it and they want to take it, I
think the friend is less likely to
[share the code]."
Zelenski believes that another
source of Honor Code violations is
students' belief that they can beat
the system. With Moss mostly unad
vertised in Honor Code discussions
at the beginning of courses, many
students do not understand how
easy it is for instructors to catch pla
giarism.
"I do not think that the computer
science students at Stanford are
somehow more vulnerable, less
committed to integrity than our po
litical science students or [other ma
jors]," Zelenski said. "There's a cer
tain kind of confluence of motive and
opportunity and desperation, and I
think there's also the fact that we
can find it."
Stepp also emphasized that, de
spite stereotypes in the discipline,
collaboration is not the same as pla
giarism.
"We do want people to work to
gether and talk to each other we
just don't want them to share their
solutions with each other," Stepp
said. "There's a line. I think most
people know what that line is, and
it's unfortunate that some people
cross the line, but I think it's possi
ble to have a decent amount of col
laboration with other students with
out crossing that line."
Why it happens: student perspectives
Unsurprisingly, students told a
similar story about the effects of
stress in contributing to Honor
Code violations. Two students, Jeff
Taylor and Walter Smith both
names have been changed to pro
tect their identities spoke about
their experience with the ERO sys
tem in particular.

Taylor and Smith had been
working as a pair on a group CS
final project, but when Smith al
lowed a friend outside the team to
look at their code, they received an
unexpected email from their in
structor after assignments were
submitted.
Unknown to either student, the
friend had copied part of Taylor and
Smith's code and submitted it as his
own. The friend claimed that the
submission had been an accident,
and the case ended with an ERO.
Although neither Taylor nor Smith
were charged with an Honor Code
violation, Smith's friend reportedly
received a failing grade on the as
signment.
When asked about the case,
Smith and Taylor shared their
thoughts about why students might
choose to plagiarize.
"There are very few times in
which you break the Honor Code
for anything but grades. It's just
pressure," Smith said. "The dead
line is set at 12 a.m. and you've been
working on it for 10 hours, and you
just have one bug left, but you're
helpless and so you go to someone
for help just to get this one bug."
Taylor spoke about the fine line
between getting help from a friend
and cheating in writing code.
"There's a very fuzzy line from
getting help and cheating in CS,"
Taylor said. "If you need to find a
bug, instead of spending three
hours doing it, you can go to some
one and do it in five minutes. And if
you get in the habit of doing that,
you will basically have other people
writing your code. A lot of it is pres
sure or procrastination."
"In the case of CS specifically,
the getting help expedites the
process so much," he added. "And it

can snowball into cheating."
Smith observed that interna
tional students in particular feel
pressure to do well from family at
home.
"International students seem to
face this [pressure] a little bit more
than people from [the United
States]," Smith said. "There's more
pressure from back home to do well
in academics, to do really well. If
you get a B, it's unacceptable at any
level. While here, people realize
that it's Stanford and that getting a
B here is not that bad. But back
home no one knows what Stanford
is or the grading scheme."
Yet neither student felt that
cheating was ever justified, and
both believed that plagiarizing
without learning the material would
only hurt a student in the long run.
"The popular opinion is that it's
morally wrong to cheat because you
should learn the material for your
self," Taylor said. "In other coun
tries, cheating is an option."
Curbing cheating in the future
With the rising number of online
sources for code, instructors have
continued to investigate ways to dis
courage students from plagiarizing.
Stepp attributed his lack of Honor
Code cases to his slight alterations
to the assignments as a new lecturer.
Stepp has also added popups to
the class websites to caution stu
dents against plagiarism whenever
they download or submit an assign
ment. According to Stepp, research
has shown that reminders do in fact
affect the probability of a student's
choosing to cheat, especially if the
reminder comes before the student
starts an assignment.
"It's really hard to know what
factors have an impact and which

ones don't, but there has been edu
cational research that shows if you
remind students about these things
at key moments that it can make a
difference," Stepp said.
Jessie Duan 'l5, a student on the
Board of Judicial Affairs, spoke
about how the Board has been dis
cussing raising awareness about
Honor Code violations. One poten
tial effort includes talking to fresh
men about plagiarism.
"One thing we have been focus
ing on is raising awareness," Duan
said. "We've been talking about
reaching out to freshman dorms
more, making it more obvious from
the moment you get accepted into
Stanford [that] the Fundamental
Standard is this very important
thing."
Each computer science lecturer
and professor emphasized that the
department has gained a bad repu
tation for Honor Code violations
simply because it has the tools to
search for plagiarism.
"I think that it is true that com
puter science departments as a
whole tend to do more checking
than other departments," Aiken
said. "A lot of what you find depends
on whether you're looking."
Stepp also wanted to dispel the
misconception that students need to
work alone on CS assignments.
"There is a stereotype that we
don't want anyone to talk to anyone
and that computer science is isolated
and that you're not allowed to have
any contact with other people, and
you have to figure it out all by your
self with no help whatsoever," Stepp
said. "And I think that's a little bit un
fortunate because it's not true."

covered the second version of the
code, Zelenski assumed students
would not find it.
"You have to be looking for the
code in ways [in which you] will find
code so I [thought], no one's going to
find it," Zelenski said. "Well, it turns
out I would be wrong about that
that there were a number of stu
dents who found it and totally used
it."
When 10 Honor Code cases were
revealed by the Moss results, Zelen
ski tried to ask the non-Stanford
student to take down the program.


VICTOR XU/The Stanford Daily
After a lack of response, she eventu
ally worked with the student who
originally owned the code to use a
Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(DMCA) procedure to remove the
code from Git Hub.
Despite the hassle, Zelenski ex
plained that getting assignments off
the web was worth the time. She
used the incident as proof that, given
the opportunity, some students will
plagiarize.
"If you get the code off the web,
you just bring down the incident
rate," Zelenski said.
Stepp further emphasized the ef
fects of having code available online,
especially for introductory classes.
He explained that the problem is
compounded by the fact that assign
ments in CS classes are often kept
constant for several years, and new
ones are difficult to create.
"It takes more time to produce a
high-quality computer science
homework assignment than, say, a
math assignment," Stepp said. "On a
math assignment, you can produce
some new problems by changing
some of the numbers and some of
the variables and you have a new
equation to solve."
Stepp also discussed the fact that
students who took the class in the
past are more likely to share their
solutions than students currently
taking it.
"I think students who took a
class a long time ago are more cava
lier about handing out their solu
tion," Stepp said. "But if they just
wrote it and someone else didn't

write it and they want to take it, I
think the friend is less likely to
[share the code]."
Zelenski believes that another
source of Honor Code violations is
students' belief that they can beat
the system. With Moss mostly unad
vertised in Honor Code discussions
at the beginning of courses, many
students do not understand how
easy it is for instructors to catch pla
giarism.
"I do not think that the computer
science students at Stanford are
somehow more vulnerable, less
committed to integrity than our po
litical science students or [other ma
jors]," Zelenski said. "There's a cer
tain kind of confluence of motive and
opportunity and desperation, and I
think there's also the fact that we
can find it."
Stepp also emphasized that, de
spite stereotypes in the discipline,
collaboration is not the same as pla
giarism.
"We do want people to work to
gether and talk to each other we
just don't want them to share their
solutions with each other," Stepp
said. "There's a line. I think most
people know what that line is, and
it's unfortunate that some people
cross the line, but I think it's possi
ble to have a decent amount of col
laboration with other students with
out crossing that line."
Why it happens: student perspectives
Unsurprisingly, students told a
similar story about the effects of
stress in contributing to Honor
Code violations. Two students, Jeff
Taylor and Walter Smith both
names have been changed to pro
tect their identities spoke about
their experience with the ERO sys
tem in particular.

Taylor and Smith had been
working as a pair on a group CS
final project, but when Smith al
lowed a friend outside the team to
look at their code, they received an
unexpected email from their in
structor after assignments were
submitted.
Unknown to either student, the
friend had copied part of Taylor and
Smith's code and submitted it as his
own. The friend claimed that the
submission had been an accident,
and the case ended with an ERO.
Although neither Taylor nor Smith
were charged with an Honor Code
violation, Smith's friend reportedly
received a failing grade on the as
signment.
When asked about the case,
Smith and Taylor shared their
thoughts about why students might
choose to plagiarize.
"There are very few times in
which you break the Honor Code
for anything but grades. It's just
pressure," Smith said. "The dead
line is set at 12 a.m. and you've been
working on it for 10 hours, and you
just have one bug left, but you're
helpless and so you go to someone
for help just to get this one bug."
Taylor spoke about the fine line
between getting help from a friend
and cheating in writing code.
"There's a very fuzzy line from
getting help and cheating in CS,"
Taylor said. "If you need to find a
bug, instead of spending three
hours doing it, you can go to some
one and do it in five minutes. And if
you get in the habit of doing that,
you will basically have other people
writing your code. A lot of it is pres
sure or procrastination."
"In the case of CS specifically,
the getting help expedites the
process so much," he added. "And it

can snowball into cheating."
Smith observed that interna
tional students in particular feel
pressure to do well from family at
home.
"International students seem to
face this [pressure] a little bit more
than people from [the United
States]," Smith said. "There's more
pressure from back home to do well
in academics, to do really well. If
you get a B, it's unacceptable at any
level. While here, people realize
that it's Stanford and that getting a
B here is not that bad. But back
home no one knows what Stanford
is or the grading scheme."
Yet neither student felt that
cheating was ever justified, and
both believed that plagiarizing
without learning the material would
only hurt a student in the long run.
"The popular opinion is that it's
morally wrong to cheat because you
should learn the material for your
self," Taylor said. "In other coun
tries, cheating is an option."
Curbing cheating in the future
With the rising number of online
sources for code, instructors have
continued to investigate ways to dis
courage students from plagiarizing.
Stepp attributed his lack of Honor
Code cases to his slight alterations
to the assignments as a new lecturer.
Stepp has also added popups to
the class websites to caution stu
dents against plagiarism whenever
they download or submit an assign
ment. According to Stepp, research
has shown that reminders do in fact
affect the probability of a student's
choosing to cheat, especially if the
reminder comes before the student
starts an assignment.
"It's really hard to know what
factors have an impact and which

ones don't, but there has been edu
cational research that shows if you
remind students about these things
at key moments that it can make a
difference," Stepp said.
Jessie Duan 'l5, a student on the
Board of Judicial Affairs, spoke
about how the Board has been dis
cussing raising awareness about
Honor Code violations. One poten
tial effort includes talking to fresh
men about plagiarism.
"One thing we have been focus
ing on is raising awareness," Duan
said. "We've been talking about
reaching out to freshman dorms
more, making it more obvious from
the moment you get accepted into
Stanford [that] the Fundamental
Standard is this very important
thing."
Each computer science lecturer
and professor emphasized that the
department has gained a bad repu
tation for Honor Code violations
simply because it has the tools to
search for plagiarism.
"I think that it is true that com
puter science departments as a
whole tend to do more checking
than other departments," Aiken
said. "A lot of what you find depends
on whether you're looking."
Stepp also wanted to dispel the
misconception that students need to
work alone on CS assignments.
"There is a stereotype that we
don't want anyone to talk to anyone
and that computer science is isolated
and that you're not allowed to have
any contact with other people, and
you have to figure it out all by your
self with no help whatsoever," Stepp
said. "And I think that's a little bit un
fortunate because it's not true."

It's 11 p.m. Your program is
crashing, and the assignment is
due at midnight. You know where
your error is, but you don't know
how to fix it. A simple Google
search pulls up tons of working
code, but copying that directly
into your program would be vio
lating the Honor Code.
Yet it seems like there are al
ways some students who give in to
the temptation.
Stanford's Office of Communi
ty Standards' annual case reports
demonstrate a steady increase in
the number of Honor Code viola
tions in computer science (CS)
each year.
However, the enrollment in
CS classes has also risen signifi
cantly over the last five years. In
the 2013-14 academic year, over
1,500 students took CS 106A:
Programming Methodology, the
first course of the introductory
programming series in the CS
department, and computer sci
ence has grown into the largest
major on campus.
"Enrollments are on the
rise," said Mehran Sahami '92
M.S. '93 Ph.D. '99, professor of
computer science and associate
chair of education for the CS de
partment. "If you imagine the
same percentage of Honor Code
violations is taking place but now
the enrollment in the class is
twice what it used to be, you're
going to see twice as many viola
tions."

Moss: a measure of software
similarity
Few students realize that each
assignment they submit is run
through a program called Meas
ure of Software Similarity (Moss).
Moss is used to detect similarities
between code submissions, and is
considered a standard across
most U.S. institutions. Used by
computer science departments
worldwide, Moss was developed
by Stanford computer science
professor Alex Aiken.
Developed 20 years ago dur
ing Aiken's time as a professor at
UC-Berkeley, Moss is designed to
cut down the manual labor of
searching for plagiarism. Howev
er, Aiken emphasized that Moss is
not a system for detecting plagia
rism directly.
"What Moss detects is similar
ity," Aiken said. "Why the code is
similar is a human judgment that
has to be made."
Since code might be similar for
various reasons, including shared
libraries or starter code provided
for the course, an instructor much
check to see whether or not the
similarity returned by Moss con
stitutes plagiarism. Moss simply
helps professors determine which
programs should be flagged with
a higher priority for further re
view.
"It's kind of smart about what
'the same' means. It knows, for
example, that if you go through
and change all the variable
names, it doesn't matter," Aiken
said. "It knows some things about
programming that allow it to make
some judgments about when two
things are really the same and when
they're not."
Aiken explained that Stanford
uses Moss to compare submissions
not only against other students'
work in the class, but also against
code available online and submis
sions from previous years and quar
ters. The program looks for aspects
such as similar structure, identical
bugs and other unusual commonali
ties.
According to Stanford computer
science lecturer Julie Zelenski 'B9
M.S. '96, Moss also accounts for al
gorithms used by a significant num
ber of students.
"It also knows how to recognize
when something is just so idiomatic
that everyone did it the same way,"
Zelenski said.
Zelenski also explained that
since the introductory classes are so
large, a graduate student has been
hired to build tools to manage the lo
gistics of finding high-priority
matches in Moss for 106A and 1068
before passing the data on to the
course instructor.
Computer science lecturer
Marty Stepp also spoke about the
importance of having a teaching as
sistant (TA) to examine the Moss re
sults first.
"He does all of that part for us,
basically gets [the MOSS results] all
ready for us to look over, produces a
nice executive summary for us of the
data and places it in front of us in an
easy way for us to examine," Stepp
said. "We look over the top matches
and decide which ones are concern
ing to us, and that works really well
because he can help us have a faster
turnaround."
Stepp also emphasized that the
student does not play a role in decid
ing whether or not a case should be
pursued.
"The instructor should make
that decision so it's important to
note that his role has nothing to do
with innocence," Stepp said. "[The
TA] doesn't make that call for us. We
wouldn't ever farm that out to a
third party."
Stepp also explained that al
though the section leading program
plays a large role in grading assign
ments for students in 106A and
1068, section leaders are not re
sponsible for looking for plagiarism.
Instead, they are told to contact the
instructor if misconduct is suspect-

Ed, and according to Stepp, most of
the time section leaders do not have
the experience to accurately recog
nize an Honor Code violation.

Dealing with violations
If a violation is discovered, stu
dents usually have two options:
choosing the Early Resolution Op
tion (ERO) or allowingthe case to go
to a hearing.
When a case is brought to the Of
fice of Community Standards, a stu
dent is assigned a judicial officer to
advocate for the student. If the case
moves to trial and eventually a hear
ing, a panel of five students and one
faculty member determines
whether or not the student's actions
constitute a violation of the Honor
Code. If a student is found guilty by
a five-to-one vote, the panel assigns
a sanction to the student.
According to Stanford's Office of
Community Standards, standard
first-time sanctions are usually a
quarter of suspension and 40 hours
of community service unless the
panel finds that another response is
more appropriate.
First instituted in 2009, the ERO
gives students the opportunity to
immediately accept responsibility
for their actions and skip the judicial
hearing process. Zelenski explained
that the ERO gives students an in
centive to take responsibility for
their actions rather than lying to
avoid a sanction. In addition, while
hearings can take two months or
longer, the ERO can be resolved
within a few weeks.
"The vast majority of the stu
dents who I'm sending [to OCS] are
choosing to pursue an ERO alterna
tive [rather] than go to a full hear
ing," Zelenski said.
Even before sending a student to
the OCS, different instructors han
dle potential honor code violations
differently, Sahami said.
"Depending on the results they
get back [from Moss], some [in
structors] will just report them im
mediately without talking to the stu
dent. Some prefer to talk to the stu
dent," Sahami said. "We try to be
consistent with respect to how we
handle the Honor Code it's just a
matter of time constraints and per
sonal preference."
Sahami himself asks to meet with
students and gives them the chance
to take responsibility in advance be
fore telling them about the Moss
match.
"We have a conversation of what
happened, and what I look at are
things like how contrite is the stu
dent," Sahami said. "Virtually every
time I've talked to a student they're
very straightforward about what
happened. In some cases, it some

times takes them a little while to re
alize that honesty is the best policy,
and they shouldn't make up some
story to get out of the situation."
Sahami also explained that while
he is required to report the case to
the OCS, he is on a student's side
once he or she admits to violating
the Honor Code.
"I think the issue of academic
honesty should also be one that's not
just punitive but is really about
learning," Sahami said. "I'm in favor
for leniency on the side of students
who take responsibility."
As a new instructor in the CS de
partment this year, Stepp explained
that he in fact has not yet dealt with
any Honor Code violations, al
though he has not finished looking
through assignments from this
quarter.
"I'm lucky enough to say that I
have not forwarded any cases so far
in my last two quarters here at Stan
ford," Stepp said.
"I think that there are always
programs that come up in our list
ings that I feel are suspicious," he

added. "But I feel I have to be very
confident in a match in order to
make an accusation, and I haven't
done so."
In terms of repercussions, an
Honor Code case does not show up
on a student's transcript, but a nota
tion is kept on administrative record
for reference in case of future viola
tions.
According to Zelenski, common
forms of punishment include a fail
ing grade in the course, community
service, suspension or probation.
For repeated or unusual cases, ex
pulsion is also a rare consequence.
Why it happens: instructor per
spectives
Despite Stepp's violation-free
stint on the Farm, Zelenski ex
plained that in her experience teach
ing CS 107: Computer Organization
and Systems, she usually encoun
ters one or two cases for each of the
seven assignments.
Zelenski spoke about some of the
main causes for Honor Code viola
tions in CS, including the stress ere

ated by midnight deadlines and code
that does not work. She explained
that even if a program is well writ
ten, a small bug can cause big prob
lems that feel like failure.
"When you have a program that
doesn't work, it's usually really obvi
ous and really hard to cope with,"
Zelenski said. "The arbiter of cor
rectness is obvious and apparent."
"Having our deadlines at mid
night probably doesn't help because
in some sense that's maybe when
you're most weak when you're
tired," she added.
Furthermore, copying and past
ing working code from an online
source makes cheating in CS espe
cially easy compared to in other sub
jects.
"It's ridiculously easy," Zelenski
said. "It can all happen in just the
space of a few minutes when [a stu
dent is] just starting to feel panicked
and desperate."
In general, the availability of
code on the web has become an in
evitable problem, especially since
that form of plagiarism does not re
quire the consent of two parties. Al
though Zelenski regularly searches
the web for online versions of as
signments, she explained that catch
ing every instance is difficult and
spoke about a case from this quarter
in which around 10 students in CS
107 used parts of code that had been
uploaded to the software hosting
site Git Hub.
"At the beginning of the quarter
and a couple times along the way I
just do the obvious searches on all
the places that code gets put," Ze
lenski said. "If I ever find it and it's
from a student of mine, I send them
a very nice note and say I really
want this down."
In February, Zelenski discov
ered that a former CS 107 student
had uploaded the Crashßeporter
assignment online. She requested
the code be taken down, and the stu
dent complied, but not before a non-
Stanford student forked the reposi
tory, copying it to a completely dif
ferent location. When she later dis
covered the second version of the
code, Zelenski assumed students
would not find it.
"You have to be looking for the
code in ways [in which you] will find
code so I [thought], no one's going to
find it," Zelenski said. "Well, it turns
out I would be wrong about that
that there were a number of stu
dents who found it and totally used
it."
When 10 Honor Code cases were
revealed by the Moss results, Zelen
ski tried to ask the non-Stanford
student to take down the program.

such as similar structure, identical
bugs and other unusual commonali
ties.
According to Stanford computer
science lecturer Julie Zelenski 'B9
M.S. '96, Moss also accounts for al
gorithms used by a significant num
ber of students.
"It also knows how to recognize
when something is just so idiomatic
that everyone did it the same way,"
Zelenski said.
Zelenski also explained that
since the introductory classes are so
large, a graduate student has been
hired to build tools to manage the lo
gistics of finding high-priority
matches in Moss for 106A and 1068
before passing the data on to the
course instructor.
Computer science lecturer
Marty Stepp also spoke about the
importance of having a teaching as
sistant (TA) to examine the Moss re
sults first.
"He does all of that part for us,
basically gets [the MOSS results] all
ready for us to look over, produces a
nice executive summary for us of the
data and places it in front of us in an
easy way for us to examine," Stepp
said. "We look over the top matches
and decide which ones are concern
ing to us, and that works really well
because he can help us have a faster
turnaround."
Stepp also emphasized that the
student does not play a role in decid
ing whether or not a case should be
pursued.
"The instructor should make
that decision so it's important to
note that his role has nothing to do
with innocence," Stepp said. "[The
TA] doesn't make that call for us. We
wouldn't ever farm that out to a
third party."
Stepp also explained that al
though the section leading program
plays a large role in grading assign
ments for students in 106A and
1068, section leaders are not re
sponsible for looking for plagiarism.
Instead, they are told to contact the
instructor if misconduct is suspect-

Ed, and according to Stepp, most of
the time section leaders do not have
the experience to accurately recog
nize an Honor Code violation.

Dealing with violations
If a violation is discovered, stu
dents usually have two options:
choosing the Early Resolution Op
tion (ERO) or allowingthe case to go
to a hearing.
When a case is brought to the Of
fice of Community Standards, a stu
dent is assigned a judicial officer to
advocate for the student. If the case
moves to trial and eventually a hear
ing, a panel of five students and one
faculty member determines
whether or not the student's actions
constitute a violation of the Honor
Code. If a student is found guilty by
a five-to-one vote, the panel assigns
a sanction to the student.
According to Stanford's Office of
Community Standards, standard
first-time sanctions are usually a
quarter of suspension and 40 hours
of community service unless the
panel finds that another response is
more appropriate.
First instituted in 2009, the ERO
gives students the opportunity to
immediately accept responsibility
for their actions and skip the judicial
hearing process. Zelenski explained
that the ERO gives students an in
centive to take responsibility for
their actions rather than lying to
avoid a sanction. In addition, while
hearings can take two months or
longer, the ERO can be resolved
within a few weeks.
"The vast majority of the stu
dents who I'm sending [to OCS] are
choosing to pursue an ERO alterna
tive [rather] than go to a full hear
ing," Zelenski said.
Even before sending a student to
the OCS, different instructors han
dle potential honor code violations
differently, Sahami said.
"Depending on the results they
get back [from Moss], some [in
structors] will just report them im
mediately without talking to the stu
dent. Some prefer to talk to the stu
dent," Sahami said. "We try to be
consistent with respect to how we
handle the Honor Code it's just a
matter of time constraints and per
sonal preference."
Sahami himself asks to meet with
students and gives them the chance
to take responsibility in advance be
fore telling them about the Moss
match.
"We have a conversation of what
happened, and what I look at are
things like how contrite is the stu
dent," Sahami said. "Virtually every
time I've talked to a student they're
very straightforward about what
happened. In some cases, it some

times takes them a little while to re
alize that honesty is the best policy,
and they shouldn't make up some
story to get out of the situation."
Sahami also explained that while
he is required to report the case to
the OCS, he is on a student's side
once he or she admits to violating
the Honor Code.
"I think the issue of academic
honesty should also be one that's not
just punitive but is really about
learning," Sahami said. "I'm in favor
for leniency on the side of students
who take responsibility."
As a new instructor in the CS de
partment this year, Stepp explained
that he in fact has not yet dealt with
any Honor Code violations, al
though he has not finished looking
through assignments from this
quarter.
"I'm lucky enough to say that I
have not forwarded any cases so far
in my last two quarters here at Stan
ford," Stepp said.
"I think that there are always
programs that come up in our list
ings that I feel are suspicious," he

added. "But I feel I have to be very
confident in a match in order to
make an accusation, and I haven't
done so."
In terms of repercussions, an
Honor Code case does not show up
on a student's transcript, but a nota
tion is kept on administrative record
for reference in case of future viola
tions.
According to Zelenski, common
forms of punishment include a fail
ing grade in the course, community
service, suspension or probation.
For repeated or unusual cases, ex
pulsion is also a rare consequence.
Why it happens: instructor per
spectives
Despite Stepp's violation-free
stint on the Farm, Zelenski ex
plained that in her experience teach
ing CS 107: Computer Organization
and Systems, she usually encoun
ters one or two cases for each of the
seven assignments.
Zelenski spoke about some of the
main causes for Honor Code viola
tions in CS, including the stress ere

ated by midnight deadlines and code
that does not work. She explained
that even if a program is well writ
ten, a small bug can cause big prob
lems that feel like failure.
"When you have a program that
doesn't work, it's usually really obvi
ous and really hard to cope with,"
Zelenski said. "The arbiter of cor
rectness is obvious and apparent."
"Having our deadlines at mid
night probably doesn't help because
in some sense that's maybe when
you're most weak when you're
tired," she added.
Furthermore, copying and past
ing working code from an online
source makes cheating in CS espe
cially easy compared to in other sub
jects.
"It's ridiculously easy," Zelenski
said. "It can all happen in just the
space of a few minutes when [a stu
dent is] just starting to feel panicked
and desperate."
In general, the availability of
code on the web has become an in
evitable problem, especially since
that form of plagiarism does not re
quire the consent of two parties. Al
though Zelenski regularly searches
the web for online versions of as
signments, she explained that catch
ing every instance is difficult and
spoke about a case from this quarter
in which around 10 students in CS
107 used parts of code that had been
uploaded to the software hosting
site Git Hub.
"At the beginning of the quarter
and a couple times along the way I
just do the obvious searches on all
the places that code gets put," Ze
lenski said. "If I ever find it and it's
from a student of mine, I send them
a very nice note and say I really
want this down."
In February, Zelenski discov
ered that a former CS 107 student
had uploaded the Crashßeporter
assignment online. She requested
the code be taken down, and the stu
dent complied, but not before a non-
Stanford student forked the reposi
tory, copying it to a completely dif
ferent location. When she later dis
covered the second version of the
code, Zelenski assumed students
would not find it.
"You have to be looking for the
code in ways [in which you] will find
code so I [thought], no one's going to
find it," Zelenski said. "Well, it turns
out I would be wrong about that
that there were a number of stu
dents who found it and totally used
it."
When 10 Honor Code cases were
revealed by the Moss results, Zelen
ski tried to ask the non-Stanford
student to take down the program.


VICTOR XU/The Stanford Daily
After a lack of response, she eventu
ally worked with the student who
originally owned the code to use a
Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(DMCA) procedure to remove the
code from Git Hub.
Despite the hassle, Zelenski ex
plained that getting assignments off
the web was worth the time. She
used the incident as proof that, given
the opportunity, some students will
plagiarize.
"If you get the code off the web,
you just bring down the incident
rate," Zelenski said.
Stepp further emphasized the ef
fects of having code available online,
especially for introductory classes.
He explained that the problem is
compounded by the fact that assign
ments in CS classes are often kept
constant for several years, and new
ones are difficult to create.
"It takes more time to produce a
high-quality computer science
homework assignment than, say, a
math assignment," Stepp said. "On a
math assignment, you can produce
some new problems by changing
some of the numbers and some of
the variables and you have a new
equation to solve."
Stepp also discussed the fact that
students who took the class in the
past are more likely to share their
solutions than students currently
taking it.
"I think students who took a
class a long time ago are more cava
lier about handing out their solu
tion," Stepp said. "But if they just
wrote it and someone else didn't

write it and they want to take it, I
think the friend is less likely to
[share the code]."
Zelenski believes that another
source of Honor Code violations is
students' belief that they can beat
the system. With Moss mostly unad
vertised in Honor Code discussions
at the beginning of courses, many
students do not understand how
easy it is for instructors to catch pla
giarism.
"I do not think that the computer
science students at Stanford are
somehow more vulnerable, less
committed to integrity than our po
litical science students or [other ma
jors]," Zelenski said. "There's a cer
tain kind of confluence of motive and
opportunity and desperation, and I
think there's also the fact that we
can find it."
Stepp also emphasized that, de
spite stereotypes in the discipline,
collaboration is not the same as pla
giarism.
"We do want people to work to
gether and talk to each other we
just don't want them to share their
solutions with each other," Stepp
said. "There's a line. I think most
people know what that line is, and
it's unfortunate that some people
cross the line, but I think it's possi
ble to have a decent amount of col
laboration with other students with
out crossing that line."
Why it happens: student perspectives
Unsurprisingly, students told a
similar story about the effects of
stress in contributing to Honor
Code violations. Two students, Jeff
Taylor and Walter Smith both
names have been changed to pro
tect their identities spoke about
their experience with the ERO sys
tem in particular.

Taylor and Smith had been
working as a pair on a group CS
final project, but when Smith al
lowed a friend outside the team to
look at their code, they received an
unexpected email from their in
structor after assignments were
submitted.
Unknown to either student, the
friend had copied part of Taylor and
Smith's code and submitted it as his
own. The friend claimed that the
submission had been an accident,
and the case ended with an ERO.
Although neither Taylor nor Smith
were charged with an Honor Code
violation, Smith's friend reportedly
received a failing grade on the as
signment.
When asked about the case,
Smith and Taylor shared their
thoughts about why students might
choose to plagiarize.
"There are very few times in
which you break the Honor Code
for anything but grades. It's just
pressure," Smith said. "The dead
line is set at 12 a.m. and you've been
working on it for 10 hours, and you
just have one bug left, but you're
helpless and so you go to someone
for help just to get this one bug."
Taylor spoke about the fine line
between getting help from a friend
and cheating in writing code.
"There's a very fuzzy line from
getting help and cheating in CS,"
Taylor said. "If you need to find a
bug, instead of spending three
hours doing it, you can go to some
one and do it in five minutes. And if
you get in the habit of doing that,
you will basically have other people
writing your code. A lot of it is pres
sure or procrastination."
"In the case of CS specifically,
the getting help expedites the
process so much," he added. "And it

can snowball into cheating."
Smith observed that interna
tional students in particular feel
pressure to do well from family at
home.
"International students seem to
face this [pressure] a little bit more
than people from [the United
States]," Smith said. "There's more
pressure from back home to do well
in academics, to do really well. If
you get a B, it's unacceptable at any
level. While here, people realize
that it's Stanford and that getting a
B here is not that bad. But back
home no one knows what Stanford
is or the grading scheme."
Yet neither student felt that
cheating was ever justified, and
both believed that plagiarizing
without learning the material would
only hurt a student in the long run.
"The popular opinion is that it's
morally wrong to cheat because you
should learn the material for your
self," Taylor said. "In other coun
tries, cheating is an option."
Curbing cheating in the future
With the rising number of online
sources for code, instructors have
continued to investigate ways to dis
courage students from plagiarizing.
Stepp attributed his lack of Honor
Code cases to his slight alterations
to the assignments as a new lecturer.
Stepp has also added popups to
the class websites to caution stu
dents against plagiarism whenever
they download or submit an assign
ment. According to Stepp, research
has shown that reminders do in fact
affect the probability of a student's
choosing to cheat, especially if the
reminder comes before the student
starts an assignment.
"It's really hard to know what
factors have an impact and which

ones don't, but there has been edu
cational research that shows if you
remind students about these things
at key moments that it can make a
difference," Stepp said.
Jessie Duan 'l5, a student on the
Board of Judicial Affairs, spoke
about how the Board has been dis
cussing raising awareness about
Honor Code violations. One poten
tial effort includes talking to fresh
men about plagiarism.
"One thing we have been focus
ing on is raising awareness," Duan
said. "We've been talking about
reaching out to freshman dorms
more, making it more obvious from
the moment you get accepted into
Stanford [that] the Fundamental
Standard is this very important
thing."
Each computer science lecturer
and professor emphasized that the
department has gained a bad repu
tation for Honor Code violations
simply because it has the tools to
search for plagiarism.
"I think that it is true that com
puter science departments as a
whole tend to do more checking
than other departments," Aiken
said. "A lot of what you find depends
on whether you're looking."
Stepp also wanted to dispel the
misconception that students need to
work alone on CS assignments.
"There is a stereotype that we
don't want anyone to talk to anyone
and that computer science is isolated
and that you're not allowed to have
any contact with other people, and
you have to figure it out all by your
self with no help whatsoever," Stepp
said. "And I think that's a little bit un
fortunate because it's not true."

It's 11 p.m. Your program is
crashing, and the assignment is
due at midnight. You know where
your error is, but you don't know
how to fix it. A simple Google
search pulls up tons of working
code, but copying that directly
into your program would be vio
lating the Honor Code.
Yet it seems like there are al
ways some students who give in to
the temptation.
Stanford's Office of Communi
ty Standards' annual case reports
demonstrate a steady increase in
the number of Honor Code viola
tions in computer science (CS)
each year.
However, the enrollment in
CS classes has also risen signifi
cantly over the last five years. In
the 2013-14 academic year, over
1,500 students took CS 106A:
Programming Methodology, the
first course of the introductory
programming series in the CS
department, and computer sci
ence has grown into the largest
major on campus.
"Enrollments are on the
rise," said Mehran Sahami '92
M.S. '93 Ph.D. '99, professor of
computer science and associate
chair of education for the CS de
partment. "If you imagine the
same percentage of Honor Code
violations is taking place but now
the enrollment in the class is
twice what it used to be, you're
going to see twice as many viola
tions."

Moss: a measure of software
similarity
Few students realize that each
assignment they submit is run
through a program called Meas
ure of Software Similarity (Moss).
Moss is used to detect similarities
between code submissions, and is
considered a standard across
most U.S. institutions. Used by
computer science departments
worldwide, Moss was developed
by Stanford computer science
professor Alex Aiken.
Developed 20 years ago dur
ing Aiken's time as a professor at
UC-Berkeley, Moss is designed to
cut down the manual labor of
searching for plagiarism. Howev
er, Aiken emphasized that Moss is
not a system for detecting plagia
rism directly.
"What Moss detects is similar
ity," Aiken said. "Why the code is
similar is a human judgment that
has to be made."
Since code might be similar for
various reasons, including shared
libraries or starter code provided
for the course, an instructor much
check to see whether or not the
similarity returned by Moss con
stitutes plagiarism. Moss simply
helps professors determine which
programs should be flagged with
a higher priority for further re
view.
"It's kind of smart about what
'the same' means. It knows, for
example, that if you go through
and change all the variable
names, it doesn't matter," Aiken
said. "It knows some things about
programming that allow it to make
some judgments about when two
things are really the same and when
they're not."
Aiken explained that Stanford
uses Moss to compare submissions
not only against other students'
work in the class, but also against
code available online and submis
sions from previous years and quar
ters. The program looks for aspects
such as similar structure, identical
bugs and other unusual commonali
ties.
According to Stanford computer
science lecturer Julie Zelenski 'B9
M.S. '96, Moss also accounts for al
gorithms used by a significant num
ber of students.
"It also knows how to recognize
when something is just so idiomatic

Zelenski said.
Zelenski also explained that
since the introductory classes are so
large, a graduate student has been

gistics of finding high-priority
matches in Moss for 106A and 1068
before passing the data on to the
course instructor.

cross the line, but I think it's possi
ble to have a decent amount of col
laboration with other students with
out crossing that line."
Why it happens: student perspectives
Unsurprisingly, students told a
similar story about the effects of
stress in contributing to Honor
Code violations. Two students, Jeff
Taylor and Walter Smith both
names have been changed to pro
tect their identities spoke about
their experience with the ERO sys
tem in particular.

Taylor and Smith had been
working as a pair on a group CS
final project, but when Smith al
lowed a friend outside the team to
look at their code, they received an
unexpected email from their in
structor after assignments were
submitted.
Unknown to either student, the
friend had copied part of Taylor and
Smith's code and submitted it as his
own. The friend claimed that the
submission had been an accident,
and the case ended with an ERO.
Although neither Taylor nor Smith
were charged with an Honor Code
violation, Smith's friend reportedly
received a failing grade on the as
signment.
When asked about the case,
Smith and Taylor shared their
thoughts about why students might
choose to plagiarize.
"There are very few times in
which you break the Honor Code
for anything but grades. It's just
pressure," Smith said. "The dead
line is set at 12 a.m. and you've been
working on it for 10 hours, and you
just have one bug left, but you're
helpless and so you go to someone
for help just to get this one bug."
Taylor spoke about the fine line
between getting help from a friend
and cheating in writing code.
"There's a very fuzzy line from
getting help and cheating in CS,"
Taylor said. "If you need to find a
bug, instead of spending three
hours doing it, you can go to some
one and do it in five minutes. And if
you get in the habit of doing that,
you will basically have other people
writing your code. A lot of it is pres
sure or procrastination."
"In the case of CS specifically,
the getting help expedites the
process so much," he added. "And it

can snowball into cheating."
Smith observed that interna
tional students in particular feel
pressure to do well from family at
home.
"International students seem to
face this [pressure] a little bit more
than people from [the United
States]," Smith said. "There's more
pressure from back home to do well
in academics, to do really well. If
you get a B, it's unacceptable at any
level. While here, people realize
that it's Stanford and that getting a
B here is not that bad. But back
home no one knows what Stanford
is or the grading scheme."
Yet neither student felt that
cheating was ever justified, and
both believed that plagiarizing
without learning the material would
only hurt a student in the long run.
"The popular opinion is that it's
morally wrong to cheat because you
should learn the material for your
self," Taylor said. "In other coun
tries, cheating is an option."
Curbing cheating in the future
With the rising number of online
sources for code, instructors have
continued to investigate ways to dis
courage students from plagiarizing.
Stepp attributed his lack of Honor
Code cases to his slight alterations
to the assignments as a new lecturer.
Stepp has also added popups to
the class websites to caution stu
dents against plagiarism whenever
they download or submit an assign
ment. According to Stepp, research
has shown that reminders do in fact
affect the probability of a student's
choosing to cheat, especially if the
reminder comes before the student
starts an assignment.
"It's really hard to know what
factors have an impact and which

ones don't, but there has been edu
cational research that shows if you
remind students about these things
at key moments that it can make a
difference," Stepp said.
Jessie Duan 'l5, a student on the
Board of Judicial Affairs, spoke
about how the Board has been dis
cussing raising awareness about
Honor Code violations. One poten
tial effort includes talking to fresh
men about plagiarism.
"One thing we have been focus
ing on is raising awareness," Duan
said. "We've been talking about
reaching out to freshman dorms
more, making it more obvious from
the moment you get accepted into
Stanford [that] the Fundamental
Standard is this very important
thing."
Each computer science lecturer
and professor emphasized that the
department has gained a bad repu
tation for Honor Code violations
simply because it has the tools to
search for plagiarism.
"I think that it is true that com
puter science departments as a
whole tend to do more checking
than other departments," Aiken
said. "A lot of what you find depends
on whether you're looking."
Stepp also wanted to dispel the
misconception that students need to
work alone on CS assignments.
"There is a stereotype that we
don't want anyone to talk to anyone
and that computer science is isolated
and that you're not allowed to have
any contact with other people, and
you have to figure it out all by your
self with no help whatsoever," Stepp
said. "And I think that's a little bit un
fortunate because it's not true."

It's 11 p.m. Your program is
crashing, and the assignment is
due at midnight. You know where
your error is, but you don't know
how to fix it. A simple Google
search pulls up tons of working
code, but copying that directly
into your program would be vio
lating the Honor Code.
Yet it seems like there are al
ways some students who give in to
the temptation.
Stanford's Office of Communi
ty Standards' annual case reports
demonstrate a steady increase in
the number of Honor Code viola
tions in computer science (CS)
each year.
However, the enrollment in
CS classes has also risen signifi
cantly over the last five years. In
the 2013-14 academic year, over
1,500 students took CS 106A:
Programming Methodology, the
first course of the introductory
programming series in the CS
department, and computer sci
ence has grown into the largest
major on campus.
"Enrollments are on the
rise," said Mehran Sahami '92
M.S. '93 Ph.D. '99, professor of
computer science and associate
chair of education for the CS de
partment. "If you imagine the
same percentage of Honor Code
violations is taking place but now
the enrollment in the class is
twice what it used to be, you're
going to see twice as many viola
tions."

Moss: a measure of software
similarity
Few students realize that each
assignment they submit is run
through a program called Meas
ure of Software Similarity (Moss).
Moss is used to detect similarities
between code submissions, and is
considered a standard across
most U.S. institutions. Used by
computer science departments
worldwide, Moss was developed
by Stanford computer science
professor Alex Aiken.
Developed 20 years ago dur
ing Aiken's time as a professor at
UC-Berkeley, Moss is designed to
cut down the manual labor of
searching for plagiarism. Howev
er, Aiken emphasized that Moss is
not a system for detecting plagia
rism directly.
"What Moss detects is similar
ity," Aiken said. "Why the code is
similar is a human judgment that
has to be made."
Since code might be similar for
various reasons, including shared
libraries or starter code provided
for the course, an instructor much
check to see whether or not the
similarity returned by Moss con
stitutes plagiarism. Moss simply
helps professors determine which
programs should be flagged with
a higher priority for further re
view.
"It's kind of smart about what
'the same' means. It knows, for
example, that if you go through
and change all the variable
names, it doesn't matter," Aiken
said. "It knows some things about
programming that allow it to make
some judgments about when two
things are really the same and when
they're not."
Aiken explained that Stanford
uses Moss to compare submissions
not only against other students'
work in the class, but also against
code available online and submis
sions from previous years and quar
ters. The program looks for aspects
such as similar structure, identical
bugs and other unusual commonali
ties.
According to Stanford computer
science lecturer Julie Zelenski 'B9
M.S. '96, Moss also accounts for al
gorithms used by a significant num
ber of students.
"It also knows how to recognize
when something is just so idiomatic
that everyone did it the same way,"
Zelenski said.
Zelenski also explained that
since the introductory classes are so
large, a graduate student has been
hired to build tools to manage the lo
gistics of finding high-priority
matches in Moss for 106A and 1068
before passing the data on to the
course instructor.
Computer science lecturer
Marty Stepp also spoke about the
importance of having a teaching as
sistant (TA) to examine the Moss re
sults first.
"He does all of that part for us,
basically gets [the MOSS results] all
ready for us to look over, produces a
nice executive summary for us of the
data and places it in front of us in an
easy way for us to examine," Stepp
said. "We look over the top matches
and decide which ones are concern
ing to us, and that works really well
because he can help us have a faster
turnaround."
Stepp also emphasized that the
student does not play a role in decid
ing whether or not a case should be
pursued.
"The instructor should make
that decision so it's important to
note that his role has nothing to do
with innocence," Stepp said. "[The
TA] doesn't make that call for us. We
wouldn't ever farm that out to a
third party."
Stepp also explained that al
though the section leading program
plays a large role in grading assign
ments for students in 106A and
1068, section leaders are not re
sponsible for looking for plagiarism.
Instead, they are told to contact the
instructor if misconduct is suspect-

Ed, and according to Stepp, most of
the time section leaders do not have
the experience to accurately recog
nize an Honor Code violation.

Dealing with violations
If a violation is discovered, stu
dents usually have two options:
choosing the Early Resolution Op
tion (ERO) or allowingthe case to go
to a hearing.
When a case is brought to the Of
fice of Community Standards, a stu
dent is assigned a judicial officer to
advocate for the student. If the case
moves to trial and eventually a hear
ing, a panel of five students and one
faculty member determines
whether or not the student's actions
constitute a violation of the Honor
Code. If a student is found guilty by
a five-to-one vote, the panel assigns
a sanction to the student.
According to Stanford's Office of
Community Standards, standard
first-time sanctions are usually a
quarter of suspension and 40 hours
of community service unless the
panel finds that another response is
more appropriate.
First instituted in 2009, the ERO
gives students the opportunity to
immediately accept responsibility
for their actions and skip the judicial
hearing process. Zelenski explained
that the ERO gives students an in
centive to take responsibility for
their actions rather than lying to
avoid a sanction. In addition, while
hearings can take two months or
longer, the ERO can be resolved
within a few weeks.
"The vast majority of the stu
dents who I'm sending [to OCS] are
choosing to pursue an ERO alterna
tive [rather] than go to a full hear
ing," Zelenski said.
Even before sending a student to
the OCS, different instructors han
dle potential honor code violations
differently, Sahami said.
"Depending on the results they
get back [from Moss], some [in
structors] will just report them im
mediately without talking to the stu
dent. Some prefer to talk to the stu
dent," Sahami said. "We try to be
consistent with respect to how we
handle the Honor Code it's just a
matter of time constraints and per
sonal preference."
Sahami himself asks to meet with
students and gives them the chance
to take responsibility in advance be
fore telling them about the Moss
match.
"We have a conversation of what
happened, and what I look at are
things like how contrite is the stu
dent," Sahami said. "Virtually every
time I've talked to a student they're
very straightforward about what
happened. In some cases, it some

times takes them a little while to re
alize that honesty is the best policy,
and they shouldn't make up some
story to get out of the situation."
Sahami also explained that while
he is required to report the case to
the OCS, he is on a student's side
once he or she admits to violating
the Honor Code.
"I think the issue of academic
honesty should also be one that's not
just punitive but is really about
learning," Sahami said. "I'm in favor
for leniency on the side of students
who take responsibility."
As a new instructor in the CS de
partment this year, Stepp explained
that he in fact has not yet dealt with
any Honor Code violations, al
though he has not finished looking
through assignments from this
quarter.
"I'm lucky enough to say that I
have not forwarded any cases so far
in my last two quarters here at Stan
ford," Stepp said.
"I think that there are always
programs that come up in our list
ings that I feel are suspicious," he

added. "But I feel I have to be very
confident in a match in order to
make an accusation, and I haven't
done so."
In terms of repercussions, an
Honor Code case does not show up
on a student's transcript, but a nota
tion is kept on administrative record
for reference in case of future viola
tions.
According to Zelenski, common
forms of punishment include a fail
ing grade in the course, community
service, suspension or probation.
For repeated or unusual cases, ex
pulsion is also a rare consequence.
Why it happens: instructor per
spectives
Despite Stepp's violation-free
stint on the Farm, Zelenski ex
plained that in her experience teach
ing CS 107: Computer Organization
and Systems, she usually encoun
ters one or two cases for each of the
seven assignments.
Zelenski spoke about some of the
main causes for Honor Code viola
tions in CS, including the stress ere

ated by midnight deadlines and code
that does not work. She explained
that even if a program is well writ
ten, a small bug can cause big prob
lems that feel like failure.
"When you have a program that
doesn't work, it's usually really obvi
ous and really hard to cope with,"
Zelenski said. "The arbiter of cor
rectness is obvious and apparent."
"Having our deadlines at mid
night probably doesn't help because
in some sense that's maybe when
you're most weak when you're
tired," she added.
Furthermore, copying and past
ing working code from an online
source makes cheating in CS espe
cially easy compared to in other sub
jects.
"It's ridiculously easy," Zelenski
said. "It can all happen in just the
space of a few minutes when [a stu
dent is] just starting to feel panicked
and desperate."
In general, the availability of
code on the web has become an in
evitable problem, especially since
that form of plagiarism does not re
quire the consent of two parties. Al
though Zelenski regularly searches
the web for online versions of as
signments, she explained that catch
ing every instance is difficult and
spoke about a case from this quarter
in which around 10 students in CS
107 used parts of code that had been
uploaded to the software hosting
site Git Hub.
"At the beginning of the quarter
and a couple times along the way I
just do the obvious searches on all
the places that code gets put," Ze
lenski said. "If I ever find it and it's
from a student of mine, I send them
a very nice note and say I really
want this down."
In February, Zelenski discov
ered that a former CS 107 student
had uploaded the Crashßeporter
assignment online. She requested
the code be taken down, and the stu
dent complied, but not before a non-
Stanford student forked the reposi
tory, copying it to a completely dif
ferent location. When she later dis
covered the second version of the
code, Zelenski assumed students
would not find it.
"You have to be looking for the
code in ways [in which you] will find
code so I [thought], no one's going to
find it," Zelenski said. "Well, it turns
out I would be wrong about that
that there were a number of stu
dents who found it and totally used
it."
When 10 Honor Code cases were
revealed by the Moss results, Zelen
ski tried to ask the non-Stanford
student to take down the program.


VICTOR XU/The Stanford Daily
After a lack of response, she eventu
ally worked with the student who
originally owned the code to use a
Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(DMCA) procedure to remove the
code from Git Hub.
Despite the hassle, Zelenski ex
plained that getting assignments off
the web was worth the time. She
used the incident as proof that, given
the opportunity, some students will
plagiarize.
"If you get the code off the web,
you just bring down the incident
rate," Zelenski said.
Stepp further emphasized the ef
fects of having code available online,
especially for introductory classes.
He explained that the problem is
compounded by the fact that assign
ments in CS classes are often kept
constant for several years, and new
ones are difficult to create.
"It takes more time to produce a
high-quality computer science
homework assignment than, say, a
math assignment," Stepp said. "On a
math assignment, you can produce
some new problems by changing
some of the numbers and some of
the variables and you have a new
equation to solve."
Stepp also discussed the fact that
students who took the class in the
past are more likely to share their
solutions than students currently
taking it.
"I think students who took a
class a long time ago are more cava
lier about handing out their solu
tion," Stepp said. "But if they just
wrote it and someone else didn't

write it and they want to take it, I
think the friend is less likely to
[share the code]."
Zelenski believes that another
source of Honor Code violations is
students' belief that they can beat
the system. With Moss mostly unad
vertised in Honor Code discussions
at the beginning of courses, many
students do not understand how
easy it is for instructors to catch pla
giarism.
"I do not think that the computer
science students at Stanford are
somehow more vulnerable, less
committed to integrity than our po
litical science students or [other ma
jors]," Zelenski said. "There's a cer
tain kind of confluence of motive and
opportunity and desperation, and I
think there's also the fact that we
can find it."
Stepp also emphasized that, de
spite stereotypes in the discipline,
collaboration is not the same as pla
giarism.
"We do want people to work to
gether and talk to each other we
just don't want them to share their
solutions with each other," Stepp
said. "There's a line. I think most
people know what that line is, and
it's unfortunate that some people
cross the line, but I think it's possi
ble to have a decent amount of col
laboration with other students with
out crossing that line."

their actions rather than lying to
avoid a sanction. In addition, while
hearings can take two months or
longer, the ERO can be resolved
within a few weeks.
"The vast majority of the stu
dents who I'm sending [to OCS] are
choosing to pursue an ERO alterna
tive [rather] than go to a full hear
ing," Zelenski said.
Even before sending a student to
the OCS, different instructors han
dle potential honor code violations
differently, Sahami said.
"Depending on the results they
get back [from Moss], some [in
structors] will just report them im
mediately without talking to the stu
dent. Some prefer to talk to the stu
dent," Sahami said. "We try to be
consistent with respect to how we
handle the Honor Code it's just a
matter of time constraints and per
sonal preference."
Sahami himself asks to meet with
students and gives them the chance
to take responsibility in advance be
fore telling them about the Moss
match.
"We have a conversation of what
happened, and what I look at are
things like how contrite is the stu
dent," Sahami said. "Virtually every
time I've talked to a student they're
very straightforward about what
happened. In some cases, it some

times takes them a little while to re
alize that honesty is the best policy,
and they shouldn't make up some
story to get out of the situation."
Sahami also explained that while
he is required to report the case to
the OCS, he is on a student's side
once he or she admits to violating
the Honor Code.
"I think the issue of academic
honesty should also be one that's not
just punitive but is really about
learning," Sahami said. "I'm in favor
for leniency on the side of students
who take responsibility."
As a new instructor in the CS de
partment this year, Stepp explained
that he in fact has not yet dealt with
any Honor Code violations, al
though he has not finished looking
through assignments from this
quarter.
"I'm lucky enough to say that I
have not forwarded any cases so far
in my last two quarters here at Stan
ford," Stepp said.
"I think that there are always
programs that come up in our list
ings that I feel are suspicious," he

added. "But I feel I have to be very
confident in a match in order to
make an accusation, and I haven't
done so."
In terms of repercussions, an
Honor Code case does not show up
on a student's transcript, but a nota
tion is kept on administrative record
for reference in case of future viola
tions.
According to Zelenski, common
forms of punishment include a fail
ing grade in the course, community
service, suspension or probation.
For repeated or unusual cases, ex
pulsion is also a rare consequence.
Why it happens: instructor per
spectives
Despite Stepp's violation-free
stint on the Farm, Zelenski ex
plained that in her experience teach
ing CS 107: Computer Organization
and Systems, she usually encoun
ters one or two cases for each of the
seven assignments.
Zelenski spoke about some of the
main causes for Honor Code viola
tions in CS, including the stress ere

ated by midnight deadlines and code
that does not work. She explained
that even if a program is well writ
ten, a small bug can cause big prob
lems that feel like failure.
"When you have a program that
doesn't work, it's usually really obvi
ous and really hard to cope with,"
Zelenski said. "The arbiter of cor
rectness is obvious and apparent."
"Having our deadlines at mid
night probably doesn't help because
in some sense that's maybe when
you're most weak when you're
tired," she added.
Furthermore, copying and past
ing working code from an online
source makes cheating in CS espe
cially easy compared to in other sub
jects.
"It's ridiculously easy," Zelenski
said. "It can all happen in just the
space of a few minutes when [a stu
dent is] just starting to feel panicked
and desperate."
In general, the availability of
code on the web has become an in
evitable problem, especially since
that form of plagiarism does not re
quire the consent of two parties. Al
though Zelenski regularly searches
the web for online versions of as
signments, she explained that catch
ing every instance is difficult and
spoke about a case from this quarter
in which around 10 students in CS
107 used parts of code that had been
uploaded to the software hosting
site Git Hub.
"At the beginning of the quarter
and a couple times along the way I
just do the obvious searches on all
the places that code gets put," Ze
lenski said. "If I ever find it and it's
from a student of mine, I send them
a very nice note and say I really
want this down."
In February, Zelenski discov
ered that a former CS 107 student
had uploaded the Crashßeporter
assignment online. She requested
the code be taken down, and the stu
dent complied, but not before a non-
Stanford student forked the reposi
tory, copying it to a completely dif
ferent location. When she later dis
covered the second version of the
code, Zelenski assumed students
would not find it.
"You have to be looking for the
code in ways [in which you] will find
code so I [thought], no one's going to
find it," Zelenski said. "Well, it turns
out I would be wrong about that
that there were a number of stu
dents who found it and totally used
it."
When 10 Honor Code cases were
revealed by the Moss results, Zelen
ski tried to ask the non-Stanford
student to take down the program.


VICTOR XU/The Stanford Daily
After a lack of response, she eventu
ally worked with the student who
originally owned the code to use a
Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(DMCA) procedure to remove the
code from Git Hub.
Despite the hassle, Zelenski ex
plained that getting assignments off
the web was worth the time. She
used the incident as proof that, given
the opportunity, some students will
plagiarize.
"If you get the code off the web,
you just bring down the incident
rate," Zelenski said.
Stepp further emphasized the ef
fects of having code available online,
especially for introductory classes.
He explained that the problem is
compounded by the fact that assign
ments in CS classes are often kept
constant for several years, and new
ones are difficult to create.
"It takes more time to produce a
high-quality computer science
homework assignment than, say, a
math assignment," Stepp said. "On a
math assignment, you can produce
some new problems by changing
some of the numbers and some of
the variables and you have a new
equation to solve."
Stepp also discussed the fact that
students who took the class in the
past are more likely to share their
solutions than students currently
taking it.
"I think students who took a
class a long time ago are more cava
lier about handing out their solu
tion," Stepp said. "But if they just
wrote it and someone else didn't

write it and they want to take it, I
think the friend is less likely to
[share the code]."
Zelenski believes that another
source of Honor Code violations is
students' belief that they can beat
the system. With Moss mostly unad
vertised in Honor Code discussions
at the beginning of courses, many
students do not understand how
easy it is for instructors to catch pla
giarism.
"I do not think that the computer
science students at Stanford are
somehow more vulnerable, less
committed to integrity than our po
litical science students or [other ma
jors]," Zelenski said. "There's a cer
tain kind of confluence of motive and
opportunity and desperation, and I
think there's also the fact that we
can find it."
Stepp also emphasized that, de
spite stereotypes in the discipline,
collaboration is not the same as pla
giarism.
"We do want people to work to
gether and talk to each other we
just don't want them to share their
solutions with each other," Stepp
said. "There's a line. I think most
people know what that line is, and
it's unfortunate that some people
cross the line, but I think it's possi
ble to have a decent amount of col
laboration with other students with
out crossing that line."
Why it happens: student perspectives
Unsurprisingly, students told a
similar story about the effects of
stress in contributing to Honor
Code violations. Two students, Jeff
Taylor and Walter Smith both
names have been changed to pro
tect their identities spoke about
their experience with the ERO sys
tem in particular.

Taylor and Smith had been
working as a pair on a group CS
final project, but when Smith al
lowed a friend outside the team to
look at their code, they received an
unexpected email from their in
structor after assignments were
submitted.
Unknown to either student, the
friend had copied part of Taylor and
Smith's code and submitted it as his
own. The friend claimed that the
submission had been an accident,
and the case ended with an ERO.
Although neither Taylor nor Smith
were charged with an Honor Code
violation, Smith's friend reportedly
received a failing grade on the as
signment.
When asked about the case,
Smith and Taylor shared their
thoughts about why students might
choose to plagiarize.
"There are very few times in
which you break the Honor Code
for anything but grades. It's just
pressure," Smith said. "The dead
line is set at 12 a.m. and you've been
working on it for 10 hours, and you
just have one bug left, but you're
helpless and so you go to someone
for help just to get this one bug."
Taylor spoke about the fine line
between getting help from a friend
and cheating in writing code.
"There's a very fuzzy line from
getting help and cheating in CS,"
Taylor said. "If you need to find a
bug, instead of spending three
hours doing it, you can go to some
one and do it in five minutes. And if
you get in the habit of doing that,
you will basically have other people
writing your code. A lot of it is pres
sure or procrastination."
"In the case of CS specifically,
the getting help expedites the
process so much," he added. "And it

can snowball into cheating."
Smith observed that interna
tional students in particular feel
pressure to do well from family at
home.
"International students seem to
face this [pressure] a little bit more
than people from [the United
States]," Smith said. "There's more
pressure from back home to do well
in academics, to do really well. If
you get a B, it's unacceptable at any
level. While here, people realize
that it's Stanford and that getting a
B here is not that bad. But back
home no one knows what Stanford
is or the grading scheme."
Yet neither student felt that
cheating was ever justified, and
both believed that plagiarizing
without learning the material would
only hurt a student in the long run.
"The popular opinion is that it's
morally wrong to cheat because you
should learn the material for your
self," Taylor said. "In other coun
tries, cheating is an option."
Curbing cheating in the future
With the rising number of online
sources for code, instructors have
continued to investigate ways to dis
courage students from plagiarizing.
Stepp attributed his lack of Honor
Code cases to his slight alterations
to the assignments as a new lecturer.
Stepp has also added popups to
the class websites to caution stu
dents against plagiarism whenever
they download or submit an assign
ment. According to Stepp, research
has shown that reminders do in fact
affect the probability of a student's
choosing to cheat, especially if the
reminder comes before the student
starts an assignment.
"It's really hard to know what
factors have an impact and which

ones don't, but there has been edu
cational research that shows if you
remind students about these things
at key moments that it can make a
difference," Stepp said.
Jessie Duan 'l5, a student on the
Board of Judicial Affairs, spoke
about how the Board has been dis
cussing raising awareness about
Honor Code violations. One poten
tial effort includes talking to fresh
men about plagiarism.
"One thing we have been focus
ing on is raising awareness," Duan
said. "We've been talking about
reaching out to freshman dorms
more, making it more obvious from
the moment you get accepted into
Stanford [that] the Fundamental
Standard is this very important
thing."
Each computer science lecturer
and professor emphasized that the
department has gained a bad repu
tation for Honor Code violations
simply because it has the tools to
search for plagiarism.
"I think that it is true that com
puter science departments as a
whole tend to do more checking
than other departments," Aiken
said. "A lot of what you find depends
on whether you're looking."
Stepp also wanted to dispel the
misconception that students need to
work alone on CS assignments.
"There is a stereotype that we
don't want anyone to talk to anyone
and that computer science is isolated
and that you're not allowed to have
any contact with other people, and
you have to figure it out all by your
self with no help whatsoever," Stepp
said. "And I think that's a little bit un
fortunate because it's not true."

It's 11 p.m. Your program is
crashing, and the assignment is
due at midnight. You know where
your error is, but you don't know
how to fix it. A simple Google
search pulls up tons of working
code, but copying that directly
into your program would be vio
lating the Honor Code.
Yet it seems like there are al
ways some students who give in to
the temptation.
Stanford's Office of Communi
ty Standards' annual case reports
demonstrate a steady increase in
the number of Honor Code viola
tions in computer science (CS)
each year.
However, the enrollment in
CS classes has also risen signifi
cantly over the last five years. In
the 2013-14 academic year, over
1,500 students took CS 106A:
Programming Methodology, the
first course of the introductory
programming series in the CS
department, and computer sci
ence has grown into the largest
major on campus.
"Enrollments are on the
rise," said Mehran Sahami '92
M.S. '93 Ph.D. '99, professor of
computer science and associate
chair of education for the CS de
partment. "If you imagine the
same percentage of Honor Code
violations is taking place but now
the enrollment in the class is
twice what it used to be, you're
going to see twice as many viola
tions."

Moss: a measure of software
similarity
Few students realize that each
assignment they submit is run
through a program called Meas
ure of Software Similarity (Moss).
Moss is used to detect similarities
between code submissions, and is
considered a standard across
most U.S. institutions. Used by
computer science departments
worldwide, Moss was developed
by Stanford computer science
professor Alex Aiken.
Developed 20 years ago dur
ing Aiken's time as a professor at
UC-Berkeley, Moss is designed to
cut down the manual labor of
searching for plagiarism. Howev
er, Aiken emphasized that Moss is
not a system for detecting plagia
rism directly.
"What Moss detects is similar
ity," Aiken said. "Why the code is
similar is a human judgment that
has to be made."
Since code might be similar for
various reasons, including shared
libraries or starter code provided
for the course, an instructor much
check to see whether or not the
similarity returned by Moss con
stitutes plagiarism. Moss simply
helps professors determine which
programs should be flagged with
a higher priority for further re
view.
"It's kind of smart about what
'the same' means. It knows, for
example, that if you go through
and change all the variable
names, it doesn't matter," Aiken
said. "It knows some things about
programming that allow it to make
some judgments about when two
things are really the same and when
they're not."
Aiken explained that Stanford
uses Moss to compare submissions
not only against other students'
work in the class, but also against
code available online and submis
sions from previous years and quar
ters. The program looks for aspects
such as similar structure, identical
bugs and other unusual commonali
ties.
According to Stanford computer
science lecturer Julie Zelenski 'B9
M.S. '96, Moss also accounts for al
gorithms used by a significant num
ber of students.
"It also knows how to recognize
when something is just so idiomatic
that everyone did it the same way,"
Zelenski said.
Zelenski also explained that
since the introductory classes are so
large, a graduate student has been
hired to build tools to manage the lo
gistics of finding high-priority
matches in Moss for 106A and 1068
before passing the data on to the
course instructor.
Computer science lecturer
Marty Stepp also spoke about the
importance of having a teaching as
sistant (TA) to examine the Moss re
sults first.
"He does all of that part for us,
basically gets [the MOSS results] all
ready for us to look over, produces a
nice executive summary for us of the
data and places it in front of us in an
easy way for us to examine," Stepp
said. "We look over the top matches
and decide which ones are concern
ing to us, and that works really well
because he can help us have a faster
turnaround."
Stepp also emphasized that the
student does not play a role in decid
ing whether or not a case should be
pursued.
"The instructor should make
that decision so it's important to
note that his role has nothing to do
with innocence," Stepp said. "[The
TA] doesn't make that call for us. We
wouldn't ever farm that out to a
third party."
Stepp also explained that al
though the section leading program
plays a large role in grading assign
ments for students in 106A and
1068, section leaders are not re
sponsible for looking for plagiarism.
Instead, they are told to contact the
instructor if misconduct is suspect-

Ed, and according to Stepp, most of
the time section leaders do not have
the experience to accurately recog
nize an Honor Code violation.

Dealing with violations
If a violation is discovered, stu
dents usually have two options:
choosing the Early Resolution Op
tion (ERO) or allowingthe case to go
to a hearing.
When a case is brought to the Of
fice of Community Standards, a stu
dent is assigned a judicial officer to
advocate for the student. If the case
moves to trial and eventually a hear
ing, a panel of five students and one
faculty member determines
whether or not the student's actions
constitute a violation of the Honor
Code. If a student is found guilty by
a five-to-one vote, the panel assigns
a sanction to the student.
According to Stanford's Office of
Community Standards, standard
first-time sanctions are usually a
quarter of suspension and 40 hours
of community service unless the
panel finds that another response is
more appropriate.
First instituted in 2009, the ERO
gives students the opportunity to
immediately accept responsibility
for their actions and skip the judicial
hearing process. Zelenski explained
that the ERO gives students an in
centive to take responsibility for
their actions rather than lying to
avoid a sanction. In addition, while
hearings can take two months or
longer, the ERO can be resolved
within a few weeks.
"The vast majority of the stu
dents who I'm sending [to OCS] are
choosing to pursue an ERO alterna
tive [rather] than go to a full hear
ing," Zelenski said.
Even before sending a student to
the OCS, different instructors han
dle potential honor code violations

"Depending on the results they
get back [from Moss], some [in
structors] will just report them im
mediately without talking to the stu
dent. Some prefer to talk to the stu
dent," Sahami said. "We try to be
consistent with respect to how we
handle the Honor Code it's just a

Sahami himself asks to meet with

match.
"We have a conversation of what

and they shouldn't make up some

With the rising number of online
sources for code, instructors have
continued to investigate ways to dis
courage students from plagiarizing.
Stepp attributed his lack of Honor
Code cases to his slight alterations
to the assignments as a new lecturer.
Stepp has also added popups to
the class websites to caution stu
dents against plagiarism whenever
they download or submit an assign
ment. According to Stepp, research
has shown that reminders do in fact
affect the probability of a student's
choosing to cheat, especially if the
reminder comes before the student
starts an assignment.
"It's really hard to know what
factors have an impact and which

ones don't, but there has been edu
cational research that shows if you
remind students about these things
at key moments that it can make a
difference," Stepp said.
Jessie Duan 'l5, a student on the
Board of Judicial Affairs, spoke
about how the Board has been dis
cussing raising awareness about
Honor Code violations. One poten
tial effort includes talking to fresh
men about plagiarism.
"One thing we have been focus
ing on is raising awareness," Duan
said. "We've been talking about
reaching out to freshman dorms
more, making it more obvious from
the moment you get accepted into
Stanford [that] the Fundamental
Standard is this very important
thing."
Each computer science lecturer
and professor emphasized that the
department has gained a bad repu
tation for Honor Code violations
simply because it has the tools to
search for plagiarism.
"I think that it is true that com
puter science departments as a
whole tend to do more checking
than other departments," Aiken
said. "A lot of what you find depends
on whether you're looking."
Stepp also wanted to dispel the
misconception that students need to
work alone on CS assignments.
"There is a stereotype that we
don't want anyone to talk to anyone
and that computer science is isolated
and that you're not allowed to have
any contact with other people, and
you have to figure it out all by your
self with no help whatsoever," Stepp
said. "And I think that's a little bit un
fortunate because it's not true."
