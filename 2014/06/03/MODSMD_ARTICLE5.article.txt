Monday to discuss the conference
and the Iraqi Embassy's relation
ship with Stanford.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): Is this
your first trip to Stanford?
Lukman Faily (LF): This is my sec
ond trip to Stanford [on] previous
trips I had meetings with key people
who were involved in Iraq, such as
Dr. Condoleezza Rice, Secretary
Perry and a few others as well, some
of the researchers and so on. In addi
tion to that, j ust to get an under stand
ing of the archives of the documenta
tion of the Ba'ath Party that the
Hoover Institution holds and is pro
cessing, with digitalization and so on.
This conference is going to talk
about what took place and how we
can cooperate with each other, and to
give them an Iraqi perspective on
what was going on
TSD: So these are the only copies of
these documents available in the
world today?
LF: They are the only copies they
are actual live documents captured
at the head office of the Ba'ath Party
in Baghdad in 2003, and were
brought here to be understood,
archived, digitalized, and to gain a
better understanding how the
Ba'ath Party operated.
TSD: What is the focus of the confer
ence at the Hoover Institution Tues
day?
LF: It is primarily to talk about what
took place, what are the areas for co
operation and to explore the actual
history of Iraq in relation to the to
talitarian regimes. The documents

themselves provide a sample, a good
sample, of how systematic the op
pression and ruthlessness of Sad
dam [HusseinJ's rule was. I want to
get a feel of people who are interest
ed in Iraq, and I am also interested in
coming to Silicon Valley and having
discussions with major companies,
for example, how Google could work
with Iraq, how Qualcomm could, and
others as well.
TSD: What is your opinion of the
Hoover Institution in comparison to
other think tanks in D.C.?
LF: We know that you have a very
good archival process, and a good
historical understanding of that
dealing with the Cold War and other
things. We also know that you have a
good research base, which adds to
that. You also have a good archive li
brary. In addition to people, you have
the rich raw material as well. In that
sense, plus being a University, it
brings more impartiality and more
objectivity
TSD: Do you see yourself and the
Iraqi embassy having a continued
relationship with Stanford in the fu
ture?
LF: This is an objective of our trip, to
get a better understanding of this.
Earlier today, we had a meeting with
Secretary Chu [l]to just to get his
perspective on what the University
can offer, and we will have other dis
cussions. Later on today, I will have
one with the library, to see what
areas of cooperation exist now and
how we could get a better under
standing of what is taking place now,
as well as future cooperation.
Iraq does need partnership with
those who are with expertise, and
have a better understanding of what
took place. Americans, for less than
10 years now, have a good under
standing of the ruthlessness of Sad

dam Hussein, change has taken
place, democracy is in place, how do
we archive that, how do we learn
from it and how do we disseminate it
across research and academia as to
what took place. This is a small proj
ect, though it has two million docu
ments. It is comparatively small
compared to the archives in Iraq, but
it provides a good acid test.
TSD: Is the conference you are at
tending Tuesday an extension of
what you were on campus about in
February?
LF: The February one was just
about the discovery mode now we
are in the planning and action mode.
When I come to San Francisco, I usu
ally like to see not just the big issue,
but the other issues as well.
TSD: Given your technical back
ground, how has your experience
been at Stanford so far?
LF: I wish I was a student here
[laughs], I graduated from Man
chester in the United Kingdom. The
capabilities of the University, what it
can provide, and the desire for
knowledge to think out of the box
and providing for students' needs
and create the environment [the
University] would need to mentor
students, is a great one. I under
stand that there is a lot of coopera
tion with Silicon Valley, which is a
clear added value.
TSD: Any final remarks?
LF: Those who suffered under Sad
dam Hussein appreciate the oppor
tunity for change. Also, the regime
was unsustainablse for us to carry on
with. We realize that change was
necessary, and we appreciate the
United States for that.
