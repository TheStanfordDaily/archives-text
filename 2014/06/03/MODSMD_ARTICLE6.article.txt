## EDMAN SMASHES CARDINAL TO SUPER REGIONAL 
### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
There are certain moments
that simply cannot be described
with words.
Stanford's baseball team
was down to the final two outs
of its season late Monday night,
five hours and 50 minutes after
the first pitch against the Indi
ana Hoosiers thanks to a rain
delay that lasted nearly three
hours. Freshman Tommy
Edman stepped up to the left
handed batter's box with soph
omore Drew Jackson on second
for a possible tying run as the
Cardinal trailed 4-3.
On the first pitch he saw
from sophomore reliever Scott
Effross, Edman took the most
important swing of his life,
turning on an 86-mph inside
fastball and depositing it over
the right-field fence. The walk
off homer unleashed the Cardi
nal bench into a frenzy at home
plate, while Indiana's junior
catcher Kyle Schwarber froze
in a crouch in front of the cele
bration and senior right fielder
Will Nolden hung from the
fence in disbelief.
It was the San Diego, Cali
fornia native's first homer from
the left side of the plate in his
life, he said after the game, and
it secured a 5-4 victory for No. 3
Stanford (34-24) over No. 1 In
diana (44-15) in the final game
of the NCAA Bloomington Re
gional and a ticket to Nashville,
Tennessee to face Vanderbilt in
a Super Regional.
"That at-bat, I was just try
ing to get on base to be honest.
Home run was the last thing I
expected," Edman said. "I ex
pected the first pitch to be a
good pitch to hit because I knew
he didn't want to get behind

with a runner on second base. I
just went up there, trying to be
kind of aggressive, trying to
take a good swing at a good
pitch to hit, and got one right
there."
"[Realizing that it was a
walk-off] took us a second be
cause I think our lead-off hitter
just hit a home run," said fresh
man pitcher Cal Quantrill. "It

was wild. It was incredible. Got
us the win wow. I'm at a loss
for words. It was incredible."
Edman was named the
Bloomington Regional's Most
Outstanding Player after the
game for his offensive perform
ance a .417 batting average
(10-for-24) with four RBIs and
six runs scored as well as his
steady defense at shortstop,

which included a diving stop to
start a 6-4-3 double play in the
seventh inning on Sunday to
keep the Cardinal within strik
ing distance.
The shortstop's ninth-in
ning heroics were just the cul
mination of a long list of strong
performances that kept Stan
ford in the game against an In
diana team that prior to this
Sunday had gone 39-0 when
leading after seven innings.
Sophomore Logan James
got the start for the second con
secutive game, looking for re
demption after allowing four
runs over 1.2 innings on Sunday
against the Hoosiers. But it was
a similar story on Monday, as
James lasted just two-plus in-
