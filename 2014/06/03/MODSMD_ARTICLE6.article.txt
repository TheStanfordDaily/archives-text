## EDMAN SMASHES CARDINAL TO SUPER REGIONAL 
### JORDAN WALLACH DESK EDITOR 
There are certain moments
that simply cannot be described
with words.
Stanford's baseball team
was down to the final two outs
of its season late Monday night,
five hours and 50 minutes after
the first pitch against the Indi
ana Hoosiers thanks to a rain
delay that lasted nearly three
hours. Freshman Tommy
Edman stepped up to the left
handed batter's box with soph
omore Drew Jackson on second
for a possible tying run as the
Cardinal trailed 4-3.
On the first pitch he saw
from sophomore reliever Scott
Effross, Edman took the most
important swing of his life,
turning on an 86-mph inside
fastball and depositing it over
the right-field fence. The walk
off homer unleashed the Cardi
nal bench into a frenzy at home
plate, while Indiana's junior
catcher Kyle Schwarber froze
in a crouch in front of the cele
bration and senior right fielder
Will Nolden hung from the
fence in disbelief.
It was the San Diego, Cali
fornia native's first homer from
the left side of the plate in his
life, he said after the game, and
it secured a 5-4 victory for No. 3
Stanford (34-24) over No. 1 In
diana (44-15) in the final game
of the NCAA Bloomington Re
gional and a ticket to Nashville,
Tennessee to face Vanderbilt in
a Super Regional.
"That at-bat, I was just try
ing to get on base to be honest.
Home run was the last thing I
expected," Edman said. "I ex
pected the first pitch to be a
good pitch to hit because I knew
he didn't want to get behind

with a runner on second base. I
just went up there, trying to be
kind of aggressive, trying to
take a good swing at a good
pitch to hit, and got one right
there."
"[Realizing that it was a
walk-off] took us a second be
cause I think our lead-off hitter
just hit a home run," said fresh
man pitcher Cal Quantrill. "It

was wild. It was incredible. Got
us the win wow. I'm at a loss
for words. It was incredible."
Edman was named the
Bloomington Regional's Most
Outstanding Player after the
game for his offensive perform
ance a .417 batting average
(10-for-24) with four RBIs and
six runs scored as well as his
steady defense at shortstop,

which included a diving stop to
start a 6-4-3 double play in the
seventh inning on Sunday to
keep the Cardinal within strik
ing distance.
The shortstop's ninth-in
ning heroics were just the cul
mination of a long list of strong
performances that kept Stan
ford in the game against an In
diana team that prior to this
Sunday had gone 39-0 when
leading after seven innings.
Sophomore Logan James
got the start for the second con
secutive game, looking for re
demption after allowing four
runs over 1.2 innings on Sunday
against the Hoosiers. But it was
a similar story on Monday, as
James lasted just two-plus in-

nings and was charged for Indiana's
first two runs of the game. The
sophomore retired the side in order
in the first, but he surrendered a
run in the second after two walks
and a single, and was relieved after
walking the leadoff man in the third.
Sophomore Marcus Brakeman
was the Cardinal's unsung hero of
the game, as he allowed just one run
over 4.2 innings in relief in his sec
ond-longest outing of the season
he threw 5.2 scoreless innings on
April 23 against Saint Mary's. De
spite a two-hour, 51-minute rain
delay in the middle of the third in

ning, Brakeman waited it out and
then held the Hoosiers scoreless
from the fourth to the seventh in
nings.
"I was very pleased with Marcus
Brakeman, who came back and re
ally surprised us to come back after
the rain delay and pitch three or
four really strong innings," said
head coach Mark Marquess. "They
are a great team and they are tough
to stop."
After Indiana scored two in the
third to jump out to a 3-0 lead, Stan
ford answered in the bottom half of
the inning. The Cardinal's first two
hitters reached base in the frame, as
Edman led off with a single and sen
ior Danny Diekroeger was hit by a
pitch. RBI singles from senior Alex
Blandino, who hit .368 (7-for-19)
with five RBIs in the regional, and
sophomore Zach Hoffpauir nar
rowed the gap to 3-2.
From there, Stanford was held
scoreless until the sixth by Indiana
sophomore sidewinder Thomas
Belcher. The Hoosiers reliever
matched Brakeman frame by frame,
allowing just one run over 4.2 in
nings, also waiting out the rain delay
in between. But in the sixth, a coach
ing decision from Marquess paid big
dividends for the Cardinal.
For the second consecutive game,
the head coach pinch hit for freshman
left fielder Jack Klein on Sunday,
junior Wayne Taylor slammed a
three-run homer to give Stanford a 7-
6 lead that they held on to for the win.
On Monday, junior Dominic Jose was
given the pinch-hit duty and did not
disappoint. On a 2-1 count, Jose
launched a homer to right field. Jose
incited boos from the crowd at Bait
Kaufman Field by kissing his biceps
while crossing home plate. The blast
tied the game at 3-3 and kept the Car
dinal's Super Regional hopes alive.
Freshman Cal Quantrill took
over in relief in the seventh, just
three days after his one-run, com
plete game effort against Indiana
State. The Canadian, who is 3-0 with

a 0.83 ERA (3 ER/32.2 IP) and a 8.5
K/9 rate over his last four starts, pe
titioned Marquess to start before
Monday's game but was turned
down.
"Coach and I have a good working
relationship. We talked about it. We
knew what I had left. I was begging to
start, but they probably did the right
thing waiting on that," Quantrill said.
"Cal wanted to pitch. He wanted
to start. I said, 'You're not going to
start; if we have a chance to win it late
and you feel good,"' Marquess said.
"And he knows his arm. So I was real
proud of him."
Quantrill threw 2.1 innings in re
lief and earned the Regional-clinch
ing win after the Edman homer and

allowed one run unearned â€”on
four hits. The lone run came with two
outs in the top of the eighth, after an
error by Blandino followed by back
to-back singles plated the go-ahead
run.
But the walk-off homer sent the
Cardinal surging into Tennessee as
confident as they have been all sea
son after a rough first half in which
they started 11-16 before they fin
ished strong against a weaker sched
ule. Though Vanderbilt swept Stan
ford in their house at the beginning of
March, the 4-1, 5-1 and 4-2 final
scores of that series should give the
Cardinal some more confidence en
tering the best-of-three tourney on
Friday.

"The year has been really spe
cial because we've really struggled.
We were under .500 for over half the
year with a lot of young pitching, es
pecially, and some older position
players," Marquess said. "[l'm]
proud of everybody, because it's
been a difficult year for us ... And
the way we did it, it's very difficult
to win a Regional when you lose one
of those first two games and then
have a long day. We were just going
to try to mix-and-match and try to
get enough pitching to get by. So it's
a very special moment in our base
ball program."
