## Amma brings hugging spirit to campus 
### JENNA SHAPIRO 
Have you ever waited over an hour in
line for a hug?
Mata Amritanandamayi, better known
as "Amma" (or "Mother"), has devoted her
life to embracing the masses through her
global charities known as "Embracing the
World" and her magnetic message of love
and compassion. To be more specific,
Amma has physically hugged more than 33
million people.
Amma's reputation as India's "hugging

saint" and as one of the country's preemi
nent spiritual leaders explains why lines
stretched outside Memorial Auditorium be
fore her visit as people waited to embrace
her.
On June 2, 60-year-old Amma shared
her life experiences and insights with a
packed Memorial Auditorium during her
conversation with James Doty, the founder
and director of Stanford's Center for Com
passion and Altruism Research and Educa
tion (CCARE).
"The main issue is that we believe we're

limited," Amma said through her transla
tor. "If we think we're a battery, there's a
limited amount of time to be useful."
Instead, Amma attributes her energy
source to the "higher power and universal
energy" to which we're all connected. Al
though Amma is a Hindu leader, she said
that her religion is love.
"There are many kinds of powers in the
world military power, power of the writ
ten word, intellectual power," she said.
