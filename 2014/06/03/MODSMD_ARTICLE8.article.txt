## Amma brings hugging spirit to campus 
### JENNA SHAPIRO 
Have you ever waited over an hour in
line for a hug?
Mata Amritanandamayi, better known
as "Amma" (or "Mother"), has devoted her
life to embracing the masses through her
global charities known as "Embracing the
World" and her magnetic message of love
and compassion. To be more specific,
Amma has physically hugged more than 33
million people.
Amma's reputation as India's "hugging

saint" and as one of the country's preemi
nent spiritual leaders explains why lines
stretched outside Memorial Auditorium be
fore her visit as people waited to embrace
her.
On June 2, 60-year-old Amma shared
her life experiences and insights with a
packed Memorial Auditorium during her
conversation with James Doty, the founder
and director of Stanford's Center for Com
passion and Altruism Research and Educa
tion (CCARE).
"The main issue is that we believe we're

limited," Amma said through her transla
tor. "If we think we're a battery, there's a
limited amount of time to be useful."
Instead, Amma attributes her energy
source to the "higher power and universal
energy" to which we're all connected. Al
though Amma is a Hindu leader, she said
that her religion is love.
"There are many kinds of powers in the
world military power, power of the writ
ten word, intellectual power," she said.

Known as India's "hugging saint," Mata Amritanandamayi has traveled the world as part of her charity, Embracing the World,
which seeks to spread her message of love and compassion. To date, Amritanandamayi has hugged over 33 million people.
"We've tried and failed to bring
peace with these kind of powers. The
greatest power is the power of love."
With this deep belief in limitless
ness, Amma has powered Embrac
ing the World, a global network of
projects focused on improving food,
shelter, education, healthcare and
conditions for impoverished popula
tions in addition. The network also
provides aid during emergencies
and addresses environmental con
cerns. The vast majority of these ef
forts are conducted by volunteers
and unpaid administrators, includ
ing Amma herself, who does not ac
cept pay.
"This community really wants to
make the world a better place and
start with ourselves," said Amina
Janta, one of those volunteers who
was in attendance yesterday. "I bet
every last one of us is thinking 'I can
change the world.' She gives you that
self-confidence."
This determination and resonant
desire to change the world has clear
connections to our community at
Stanford. Through lunch conversa

tions and summers spent nose-deep
in research and the start-up culture,
one can see that students and profes
sors value this ideal of making a dif
ference.
Annie Anton 'l4, a graduating
psychology major and fellow at
CCARE, has her own vision for
change, one that is similarly rooted
in true compassion. Anton first
learned about Amma while doing
volunteer work in Kerala, India, but
she had already developed a convic
tion to give love.
"I went through a really hard
time in high school," Anton said. "I
dealt with anxiety and depression. I
thought, 'Who am I and what is my
purpose on this earth?' It was all
about me, how people would per
ceive me. All of a sudden, I saw the
falsity of these goals and realized if
other people are feeling this, I have
to help them. It expanded my heart
and made me want to help other peo
ple that might be feeling the same
way."
After graduation, Anton plans on
doing service in Ecuador for seven
months.
"I love that she's a hugging moth
er," Anton said of Amma. "I want to
embody that motherly energy as
well."
Amma's complete dedication to

others and her message of benevo
lence can be profoundly contagious.
Dante Sawyer, a member of
Amma's organization who has
worked with her since 2000, ex
pressed his personal experience
with this inspiration.
"In Amma, I've seen the full ca
pacity of a human being to give
themselves," he said. "Sometimes
you can think that the extent to
which she is giving is a bit extreme
her entire life dedicated to other
people but I think it's that ex
treme example that inspires other
people to think, while she's giving
100 percent, maybe I can give five
percent or 10 percent or a little bit
more than I've been giving."
In the aftermath of Doty's con
versation with Amma, a palpable
sense of compassion filled the audi
torium's space. People offered wide,
toothy smiles and considerately
cleared the walkways for each other.
"Compassion is the first step,"
Amma said. "If we take that first
step without fear, all else will follow
spontaneously. It's a chain reaction.
It starts to go from one person to the
next to the next, and it makes a huge
difference."
