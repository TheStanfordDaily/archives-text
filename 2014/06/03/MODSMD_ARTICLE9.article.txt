# STUDENT GROUPS
## SAL examines membership policies of VSOs 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
In response to the concern that some of Stanford's
Voluntary Student Organizations (VSOs) have be
come too selective, the offices of Student Activities
and Leadership (SAL), Residential Education, the
Haas Center and the Office of Religious Life brought
together a working group of staff in order to assess
the membership policies of student organizations.
"There were issues about selectivity and how hard
it is to join some groups," said Snehal Naik, assistant
dean and associate director of SAL. "We were having
some discussions and over time we have had concerns
and complaints to come to us around particular organ
izations that students are not able to join as a mem
ber."
In order to learn more about the problems stu
dents were experiencing, SAL administered a survey
via Qualtrics to a random sample of 1,500 undergrad
uates and 1,200 graduate students between Feb. 27
and March 7 earlier this year, asking questions about
the student organization community on campus, par
ticularly if organizations practice offering students
open and easy access to joining VSOs.
Of the random sampling, 491 undergraduates and
418 graduate students responded, a total 0f909 unique
responses.
Naik reported differences in the results of the sur
vey between the undergraduate and graduate student
populations, namely that 75 percent of undergradu
ates reported being involved in a registered student
organization compared to 60 percent of graduate stu
dents.
Additionally, the two groups of students provided
different reasons for difficulties in joining student or
ganizations. While graduate students mentioned hav
ing a hard time figuring how to join organizations or
even what organizations existed, undergraduates
found difficulties in joining for various other reasons.
"In a qualitative analysis of stu
dent comments, we found that 44
percent of undergraduates felt that
it was difficult to get involved in the
first place, 36 percent because of se
lectivity before joining the groups
particularly in pre-professional,
club sport or performing arts
groups —ll percent felt intimidat
ed to join and nine percent didn't
have time to join," Naik said.
SAL estimates that 20 to 30 per
cent of student groups require stu
dents to go through "strict applica
tion processes," asking for interviews,
resumes and transcripts, among
other things. However, the office does
not encourage this selectivity.
In an interview with The Daily
last year, Nanci Howe, associate
dean and director of SAL, said that
although some group's selective
procedures are acceptable, others
violate the mission of VSOs.
"The criteria for selecting mem
bers should be objective and is criti
cal to the operation of the group,"
Howe said. "For example, a cappella
groups have auditions and everyone
has the opportunity to audition. As
long as those auditions are open to

everyone and there is a fair and non
discriminatory process for choosing
who can participate and be selected,
then we would consider that within
the guidelines of objective criteria."
While SAL understands that
certain activities and the lack of par
ticular resources like one-on-one
mentoring opportunities might
limit the number of members that
organizations can take in, SAL
plans to work with student groups in
order to find the happy medium and
ensure that all students continue to
have open and easy access to stu
dent organizations.
Because the University is an ed
ucational institution, Naik said, stu
dent organizations should provide
students with learning opportuni
ties, as opposed to preventing them
from joining.
"More conversations will lead to
working with more groups how we
can best support the student leaders
and student organizations and the
students that are interested [in
those groups]," Naik said. "Some of
these practices may have been
going on for years and we could have
discussions with student organiza
tions to see how they can be more
broadly open to students that
demonstrate interest."
