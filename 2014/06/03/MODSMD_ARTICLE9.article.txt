## SAL examines membership policies of VSOs 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
In response to the concern that some of Stanford's
Voluntary Student Organizations (VSOs) have be
come too selective, the offices of Student Activities
and Leadership (SAL), Residential Education, the
Haas Center and the Office of Religious Life brought
together a working group of staff in order to assess
the membership policies of student organizations.
"There were issues about selectivity and how hard
it is to join some groups," said Snehal Naik, assistant
dean and associate director of SAL. "We were having
some discussions and over time we have had concerns
and complaints to come to us around particular organ
izations that students are not able to join as a mem
ber."
In order to learn more about the problems stu
dents were experiencing, SAL administered a survey
via Qualtrics to a random sample of 1,500 undergrad
uates and 1,200 graduate students between Feb. 27
and March 7 earlier this year, asking questions about
the student organization community on campus, par
ticularly if organizations practice offering students
open and easy access to joining VSOs.
Of the random sampling, 491 undergraduates and
418 graduate students responded, a total 0f909 unique
responses.
Naik reported differences in the results of the sur
vey between the undergraduate and graduate student
populations, namely that 75 percent of undergradu
ates reported being involved in a registered student
organization compared to 60 percent of graduate stu
dents.
Additionally, the two groups of students provided
different reasons for difficulties in joining student or
ganizations. While graduate students mentioned hav
ing a hard time figuring how to join organizations or
even what organizations existed, undergraduates
found difficulties in joining for various other reasons.
