## University proposes new Stanford in NYC program

Plans for a Stanford program in
New York City have continued to
take shape in recent weeks, punctu
ated by the University's submission
of a 115-page proposal to the New
York State Board of Education.
According to Sharon Palmer '9O,
associate vice provost of undergrad
uate education, the quarter-long
Stanford in New York City program
will be modelled after the popular
Bing Stanford in Washington pro
gram. Rather than focusing on poli
tics and policy, however, the New
York City program will emphasize
the arts, architecture, design and
urban studies.
"It will involve students in full
time internships, and they'll also be
taking classes in those fields, so
they'll have that same kind of expe
riential model as Stanford in Wash
ington," Palmer said.
John Barton, director of the Uni
versity's architecture program and

a member of the proposal's faculty
advisory committee, framed access
to New York City's unique environ
ment as well worth the administra
tive effort of establishing such a pro
gram.
"The opportunity to go to New
York and work in city planning as an
architecture major, or in a gallery as
a painter, or in a theater as a theater
major, and then have the course
work as well, would be a really pow
erful experience for students," Bar
ton said.
Palmer echoed Barton's senti
ments, adding that being in New
York City would allow Stanford stu
dents to take advantage of experi
ences that aren't offered on campus.
"New York provides unparal
leled cultural and art resources and
opportunities for internships and
activities in these fields that really
aren't available the same way on the
Stanford campus," she said.

Challenges moving forward
However, the proposal continues
to face concerns about its viability
and potential impact. Former New


NATALIE CHENG/The Stanford Daily
York City mayor Michael
Bloomberg, who supervised the
competition for an applied sciences
and engineering campus in New
York City for which Stanford initial
ly bid before withdrawing, ques
tioned the value of the proposed
program to the broader city.
"You've got to understand how
big the arts are in New York,"
Bloomberg said. "It's hard to
argue that another school that
wanted to have students visit mu
seums and take a course here and
there would have any measurable
impact on New York. I think the
only question you could have is
whether it would be good for Stan
ford students."
Meanwhile, Barton acknowl
edged the challenges presented by
finding students fulfilling intern
ships in the New York art scene.
"Typically, these positions don't
pay, but students also don't get
credit for them," Barton said, not
ing that such arrangements may
breach codes of ethics in fields like
architecture. "So we're trying to
find away to get students either
pay or credit."
Bloomberg argued that locating
the program in New York City
might actually pose disadvantages
for students due to the city's popu
larity.
"I do think that you might be
able to do the same thing else
where, and you might make the
case that [students] might be better
off in small towns, or even small
cities with small arts resources, just
because they'd be more important
and more valuable there,"
Bloomberg said. "In New York,
they may well get lost among all the
kids who want to work in this city."
Barton expressed confidence,
however, that Stanford would be
able to identify internships of the
quality expected by students.

"I think it's going to take a little
bit of time, and it's going to take
some development of assets," Bar
ton said. "We're going to find people
who are interested and then really
become partners over time,
whether they be galleries or theater
programs or museums."
Barton cited other challenges
including integrating disciplinary
diversity into the students' experi
ence in New York, identifying hous
ing for students and dealing with
New York state laws that regulate
school openings within the state
as being more pertinent.
"We're still struggling with the
balance between the coursework
time, the internship time, and the
time [students] are spending most
ly with people of similar disciplines
and how much time they have to
spend together across disciplines,"
Barton explained.
Barton framed the challenge of
ensuring disciplinary diversity as
more accentuated than at Stanford
in Washington, which he described
as offering more naturally cross
disciplinary internships and
coursework.
While administrators empha
sized the value of the proposed pro
gram in terms of expanding the op
portunities available to students,
Bloomberg described the benefits
of the initiative as much more limit
ed than those that would have been
offered by the comprehensive cam
pus Stanford had previously
sought.
"I thought Stanford made a mis
take in the engineering situation
because it could have been a branch
for Stanford that would be substan
tive and would give their faculty in
[Silicon Valley] a chance to go back
and forth," Bloomberg said. "The
engineering school was sending
students here for three years. It
brought a lot of great faculty, it was
great for New York City, and I think
it would have been great for Stan
ford."
