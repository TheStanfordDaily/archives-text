Plans for a Stanford program in
New York City have continued to
take shape in recent weeks, punctu
ated by the University's submission
of a 115-page proposal to the New
York State Board of Education.
According to Sharon Palmer '9O,
associate vice provost of undergrad
uate education, the quarter-long
Stanford in New York City program
will be modelled after the popular
Bing Stanford in Washington pro
gram. Rather than focusing on poli
tics and policy, however, the New
York City program will emphasize
the arts, architecture, design and
urban studies.
"It will involve students in full
time internships, and they'll also be
taking classes in those fields, so
they'll have that same kind of expe
riential model as Stanford in Wash
ington," Palmer said.
John Barton, director of the Uni
versity's architecture program and

a member of the proposal's faculty
advisory committee, framed access
to New York City's unique environ
ment as well worth the administra
tive effort of establishing such a pro
gram.
"The opportunity to go to New
York and work in city planning as an
architecture major, or in a gallery as
a painter, or in a theater as a theater
major, and then have the course
work as well, would be a really pow
erful experience for students," Bar
ton said.
Palmer echoed Barton's senti
ments, adding that being in New
York City would allow Stanford stu
dents to take advantage of experi
ences that aren't offered on campus.
"New York provides unparal
leled cultural and art resources and
opportunities for internships and
activities in these fields that really
aren't available the same way on the
Stanford campus," she said.

Challenges moving forward
However, the proposal continues
to face concerns about its viability
and potential impact. Former New
