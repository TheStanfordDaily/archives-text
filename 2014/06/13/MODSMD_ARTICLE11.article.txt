John Arrillaga '6O made a sur
prise visit at the grand opening of the
new Arrillaga Outdoor Education
and Recreation Center (AOERC)
on Nov. 1.
The 75,000-square-foot center,
located just west of Roble Field on
Santa Teresa Street, features a
well-lit rock climbing room de
signed for rope climbing and boul
dering, multipurpose fitness stu
dios and a 50-meter swimming pool
complete with a handicap ramp.
The project, which was original
ly slated for completion in January
2014, was mainly funded by the Ar
rillaga family and Avery family.
"This is for the students and the
faculty and all the staff and all
those that work at Stanford," Arril
laga said during his grand-opening
speech. "We love doing it, and I
hope to continue to do it."
Ray Purpur, deputy athletic di
rector, explained that compared to
other gyms on campus, where varsi
ty teams may book space for prac
tices, the new center is geared to
wards campus recreation for stu
dents, staff and faculty.
According to Marion Avery, who
together with Arrillaga cut the rib
bon during the opening ceremony,
meeting students' need was a driv
ing force behind the project.
"I like the fact that John [Arrilla
ga] said when he was planning this
that, as far as the activities inside,
he wanted to wait and see what the

students wanted, and that was one
big priority," Avery said.
The 50-meter Avery Recreation
al Pool for instructional and recre
ational use the only one on cam
pus with a handicap ramp according
to Purpur is an example of how
the new facility attends to student
demand.
"The Avery Aquatic Center pool
is so crowded all day long and into
the evening," Avery said. "This will
be an opportunity for this west side
of campus to have a place for both a
gym and for swimming."
Another such example is the

rock climbing room.
Kevin Hopper, coordinator for
indoor climbing events and facili
ties, said that he has extra staffers
on hand for the climbing room for
the first few weeks as he anticipates
a big crowd.
"We have a large climbing com
munity to begin with, but I'm sure
there's going to be a lot of energy
around the new building," Hopper
said.
Ellie Redding 'l6, who was a
Stanford Pre-Orientation Trip
(SPOT) leader this year and is still
involved in the SPOT community,

was impressed with the new climb
ing room.
"I love how much space there is
especially with the climbing wall,"
Redding said. "After coming from
the last one, it was nice but it was
very cramped and now we have tons
of space it's a lot taller every
thing is much more open." Beat
rice Garrard 'l6, who is also involved
in SPOT and general outdoor educa
tion community, said she was im
pressed with the center's facilities.
"It's wonderful to see more at
tention paid to the outdoor educa
tion program," Garrard added.

Advertising for the grand open
ing was kept limited due to final
touch-ups such as making sure all
the ID scanning systems were in
order, Purpur said.
"We wanted kind of a gradual
grand opening but we think we will
be busy soon," he added.
While the center is now official
ly open to all, details such as setting
up volleyball and badminton nets
will happen over time depending on
student demand, Purpur added.

The Arrillaga Outdoor Education and Recreation Center, located west of Roble Field on Santa Teresa Street, opened on Nov. 1. The 75,000-square
foot center, featuring an extensive rock climbing wall and multipurpose fitness rooms, was funded mainly by the Arrillaga and Avery families.
