## Stanford lags behind in becoming smoke-free

While numerous college and university
campuses across the nation have become
smoke-free, Stanford has only recently asked
campus vendors to stop selling tobacco prod
ucts on campus, a change that will be effective
beginning March 1.
However, some advocates believe that the
University did not take the lead in the efforts
towards a smoke-free campus.
The University lagging behind
Last year, Kelly Young-Wolff, a postdoctor
al research fellow of heart disease prevention
at the Stanford Center for Research in Disease
Prevention, along with Keith Humphreys,
Stanford professor of psychiatry, started a
grassroots initiative to raise awareness about
smoking and tobacco-use on campus. They had
hoped to get a stricter policy since 2009, a pos
sibility that hadn't received attention until re
cently.
"When it really comes to making a change
in policy, it's been pretty challenging," Young-
Wolff said.
"We're still trying to figure out how to nav
igate the system to know who to approach
next, who ultimately gets to make the decision
and what information we should have ready to
make a clear argument that this policy has im
portant health implications and is not just
symbolic," she added.
But the team showed no signs of letting up.
Though not officially sponsored, the initiative
has been seeking support from other Stanford
students, faculty and staff since April last
year.
In the few presentations Young-Wolff gave,
she said some people were still surprised by
how different Stanford's smoking policy was
relative to that of other campuses.
As of Jan. 2, 2014, 1,182 colleges and uni
versities were 100 percent smoke-free, ac
cording to a report by the American Non

smokers' Rights Foundation. Of these, 811 are
completely tobacco-free.
More shocking to advocates and their sup
porters, however, was the continued sale of to
bacco on campus.
In California, Stanford remains one of the
last of higher-level schools in the state that
continues to sell tobacco products. Currently,
cigarettes can be purchased either at the
Valero gas station along Serra Street or at
Tresidder Express in the main Stanford cam
pus.
This is uncommon in 2014, according to
Robert Jackler, professor at the Stanford
School of Medicine and researcher on the haz
ards of tobacco.
Philip Pizzo, who led the School of Medi
cine in going smoke-free in 2007 when he was
dean, said he would "very much like to see
Stanford University be a completely smoke
free campus."
"I recognize that it's a decision that needs
other champions, be they students or faculty
or leaders, and ultimately the leadership of
the University as well," Pizzo said.
Attempted student initiatives
Not including the recent effort led by
Young-Wolff and Humphreys, two different
student-led efforts have pushed for a smoke
free campus in the past and failed.
Jamie Tam 'lO spearheaded one of the
smoke-free Stanford campaigns when she was
president of Stanford Colleges Against Can
cer (SCAC) between 2006 and 2010.
In 2009, Tam and other members of SCAC
released a petition asking for a stricter smoke
free policy that would ban the sale of tobacco
on campus, push for smoking cessation pro
grams for students and prohibit smoking on
campus, except in a few sufficiently remote
places.
It was the last of these three components
that drew major opposition.
"There was incredible misunderstanding of
what we were asking people to support," said
