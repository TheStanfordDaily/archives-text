## LETTER FROM THE EDITOR George Chen Editor's Farewell: Admitting our faults 
### 
I'll never forget how I stumbled
into the Daily office for the first
time. I was a wide-eyed fresh
man trying to find my way to Daily
101 X, The Daily's freshman orienta
tion, and I was lost it turns out
"behind Old Union" isn't a useful di
rection for a freshman who has no
clue where Old Union is. First I was
at Tresidder, then Axe and Palm,
then some room on the second floor
of Old Union. I almost called it quits,
almost deciding that maybe this was
a sign that I shouldn't join The Daily.
I persevered, though, and a few min
utes later I found the two-story
building on Panama Mall.
Not giving up during those few
minutes was the best decision I've
made at Stanford. It's difficult to
comprehend how my journey at The
Daily started three years ago, when
I was crammed into the newsroom
upstairs with 106 other freshmen at
Daily 101 X, and it's even harder to
comprehend how The Daily eventu
ally became my home. In my time at
The Daily, I've written, edited, inter
viewed, listened and talked. But
most importantly, I've learned.
I've learned from David, whose
dedication to covering or living,
more accurately Softball is incom
parable. I've learned from Winston,
who avidly talks about The Daily's
future at all times and all places, but
especially downstairs at the office.
I've learned from Jana, who I'm con
vinced is one of the brightest minds
to walk through The Daily's doors
and will undoubtedly do us proud as
Volume 246 editor in chief. I've
learned from Catherine and Do, who
on top of putting in 40 hours per
week as managing editors, take 20-
plus units each quarter and run on at
most two hours of sleep each day. I've
learned from Joey and Sam, who
both took me along the greatest ad
venture of my life while still manag
ing not to leave the office also
known as writing "Rags to Roses:
The Rise of Stanford Football." And
I've learned from my good friend and
Volume 244 editor-in-chief Ed, who

taught me that working at The Daily
is much more than putting out a
paper every day.
So thank you, Stanford Daily.
Before I pass the baton off to
Jana, I have a few parting words on
one last lesson that I've learned
through the Daily lens.
I believe that our student body
cares about the Stanford community
greatly, but too often we're late and
too often we're afraid to admit that
we're at least partially responsible
for the community's problems. As Ed
recognized the other day, Stanford
students sometimes point fingers at
the University administration'without
understanding the full context sur
rounding an issue or without realizing
that they themselves could've done
better. We're not very good at admit
ting our own mistakes.
We shouldn't blame R&DE for
Ike's leaving just because R&DE is
a convenient scapegoat after last
year's Suites protests. Arguing that
the University failed to accurately
assess students' wants is one matter,
but we shouldn't jump to conclusions
that R&DE had any wrongdoing.
We shouldn't ask administrators
to admit and fix their mistakes while
not admitting and fixing ours first.
Hundreds of students converged at
White Plaza last week to stand with
Leah and demand changes to Stan
ford's sexual assault policies —it
was admirable and important that
they did. Many of the student-voiced
criticisms in the widely distributed
emails and at the rally were focused
on the failure of the Alternative Re
view Process (ARP) in adjudicating
sexual assault cases. But how many
students thought to play an active
role when changes to the ARP were
under discussion just two years ago?
Shouldn't the student body be at least
partially responsible since those
changes to the ARP the same
changes that students are now criticiz
ing —had to be passed by the ASSU
Senate and Graduate Student Council,
