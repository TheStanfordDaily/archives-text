## Admission rates and why we're here

I don't even know how people get
into Stanford anymore.
This is an honest sentiment. The
first thing people told us during
freshmen orientation was that we
were not mistakes: that we had been
admitted to this exclusive club be
cause we deserved to be there. It was
very self-affirming. I enjoyed it. It
made me feel good.
And yet that sentiment, while
true, doesn't tell the whole truth. We
got into Stanford because we de
served to be there? Sure, I won't dis
agree with that. I see people do great
things constantly. You know all the
stones of success; most true, a few
perhaps contrived.
The fact of the matter is: we de
served to get in here, but most people
who got rejected did too.

Is it a little silly to think of Stan
ford in terms of numbers? We're not a
data set. And yet here's a few impor
tant numbers for you to consider: The
incoming freshmen of the 20134 year
had a 25-75 percentile spread on the
SAT of 2070-2350. But in the 2006-7
school year the year after the SAT
added the writing section the
spread was 2000-2300. And this in
crease has been fairly recent: Only
five years ago the spread was still
2010-2300.
What do these numbers tell you?
We can say that the students are per
forming better on standardized tests,
and though many criticisms of the
SAT are justified, the test is still bet
ter than no test at all. For those of you
who believe that we students deserve
to be here, these numbers should
make you feel a lot better. The idea of
"deserving" is nebulous, and justifi
ably so, but if our test scores are
trending up, at the very least it looks
like we are changing the definition of
what "deserving" means.
But why is this happening? Let's
look at that change in a different way.
As we've all heard, admissions rates
are consistently declining. The gradu
ating class of 2014 had an admission
rate of 7.2 percent. Since then the
rates have been 7.1, 6.6,5.7 and now
5.07. That last figure is the lowest in
the country.

These are all small percentages, of
course. But an admissions rate of 7.2
percent translates to one out of 14.
5.07 percent means one out of 20. Just
by going back to the class of 2015, in
two years the selectivity of Stanford
has increased by a third.
But while our students are im
proving on standardized tests, these
rates are primarily because of an
ever-expanding applicant pool. Over
the same timeframe of the listed
admit rates, Stanford's applicant pool
was approximately 32,000, 34,000,
37,000,39,000 and now 42,000. At the
same time, we know that the vast ma
jority of applicants are qualified to at
tend Stanford, or any of its peers for
that matter. (Harvard quotes the fig
ure at 80 percent, for example.) Col
lege admissions have always been a
buyer's market, but recent trends
show that this tendency is increasing.
These results present an oxy
moron. The first point is that if you
can pick from a bigger pool you'll get
higher scores and theoretically
more qualified admits. The second is
that a lot of people who Stanford
would have considered perfectly good
candidates in the past are now being
rejected. The admissions pool is not
being inflated by long shots who add
Stanford on the Common Application
for the hell of it. The pool is good and
it's getting better. We're still rejecting
valedictorians and team captains and
future presidents and Nobel laure
ates. We're simply rejecting more of
them.

Stanford's rapidly increasing ap
plicant pools are not an isolated expe
rience: they represent larger trends
in college admissions. More people
are applying to Stanford than ever be
fore, and while it's tempting to say
that these applicants are because of
the increased visibility of the Univer
sity— for example, Stanford has an
elite football team while the Ivy
League schools don't that thesis is
