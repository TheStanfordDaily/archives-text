## Admission rates and why we're here

I don't even know how people get
into Stanford anymore.
This is an honest sentiment. The
first thing people told us during
freshmen orientation was that we
were not mistakes: that we had been
admitted to this exclusive club be
cause we deserved to be there. It was
very self-affirming. I enjoyed it. It
made me feel good.
And yet that sentiment, while
true, doesn't tell the whole truth. We
got into Stanford because we de
served to be there? Sure, I won't dis
agree with that. I see people do great
things constantly. You know all the
stones of success; most true, a few
perhaps contrived.
The fact of the matter is: we de
served to get in here, but most people
who got rejected did too.

Is it a little silly to think of Stan
ford in terms of numbers? We're not a
data set. And yet here's a few impor
tant numbers for you to consider: The
incoming freshmen of the 20134 year
had a 25-75 percentile spread on the
SAT of 2070-2350. But in the 2006-7
school year the year after the SAT
added the writing section the
spread was 2000-2300. And this in
crease has been fairly recent: Only
five years ago the spread was still
2010-2300.
What do these numbers tell you?
We can say that the students are per
forming better on standardized tests,
and though many criticisms of the
SAT are justified, the test is still bet
ter than no test at all. For those of you
who believe that we students deserve
to be here, these numbers should
make you feel a lot better. The idea of
"deserving" is nebulous, and justifi
ably so, but if our test scores are
trending up, at the very least it looks
like we are changing the definition of
what "deserving" means.
But why is this happening? Let's
look at that change in a different way.
As we've all heard, admissions rates
are consistently declining. The gradu
ating class of 2014 had an admission
rate of 7.2 percent. Since then the
rates have been 7.1, 6.6,5.7 and now
5.07. That last figure is the lowest in
the country.

These are all small percentages, of
course. But an admissions rate of 7.2
percent translates to one out of 14.
5.07 percent means one out of 20. Just
by going back to the class of 2015, in
two years the selectivity of Stanford
has increased by a third.
But while our students are im
proving on standardized tests, these
rates are primarily because of an
ever-expanding applicant pool. Over
the same timeframe of the listed
admit rates, Stanford's applicant pool
was approximately 32,000, 34,000,
37,000,39,000 and now 42,000. At the
same time, we know that the vast ma
jority of applicants are qualified to at
tend Stanford, or any of its peers for
that matter. (Harvard quotes the fig
ure at 80 percent, for example.) Col
lege admissions have always been a
buyer's market, but recent trends
show that this tendency is increasing.
These results present an oxy
moron. The first point is that if you
can pick from a bigger pool you'll get
higher scores and theoretically
more qualified admits. The second is
that a lot of people who Stanford
would have considered perfectly good
candidates in the past are now being
rejected. The admissions pool is not
being inflated by long shots who add
Stanford on the Common Application
for the hell of it. The pool is good and
it's getting better. We're still rejecting
valedictorians and team captains and
future presidents and Nobel laure
ates. We're simply rejecting more of
them.

Stanford's rapidly increasing ap
plicant pools are not an isolated expe
rience: they represent larger trends
in college admissions. More people
are applying to Stanford than ever be
fore, and while it's tempting to say
that these applicants are because of
the increased visibility of the Univer
sity— for example, Stanford has an
elite football team while the Ivy
League schools don't that thesis is

simply not true. Admissions rates
have been declining across the board.
And asking whether Stanford has
anything to distinguish itself from its
peers raises the question of whether
Stanford has anything to distinguish
itself at all.
Criticisms of college generally fall
into two categories. The first that
of people like Malcolm Gladwell is
that a top-flight education doesn't re
ally help: that a person who is admit
ted to both Penn State and UPenn
will do just as well in life if he attends
either school. The second —which is
more of a corollary than a separate
critique is that of Peter Thiel, who
famously contended on Stanford's
campus that the only actual selling
point of Stanford is its exclusivity.
And it naturally follows that if the
basic underlying premise of universi
ty exclusivity that schools like
Stanford make the exclusive differ
ent from the excluded —is false,
then the exclusivity of schools like
Stanford is bound to collapse.
So the question is: What is the
point of Stanford?
I won't try to defend Stanford in
terms of its actual education right
now. To be clear, I firmly believe that the
opportunities Stanford has given me
are difficult if not impossible to repli
cate. I love this University, and if I had
thechancetodoitall over again, I would
attend Stanford all the same. But I don't
have any firsthand experience of the ed
ucational opportunities available at
other schools. I can't defend my belief
as rigorously as I would like.
But we can see that the expanding
applicant pools at schools like Stan
ford belie the growing national and in
ternational stature of these schools.
Improving transportation, communi
cation and financial aid resources at
Stanford and its peers are slowly
eroding the regional nature of higher
education, in the same way that a few
colleges are creating a national con
sensus on what school is the "best."
This is not to say that undergradu
ate admissions are not completely na
tional: While admit yield (the percent
age of admitted students who eventu
ally matriculate at the school) is nor
mally dominated by the national
schools you would expect, a list of
high-yield schools still features many
flagship state universities, such as
Alaska-Fairbanks and Nebraska. But
despite the continued prominence of
regional schools, the portability of a

Stanford degree is more apparent
than ever.

Does portability transcend utility?
I would like to think so: Moreover, I
would like to think that a Stanford de
gree will open any door and get me
any job. But a constantly looming
sense of uncertainty seems to hang
over every student in the humanities,
and many students in the less mar
ketable STEM fields too. As a human
ities student, I think that feeling's
mostly angst. But if it's angst, it's
angst that the rest of the country feels
as well.

Universities are improving their
infrastructure in attempts to market
themselves to a student body that is
theoretically more and more choosy.
Stanford is constantly renovating;
Harvard is pouring a small fortune
into effectively rebuilding its aging
Houses; Yale's undergraduate col
leges are undergoing similarly neces
sary upgrades; Chicago's marketing
efforts are a story in and of them
selves. As students, we are constantly
tempted to tell ourselves that we are
special and, unlike all others, deserve
to be here and every dollar spent in
the arms race between great colleges
seemingly reaffirms that sentiment.
Universities have excellent rea
sons to care more and more about
marketing; consider cross-admit
yields and the graduate student com
munity, each of which deserves an
essay all to itself. But these distant
struggles are mostly unseen by us un
dergraduates, and they do not reflect
what happens in our daily lives. As
soon as we step onto this campus as
students of this University, what af
fects our lives is not the admissions of
fice but the world that that office
opened to us.
What we inevitably see in our own
personal experiences is not affirma
tion of our status at Stanford so much
as a lesson that we are lucky to be here
moreover, a reminder that we need
the University more than it needs us.
We deserved to get in here, but most
people who got rejected did too. But
the flip side of that truth is that Stan
ford could toss out its first batch of ad
mits, pick a new group, toss that one
out as well, repeat the process four or
five times, and still be the great uni
versity that it is today.
What is left to us, then, is to take
advantage ofwhatwe have been so ut
terly fortunate to gain. My congratu
lations to the Class of 2018: There's a
big world within Campus Drive, and
now it's your privilege to be here.

valedictorians and team captains and
future presidents and Nobel laure
ates. We're simply rejecting more of
them.

Stanford's rapidly increasing ap
plicant pools are not an isolated expe
rience: they represent larger trends
in college admissions. More people
are applying to Stanford than ever be
fore, and while it's tempting to say
that these applicants are because of
the increased visibility of the Univer
sity— for example, Stanford has an
elite football team while the Ivy
League schools don't that thesis is

simply not true. Admissions rates
have been declining across the board.
And asking whether Stanford has
anything to distinguish itself from its
peers raises the question of whether
Stanford has anything to distinguish
itself at all.
Criticisms of college generally fall
into two categories. The first that
of people like Malcolm Gladwell is
that a top-flight education doesn't re
ally help: that a person who is admit
ted to both Penn State and UPenn
will do just as well in life if he attends
either school. The second —which is
more of a corollary than a separate
critique is that of Peter Thiel, who
famously contended on Stanford's
campus that the only actual selling
point of Stanford is its exclusivity.
And it naturally follows that if the
basic underlying premise of universi
ty exclusivity that schools like
Stanford make the exclusive differ
ent from the excluded —is false,
then the exclusivity of schools like
Stanford is bound to collapse.
So the question is: What is the
point of Stanford?
I won't try to defend Stanford in
terms of its actual education right
now. To be clear, I firmly believe that the
opportunities Stanford has given me
are difficult if not impossible to repli
cate. I love this University, and if I had
thechancetodoitall over again, I would
attend Stanford all the same. But I don't
have any firsthand experience of the ed
ucational opportunities available at
other schools. I can't defend my belief
as rigorously as I would like.
But we can see that the expanding
applicant pools at schools like Stan
ford belie the growing national and in
ternational stature of these schools.
Improving transportation, communi
cation and financial aid resources at
Stanford and its peers are slowly
eroding the regional nature of higher
education, in the same way that a few
colleges are creating a national con
sensus on what school is the "best."
This is not to say that undergradu
ate admissions are not completely na
tional: While admit yield (the percent
age of admitted students who eventu
ally matriculate at the school) is nor
mally dominated by the national
schools you would expect, a list of
high-yield schools still features many
flagship state universities, such as
Alaska-Fairbanks and Nebraska. But
despite the continued prominence of
regional schools, the portability of a

Stanford degree is more apparent
than ever.

Does portability transcend utility?
I would like to think so: Moreover, I
would like to think that a Stanford de
gree will open any door and get me
any job. But a constantly looming
sense of uncertainty seems to hang
over every student in the humanities,
and many students in the less mar
ketable STEM fields too. As a human
ities student, I think that feeling's
mostly angst. But if it's angst, it's
angst that the rest of the country feels
as well.

Universities are improving their
infrastructure in attempts to market
themselves to a student body that is
theoretically more and more choosy.
Stanford is constantly renovating;
Harvard is pouring a small fortune
into effectively rebuilding its aging
Houses; Yale's undergraduate col
leges are undergoing similarly neces
sary upgrades; Chicago's marketing
efforts are a story in and of them
selves. As students, we are constantly
tempted to tell ourselves that we are
special and, unlike all others, deserve
to be here and every dollar spent in
the arms race between great colleges
seemingly reaffirms that sentiment.
Universities have excellent rea
sons to care more and more about
marketing; consider cross-admit
yields and the graduate student com
munity, each of which deserves an
essay all to itself. But these distant
struggles are mostly unseen by us un
dergraduates, and they do not reflect
what happens in our daily lives. As
soon as we step onto this campus as
students of this University, what af
fects our lives is not the admissions of
fice but the world that that office
opened to us.
What we inevitably see in our own
personal experiences is not affirma
tion of our status at Stanford so much
as a lesson that we are lucky to be here
moreover, a reminder that we need
the University more than it needs us.
We deserved to get in here, but most
people who got rejected did too. But
the flip side of that truth is that Stan
ford could toss out its first batch of ad
mits, pick a new group, toss that one
out as well, repeat the process four or
five times, and still be the great uni
versity that it is today.
What is left to us, then, is to take
advantage ofwhatwe have been so ut
terly fortunate to gain. My congratu
lations to the Class of 2018: There's a
big world within Campus Drive, and
now it's your privilege to be here.

I don't even know how people get
into Stanford anymore.
This is an honest sentiment. The
first thing people told us during
freshmen orientation was that we
were not mistakes: that we had been
admitted to this exclusive club be
cause we deserved to be there. It was
very self-affirming. I enjoyed it. It
made me feel good.
And yet that sentiment, while
true, doesn't tell the whole truth. We
got into Stanford because we de
served to be there? Sure, I won't dis
agree with that. I see people do great
things constantly. You know all the
stones of success; most true, a few
perhaps contrived.
The fact of the matter is: we de
served to get in here, but most people
who got rejected did too.
♦ ♦♦
Is it a little silly to think of Stan
ford in terms of numbers? We're not a
data set. And yet here's a few impor
tant numbers for you to consider: The
incoming freshmen of the 20134 year
had a 25-75 percentile spread on the
SAT of 2070-2350. But in the 2006-7
school year the year after the SAT
added the writing section the
spread was 2000-2300. And this in
crease has been fairly recent: Only
five years ago the spread was still
2010-2300.
What do these numbers tell you?
We can say that the students are per
forming better on standardized tests,
and though many criticisms of the
SAT are justified, the test is still bet
ter than no test at all. For those of you
who believe that we students deserve
to be here, these numbers should
make you feel a lot better. The idea of
"deserving" is nebulous, and justifi
ably so, but if our test scores are
trending up, at the very least it looks
like we are changing the definition of
what "deserving" means.
But why is this happening? Let's
look at that change in a different way.
As we've all heard, admissions rates
are consistently declining. The gradu
ating class of 2014 had an admission
rate of 7.2 percent. Since then the
rates have been 7.1, 6.6,5.7 and now
5.07. That last figure is the lowest in
the country.

These are all small percentages, of
course. But an admissions rate of 7.2
percent translates to one out of 14.
5.07 percent means one out of 20. Just
by going back to the class of 2015, in
two years the selectivity of Stanford
has increased by a third.
But while our students are im
proving on standardized tests, these
rates are primarily because of an
ever-expanding applicant pool. Over
the same timeframe of the listed
admit rates, Stanford's applicant pool
was approximately 32,000, 34,000,
37,000,39,000 and now 42,000. At the
same time, we know that the vast ma
jority of applicants are qualified to at
tend Stanford, or any of its peers for
that matter. (Harvard quotes the fig
ure at 80 percent, for example.) Col
lege admissions have always been a
buyer's market, but recent trends
show that this tendency is increasing.
These results present an oxy
moron. The first point is that if you
can pick from a bigger pool you'll get
higher scores and theoretically
more qualified admits. The second is
that a lot of people who Stanford
would have considered perfectly good
candidates in the past are now being
rejected. The admissions pool is not
being inflated by long shots who add
Stanford on the Common Application
for the hell of it. The pool is good and
it's getting better. We're still rejecting
valedictorians and team captains and
future presidents and Nobel laure
ates. We're simply rejecting more of
them.

Stanford's rapidly increasing ap
plicant pools are not an isolated expe

I don't even know how people get
into Stanford anymore.
This is an honest sentiment. The
first thing people told us during
freshmen orientation was that we
were not mistakes: that we had been
admitted to this exclusive club be
cause we deserved to be there. It was
very self-affirming. I enjoyed it. It
made me feel good.
And yet that sentiment, while
true, doesn't tell the whole truth. We
got into Stanford because we de
served to be there? Sure, I won't dis
agree with that. I see people do great
things constantly. You know all the
stones of success; most true, a few
perhaps contrived.
The fact of the matter is: we de
served to get in here, but most people
who got rejected did too.

Is it a little silly to think of Stan
ford in terms of numbers? We're not a
data set. And yet here's a few impor
tant numbers for you to consider: The
incoming freshmen of the 20134 year
had a 25-75 percentile spread on the
SAT of 2070-2350. But in the 2006-7
school year the year after the SAT
added the writing section the
spread was 2000-2300. And this in
crease has been fairly recent: Only
five years ago the spread was still
2010-2300.
What do these numbers tell you?
We can say that the students are per
forming better on standardized tests,
and though many criticisms of the
SAT are justified, the test is still bet
ter than no test at all. For those of you
who believe that we students deserve
to be here, these numbers should
make you feel a lot better. The idea of
"deserving" is nebulous, and justifi
ably so, but if our test scores are
trending up, at the very least it looks
like we are changing the definition of
what "deserving" means.
But why is this happening? Let's
look at that change in a different way.
As we've all heard, admissions rates
are consistently declining. The gradu
ating class of 2014 had an admission
rate of 7.2 percent. Since then the
rates have been 7.1, 6.6,5.7 and now
5.07. That last figure is the lowest in
the country.

These are all small percentages, of
course. But an admissions rate of 7.2
percent translates to one out of 14.
5.07 percent means one out of 20. Just
by going back to the class of 2015, in
two years the selectivity of Stanford
has increased by a third.
But while our students are im
proving on standardized tests, these
rates are primarily because of an
ever-expanding applicant pool. Over
the same timeframe of the listed
admit rates, Stanford's applicant pool
was approximately 32,000, 34,000,
37,000,39,000 and now 42,000. At the
same time, we know that the vast ma
jority of applicants are qualified to at
tend Stanford, or any of its peers for
that matter. (Harvard quotes the fig
ure at 80 percent, for example.) Col
lege admissions have always been a
buyer's market, but recent trends
show that this tendency is increasing.
These results present an oxy
moron. The first point is that if you
can pick from a bigger pool you'll get
higher scores and theoretically
more qualified admits. The second is
that a lot of people who Stanford
would have considered perfectly good
candidates in the past are now being
rejected. The admissions pool is not
being inflated by long shots who add
Stanford on the Common Application
for the hell of it. The pool is good and
it's getting better. We're still rejecting
valedictorians and team captains and
future presidents and Nobel laure
ates. We're simply rejecting more of
them.

Stanford's rapidly increasing ap
plicant pools are not an isolated expe
rience: they represent larger trends
in college admissions. More people
are applying to Stanford than ever be
fore, and while it's tempting to say
that these applicants are because of
the increased visibility of the Univer
sity— for example, Stanford has an
elite football team while the Ivy
League schools don't that thesis is

simply not true. Admissions rates
have been declining across the board.
And asking whether Stanford has
anything to distinguish itself from its
peers raises the question of whether
Stanford has anything to distinguish
itself at all.
Criticisms of college generally fall
into two categories. The first that
of people like Malcolm Gladwell is
that a top-flight education doesn't re
ally help: that a person who is admit
ted to both Penn State and UPenn
will do just as well in life if he attends
either school. The second —which is
more of a corollary than a separate
critique is that of Peter Thiel, who
famously contended on Stanford's
campus that the only actual selling
point of Stanford is its exclusivity.
And it naturally follows that if the
basic underlying premise of universi
ty exclusivity that schools like
Stanford make the exclusive differ
ent from the excluded —is false,
then the exclusivity of schools like
Stanford is bound to collapse.
So the question is: What is the
point of Stanford?
I won't try to defend Stanford in
terms of its actual education right
now. To be clear, I firmly believe that the
opportunities Stanford has given me
are difficult if not impossible to repli
cate. I love this University, and if I had
thechancetodoitall over again, I would
attend Stanford all the same. But I don't
have any firsthand experience of the ed
ucational opportunities available at
other schools. I can't defend my belief
as rigorously as I would like.
But we can see that the expanding
applicant pools at schools like Stan
ford belie the growing national and in
ternational stature of these schools.
Improving transportation, communi
cation and financial aid resources at
Stanford and its peers are slowly
eroding the regional nature of higher
education, in the same way that a few
colleges are creating a national con
sensus on what school is the "best."
This is not to say that undergradu
ate admissions are not completely na
tional: While admit yield (the percent
age of admitted students who eventu
ally matriculate at the school) is nor
mally dominated by the national
schools you would expect, a list of
high-yield schools still features many
flagship state universities, such as
Alaska-Fairbanks and Nebraska. But
despite the continued prominence of
regional schools, the portability of a

Stanford degree is more apparent
than ever.

Does portability transcend utility?
I would like to think so: Moreover, I
would like to think that a Stanford de
gree will open any door and get me
any job. But a constantly looming
sense of uncertainty seems to hang
over every student in the humanities,
and many students in the less mar
ketable STEM fields too. As a human
ities student, I think that feeling's
mostly angst. But if it's angst, it's
angst that the rest of the country feels
as well.

Universities are improving their
infrastructure in attempts to market
themselves to a student body that is
theoretically more and more choosy.
Stanford is constantly renovating;
Harvard is pouring a small fortune
into effectively rebuilding its aging
Houses; Yale's undergraduate col
leges are undergoing similarly neces
sary upgrades; Chicago's marketing
efforts are a story in and of them
selves. As students, we are constantly
tempted to tell ourselves that we are
special and, unlike all others, deserve
to be here and every dollar spent in
the arms race between great colleges
seemingly reaffirms that sentiment.
Universities have excellent rea
sons to care more and more about
marketing; consider cross-admit
yields and the graduate student com
munity, each of which deserves an
essay all to itself. But these distant
struggles are mostly unseen by us un
dergraduates, and they do not reflect
what happens in our daily lives. As

fects our lives is not the admissions of
