When I first came to the Daily
office as a wide-eyed
Pro Fro, I was 16, a young
writer with no experience but a blog
post or two for a small online publi
cation back home. I didn't know
how much the next three years
would change me; I certainly did
not know that I would one day be
writing this letter.
Six months ago, I ran for this
position with the goal of reinvigo
rating the Daily classroom: We are
a newsroom and a business, but
above all we must be a place for stu
dent reporters, designers and pho
tographers to learn about the craft.
This is as true for me as it is for
every other Daily staffer.
But the Daily editorship has
taught me far more than manage
ment and communication skills.
More than anything, working here
has shown me the richness and di
versity of Stanford life. I saw the
very best of my peers' endeavors

by manning the student groups
news desk and felt what it was like
to be a true Stanford fan when Win
ston Shi prayed not only at the two
minute warning but on every third
down.

I learned that "my" Stanford
the school I knew in my early days
here was only a very small part
of the "real" Stanford. And while I
have spent my fair share of time
complaining of this place's social
ills duck syndrome, passive-ag
gressive competitiveness and "re
lentless politeness," among others
working at The Daily has shown
me that I may have been too cyni
cal, too closed-minded.
Above all, I feel incredibly lucky
to have had this opportunity. The
Daily has defined my college ca
reer so far and I am blessed for
everything it has given me. In par
ticular, I would like to thank Stan
ford's awesome Communication
Department, whose faculty and af
filiates have lent decades of irre
placeable support to student edi
tors.
I've learned a lot over my time
here, but I have had no education
quite like working with my friend
and The Daily's new editor in chief.
Regardless of his morning
midterm or a long night in the lab,
George Chen would burn the mid

night oil with me until the paper
was done. From him, I have learned
what it means to be an organized
manager, committed editor and
loyal friend. I can't thank him
enough and could not be more con
fident of the Daily's direction in the
coming volume.
"Farewell" is not the right way
to describe this column. In my plat
form for editor-in-chief, I ex
pressed hope that my tenure would
only serve as a launching point for
the two years of transformation
and innovation necessary to keep
The Daily current in an industry
undergoing breathtaking change.
This week, I return to my familiar
spot on the student groups news
desk, working with new writers
and covering Stanford's vibrant
student life. It's the job I am best
cut out for and something I remain
deeply passionate about.
I can't fathom what my life
would be like without The Daily.
I'm lucky I don't have to face that
reality for two more years.
Thank you, as always, for reading.
