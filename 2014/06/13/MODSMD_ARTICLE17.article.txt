## In defense of the humanities, computer science and the not-so-book-drunk English major

Fire up your favorite search
browser, and you'll find that for
every article written "in de
fense of the humanities," there exists
a second one covering the gazillion
dollar acquisition of a Stanford start
up, five Instagrams of a Google work
place perk and 10 Facebook photos of
classmates vacationing in a luxurious
part of the world because they
worked at Facebook or Google the
previous summer.
The latter finds do a good job of
continuing to ask if not literally
the hottest question of the 2010s:
Why study the humanities? Why
study the humanities at Stanford, a
school whose relationship with Silicon
Valley seems to run even thicker than
blood?
I did not ask myself those ques
tions when I switched from pre-med
Humßio to English my junior year.
Instead, I asked them the following
summer, when I ate purple velvet cup

cakes at Yahoo and oysters at Apple
courtesy of Mends, and listened to
those Mends talk about finding apart
ments without giving much consider
ation to money at all. I asked those
questions, like many other humani
ties students, at my first career fair
(in other words, my first blast of post
graduation reality). I asked them
when a professor referred to English
majors as "book-drunk" intellectuals,
and I thought, rather frantically, am
I book-drunk enough ?
I am not saying that purple velvet
cupcakes made me question my aca
demic decisions not even close.
But free cupcakes and nap pods rep
resent something greater: a future of
financial stability, funds to perhaps
travel the world and respectability, at
least in the sense that you didn't,
quantitatively speaking, squander
your parents' hard-earned money.
And if, like me, the image you associ
ate with "book-drunk" is a Daisy
Buchanan-esque character tossing
and drowning in books like they were
the fine silk T-shirts of Leonardo Di-

Caprio, then the promise of security,
and even a few luxuries, is enough to
make a not-as-book-drunk English
major start second-guessing herself.
I had wanted to study English be
cause I liked to read, write and ana
lyze, and I wanted to learn about liter
ature in a structured setting. I
thought I would get into the magazine
or publishing industry and work on
my own writing at night. I knew, how
ever, that I wasn't "passionate"
enough to become a professor, enter
academia and research a subject for
decades.
Yet what I discovered, after
switching into the major, was that
nearly every time I told someone I
studied English, he or she would an
swer, "You're doing what you love,"
"So you've seen the light," or "At
least, you're doing what you love." At
one point, it seemed as if another way
to answer the question of "Why study
the humanities at Stanford?" was
simply, "So you can do what you love."
And I couldn't help thinking that 'Ah,
so you're doing what you love" al
beit a response made with good inten
tions, or simply out of habit held
two assumptions: first, that all hu
manities students love what they
study so much that money takes a dis
tant second, and second, that CS ma
jors, or those studying something sim
ilarly marketable, don't enjoy what
they do, and are simply cogs in the ma
chine. A related third assumption is
that humanities students who end up
taking CS jobs are "selling out."
Considering that the technology
industry is no Cakewalk either, the
debate about whether a humanities
or CS major is "luckier" goes on. The
debate on why the humanities should
be studied will go on, too. I realize
that I have not answered that ques
tion because the answers are out
there already: You become a better
critical thinker, reader and writer,
skills highly valued in any industry;
you are pushed to contemplate
human nature, which is essentially

the stuff of life. The importance of the
humanities is inarguable, and impor
tant things should be studied.
What can be further argued is
how to keep less-certain humanities
students from automatically aban
doning their initial interests for a
more profitable field, given the na
ture and pressures of a school em
bedded in Silicon Valley. Just five
years ago, English was the fifth-most
awarded degree at Stanford; when it
will make the top five again remains
a hefty question mark.
Major-specific career counseling
should begin early for students inter
ested in the humanities, which the
CDC has recognized. I also have high
hopes for the new CS + X initiative,
which will launch CS-English and
CS-Music joint majors in the fall of
2015.1 don't believe that the joint ma
jors will cause either field to be adul
terated, and as I've grown older, I've
come to wholly support a piece of ad
vice from one of my Stanford teach
ers — that English majors should
have a "back-up plan" even if
that's not the intention of CS + X.
Lewis Carroll was a mathematician,
after all.
I don't believe that the fuzzy
techie divide between students is

that palpable at Stanford, either, but
I do believe that denigrating CS as
boring, unoriginal or "selling-out" in
order to make humanities majors
feel better about their futures should
be discouraged. English majors
aren't supposed to be unicorns, and
when you groom them like they are,
what does that say about both the
"fuzzy" and "techie" fields?
I'm still an English major, by the
way. But I grew up ten minutes away
from Apple's headquarters, and my
engineer father has always stressed
the importance of learning at least a
little bit of code. So I attended the
first lecture of CS 1068 last week,
where the professor informed us that
the same number of declared Eng
lish majors and CS majors were en
rolled in the course.
Those numbers have a lot to do
with the fact that most students in
terested in CS do not declare until
after 1068, of course, but for a fleet
ing moment I wondered: How inter
esting would it be if an English class
enrolled the same number of CS ma
jors as English majors?
