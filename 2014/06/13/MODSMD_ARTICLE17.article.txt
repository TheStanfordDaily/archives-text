## In defense of the humanities, computer science and the not-so-book-drunk English major

Fire up your favorite search
browser, and you'll find that for
every article written "in de
fense of the humanities," there exists
a second one covering the gazillion
dollar acquisition of a Stanford start
up, five Instagrams of a Google work
place perk and 10 Facebook photos of
classmates vacationing in a luxurious
part of the world because they
worked at Facebook or Google the
previous summer.
The latter finds do a good job of
continuing to ask if not literally
the hottest question of the 2010s:
Why study the humanities? Why
study the humanities at Stanford, a
school whose relationship with Silicon
Valley seems to run even thicker than
blood?
I did not ask myself those ques
tions when I switched from pre-med
Hum√üio to English my junior year.
Instead, I asked them the following
summer, when I ate purple velvet cup

cakes at Yahoo and oysters at Apple
courtesy of Mends, and listened to
those Mends talk about finding apart
ments without giving much consider
ation to money at all. I asked those
questions, like many other humani
ties students, at my first career fair
(in other words, my first blast of post
graduation reality). I asked them
when a professor referred to English
majors as "book-drunk" intellectuals,
and I thought, rather frantically, am
I book-drunk enough ?
I am not saying that purple velvet
cupcakes made me question my aca
demic decisions not even close.
But free cupcakes and nap pods rep
resent something greater: a future of
financial stability, funds to perhaps
travel the world and respectability, at
least in the sense that you didn't,
quantitatively speaking, squander
your parents' hard-earned money.
And if, like me, the image you associ
ate with "book-drunk" is a Daisy
Buchanan-esque character tossing
and drowning in books like they were
the fine silk T-shirts of Leonardo Di-

Caprio, then the promise of security,
and even a few luxuries, is enough to
make a not-as-book-drunk English
major start second-guessing herself.
I had wanted to study English be
cause I liked to read, write and ana
lyze, and I wanted to learn about liter
ature in a structured setting. I
thought I would get into the magazine
or publishing industry and work on
my own writing at night. I knew, how
ever, that I wasn't "passionate"
enough to become a professor, enter
academia and research a subject for
decades.
Yet what I discovered, after
switching into the major, was that
nearly every time I told someone I
studied English, he or she would an
swer, "You're doing what you love,"
"So you've seen the light," or "At
least, you're doing what you love." At
one point, it seemed as if another way
to answer the question of "Why study
the humanities at Stanford?" was
simply, "So you can do what you love."
