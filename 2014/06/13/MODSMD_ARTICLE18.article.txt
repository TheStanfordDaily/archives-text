# DAILY STAFFER SENIOR REFLECTION
## 
### KURT CHIRBAS 
It was in a high school j ournalism lab that I
received my Stanford acceptance. I was
shocked then, wondering whether the
email was some deadline-induced hallucina
tion, and I am still shocked now, as I prepare
for Commencement ceremonies.
Looking back on that moment, I can now
recognize how appropriate the setting was.
Journalism would turn out to shape (and in
many ways, define) my time as an undergrad.
I can link many of my major life events these
past four years to The Daily, where I had the
honor to write and edit news.
For example:
1.1 remember after my parents drove off
from freshmen year move-in, I retreated to
my dorm room. A few seconds of panic hit, and
then, I sent send an email to The Daily's edi
tor in chief, asking if she had any need for new
writers. I'm so grateful Ellie Titus responded
immediately and said yes. The Daily gave me
a sense of purpose right off the bat and helped
to ease my transition to college.
2.1 arrived late to my first undergraduate
class because an interview for The Daily had
lasted longer than anticipated. (It included a
lengthy digression on how dog excrement had
once piled up in The Dish.) This would not be
the last time The Daily presented a conflict
with academics, as anyone who edits for the
paper can attest.
3. In January of freshmen year, I became a
staff writer. I remember my dorm mates
(shout out to Charlotte, Zoe, Brian, Matt and
Sasha) made a poster, complete with marker
drawn recorders and all, to celebrate the
news. The Daily helped me feel part of a com
munity, both with the students who read its
pages and with fellow staff members.
4. Sophomore year, I served as one of the
paper's managing editors of news. Taking on a
position of such responsibility, often having a

say on which stories would run and whether
corrections would be issued, improved my
self-confidence immensely. It also had an ad
verse effect on my grades (see number 2).
5. And these past two years, I had the op
portunity to write and edit articles that al
lowed me to see how students who come to
gether, bonded by a common interest, can re
ally affect change. It can be to create a com
munity garden, or restore student-manage
ment to Suites, or (hopefully) reform the Uni
versity's sexual assault policies.
The Daily plays such a large role in my
Stanford story because it has empowered me.
My editors and my sources all put immense
trust in me: my editors to follow reporting
ethics and pursue potential leads tirelessly,
and my sources to tell their stories as accu
rately as possible.
This was not a responsibility that I took
lightly. I knew my actions would all ultimately
reflect back on The Daily. (Just ask a Univer
sity department, still miffed by a headline
error made back in '08.)
By working for The Daily, I not only
formed deep friendships and learned new
skills, but I also gained trust in myself. I am
grateful to all the Daily editors who entrusted
me with responsibilities and allowed me to
learn from mistakes. This includes all eight
students and former students who have
served as editor in chief during my time here:
Ellie Titus, Zach Zimmerman, Kathleen
Chaykowski, Margaret Rawson, Billy Gal
lagher, Ed Ngai and George Chen.
As I leave Stanford, I'm not sure what lies
next, but I am certain The Daily will have
helped prepare me for it. Thank you Mom and
Dad, for supporting me even though I never
followed your advise to take on less Daily
work; all of my teachers and professors, for
helping me to become a stronger thinker and
communicator; and my peers, who have made
this journey the wonder it has become.
