# FROM BLACK AND WHITE TO SHADES OF GREY
## Reflecting on my activism at Stanford

I began senior year pretty jaded,
feeling like I had very little left
to learn at Stanford. I had spent
time in Cape Town, Detroit and
Palestine over the prior nine
months watching people who were
directly engaged in social move
ments, and so I was eager to escape
the over-manufactured Stanford
bubble for the real world. But the
intervening months have proved
my self-assuredness and cynicism
very wrong.
I spent all of last quarter teach
ing a class on theories and methods
of affecting social change with my
best friend, in preparation for an
Alternative Spring Break trip we
led looking at Black, Arab and
queer organizing as case studies for
doing our own justice-based work.
Some of the biggest lessons I
learned during ASB came from my
fellow participants. During one of
our nightly reflections, one friend
asked whether how he a white
student might ever contribute to
a place like minority-majority
Stockton, where we spent the day
visiting.
The answer our group came up
with that you can work across
identity and perceptions if you ap
proach a community with humility
recalled exactly my experience
in Detroit last summer. And I re
flected that while I was a black per
son entering a predominantly black
city, my skin color did not imply that
I was immediately accepted or that
I could identify with Detroiters'
struggles. While not ignoring the

reality that I likely did have an eas
ier time integrating into the com
munity as a black person, the privi
leges of my educational and social
background make me closer to my
white friend than not. Regardless of
background, we all share the asso
ciations of our common denomina
tor Stanford University.
Towards the end of our trip, we
sat with longtime East Palo Alto or
ganizer Bob Hoover and heard him
predict EPA's complete gentrifica
tion in four or five years, thanks to
the growth of companies like Face
book and Google and the predatory
speculation on low-cost housing in
the neighborhood. Regardless of
how we identify politically, all Stan
ford students should understand
how our university and the industry
to which it's tied and into which
many of us will go is directly related
to the continued injustice facing
people just down the road from us.
Debriefing our trip with faculty
at the end of the trip, one professor
recalled author Adam Mansbach's
response to a Ph.D. student's ques
tion during the Occupy Art class in
2012. The student had asked Adam
how she could shed the "contamina
tion" of her Stanford degree in
order to continue engaging with the
communities she cared about.
Adam's response, "It's too f king

late!" feels especially resonant.
None of us can give back the experi
ences, advantages and complicity
we've gained as Stanford students,
even if we are disturbed by the
deeply unjust power dynamics that
give us so much while leaving the
majority of the world with so little.
None of us can give back the un
earned advantages or disadvan
tages of our skin color, of our fami
ly's wealth, our nationality or sexu
ality. We can, however, control what
we do with our (in many cases un
earned) privileges. While I have al
ways tried to judge people based on
their actions and less so on my as
sumptions, this notion does escape
me at times. It is easy to see things
as black and white (especially
things like blackness and white
ness). My pledge for the coming
nine weeks is to work against as
suming people's politics based on
how I perceive them, to work to use
language and ideas that are accessi
ble outside of activist circles and to
work to meet people where they are
to figure out where our common
ground is.
My favorite metaphor from our
trip came during the South Asian
Berkeley Radical Activism History
Walking Tour, when our guides
were discussing how to engage with
groups whose politics seem ques
tionable to us: If we're not on the
same page , are we at least on
the same chapter? Even though
those of us in more progressive cir
cles may have criticisms of others
with less radical politics, this still
remains a good metric for deciding


how to work with other people. I
myself was intimidated by the
words imperialism, colonialism and
neoliberalism two years ago, and I
did not grow to engage with them
by being told my politics were in
consistent or problematic, but by

having friends who were willing to
answer questions, provide food for
thought and let me set my own pace
along the way.
Not everyone will understand or
agree with my analysis and criti
cisms of capitalism and racism, but
presumably most agree that class
and race should not correlate with
whether someone has a successful
life, and I'd like to see where we can
move from there. To take this idea
even further, I would like to spend

the remainder of my time consider
ing what legendary BSU leader
Steve Phillips 'B6 wrote about the
organization's ideology through
South African divestment and the
protests over Western Civ require
ments: "No permanent friends, no
permanent enemies only per
manent interests."
As I look to the next stage of
what will be a life of addressing ex
ploitation, racism and the misdeeds
of my national government, I hope

to hold all of these lessons dear and
deep. While continuing to maintain
a critical lens and to urge others to
do the same, I hope that I can en
gage with people who are genuine
ly interested in these topics in ways
that are welcoming and mutually
beneficial. I look forward to spend
ing my last quarter trying.
