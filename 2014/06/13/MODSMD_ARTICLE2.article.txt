## Cardinal defend Pac-12 title Stanford beats ASU, plays in 100th Rose Bowl Game 
### GEORGE CHEN EDITOR IN CHIEF

All year long, Stanford had strug
gled to play complete games.
Against Arizona State in Septem
ber, the Cardinal jumped out to a 22-
point lead only to allow the Sun Devils
score three straight touchdowns.
Against Utah in October, the Cardinal
sleepwalked through most of the game
before a furious fourth quarter fell just
short. And against Oregon on Nov. 7,
Stanford played its best football of the
season for three-and-a-half quarters,
but still let the Ducks claw their way
back to make the game come down to an
onside kick.

But on Saturday night, there was no
doubting that No. 7 Stanford (11-2,7-2
Pac-12) played a complete game on the
conference's biggest stage to defeat No.
11 Arizona State (10-3,8-1) 38-14 at Sun
Devil Stadium and defend its Pac-12
title. The Cardinal booked its return
trip to Pasadena for the Rose Bowl
Game the 100 th Rose Bowl Game,
no less and will be going to its fourth
BCS bowl game in as many seasons.
"I told the players what was at
stake," said head coach David Shaw.
"What was a stake was their legacy."
Ever the workhorse, senior running

back Tyler Gaffney responded to his
coach's challenge by rushing for 133
yards his ninth 100-yard game of the
season and three touchdowns on 22
carries. In the process, Gaffney passed
Stepfan Taylor 'l3 for second all-time
Stanford single-season rushing yards.
Gaffney was watching from the stands
when the Cardinal secured a Rose Bowl
berth on a rainy night in Palo Alto last
year, but by the end of Saturday night,
Gaffney was celebrating with his team
mates atop the podium and clutching
the Pac-12 Championship Game Most
Valuable Player trophy in his hands.
"It's unreal," Gaffney said. "Just to

out here with Stanford guys. This is why I came
back. Being on this stage is why you came
back."
The Cardinal offense didn't get off to a good
start after Gaffney slipped on the first play and
a subsequent false start penalty put Stanford in
a second-and-17 hole. But just when it seemed
like the offense was going to suffer the same
early-game struggles that it was plagued by in
last month's loss at USC, Gaffney bounced to the
outside and broke loose for a 69-yard touchdown
run.
Coming into the game averaging 49 points
per game at home, Arizona State answered on
its first drive when running back D.J. Foster
scampered through a gaping hole in the middle
of the field to score a 51-yard touchdown. A rare
mistake by the Cardinal defense, it was the
longest running play that the unit had given up
all season.
But, in a reversal of roles for shutdown Stan
ford, the Cardinal offense stepped up.
After being criticized for his poor road perform
ances against Oregon State and USC, junior
quarterback Kevin Hogan was accurate from
the get-go, highlighted by his 42-yard comple
tion to junior wide receiver Devon Cajuste late
in the first quarter. Hogan showed great poise in
front of a hostile crowd, as he lead the Cardinal
into the end zone on its first four drives.
Two more Gaffney touchdowns sandwiched
a 22-yard end-around touchdown run by junior
wideout Ty Montgomery to give Stanford a 28-7
lead early in the second quarter.
"It's all about toughness," Gaffney said. "Ex
ecution and toughness. Falling forward and get
ting those extra yards not letting guys bring
you down."
The Sun Devils started to bring down Hogan for
sacks midway through the second quarter to
stop Stanford's scoring spree and get the ball
back into their offense. The most explosive play
er on the field in the first half, Foster caught a
short pass from quarterback Taylor Kelly, made
junior safety Jordan Richards miss and took it to
the house for a 65-yard touchdown that made
the score 28-14 at halftime.
But that would be Arizona State's last points
on the night.
ASU's offense drove down to the Cardinal 14
on its first possession of the third quarter, but
Zane Gonzalez, who had made 18 consecutive
field-goal attempts coming into the game,
missed a 31-yard try just wide right. Senior kick
er Jordan Williamson fared better for the Cardi
nal, as he nailed a 30-yard field goal his first
field goal attempt in the state of Arizona since
the Fiesta Bowl disaster on the ensuing pos
session.
For the rest of the game, the Cardinal de
fense was in full control and even made a goal
line stand aided by fifth-year- inside line
backer Shayne Skov timing the snap perfectly
on third down and sophomore safety Zach Hoff
pauir making the biggest tackle of his career on
fourth-and-goal to hold the Sun Devils score
less in the second half.
Coming into the game with eight 250-yard
passing games, Kelly was limited to just 173
yards through the air. The Sun Devils' ineffec
tive passing game was a big a reason why they
were only able to convert 5 of 16 third downs on
the night.
Following the goal-line stand, the Cardinal put
the game away with a 99-yard touchdown drive.
On third-and-6 at the Stanford 5-yard line,
Hogan threw a perfect deep ball to Cajuste, who
took the pitch-and-catch for a 78-yard gain.
Three plays later, Hogan threw a dart to Mont
gomery for a 24-yard touchdown that gave Stan
ford a 38-14 lead with 12 minutes left in the
game.
Averaging 23.1 yards per completion, Hogan
would finish the game 12-of-18 passing for 277
yards and a touchdown.
"The bottom line is if the team tries to stop
the run, we have to make big plays in the passing
game," Shaw said.
Arizona State couldn't even cross midfield in
the fourth quarter. Though the Cardinal defense
sawits turnover streak snapped at 36 games, the
unit sacked the Kelly three times in the fomth
quarter to destroy any hopes of an ASU come
back.
"We stayed aggressive," Shaw said. "We
stayed aggressive the whole time."
With its second straight Pac-12 title under its
belt, Stanford will now prepare to play against
Big Ten champion Michigan State in the
100 th Rose Bowl Game on Jan. 1. The Cardinal
moved up to No. 5 in the AP Poll and No. 7 in the
Coaches Poll on Sunday morning; the Spartans
are No. 4 in both.

like the offense was going to suffer the same
early-game struggles that it was plagued by in
last month's loss at USC, Gaffney bounced to the
outside and broke loose for a 69-yard touchdown
run.
Coming into the game averaging 49 points
per game at home, Arizona State answered on
its first drive when running back D.J. Foster
scampered through a gaping hole in the middle
of the field to score a 51-yard touchdown. A rare
mistake by the Cardinal defense, it was the
longest running play that the unit had given up
all season.
But, in a reversal of roles for shutdown Stan
ford, the Cardinal offense stepped up.
After being criticized for his poor road perform
ances against Oregon State and USC, junior
quarterback Kevin Hogan was accurate from
the get-go, highlighted by his 42-yard comple
tion to junior wide receiver Devon Cajuste late
in the first quarter. Hogan showed great poise in
front of a hostile crowd, as he lead the Cardinal
into the end zone on its first four drives.
Two more Gaffney touchdowns sandwiched
a 22-yard end-around touchdown run by junior
wideout Ty Montgomery to give Stanford a 28-7
lead early in the second quarter.
"It's all about toughness," Gaffney said. "Ex
ecution and toughness. Falling forward and get
ting those extra yards not letting guys bring
you down."
The Sun Devils started to bring down Hogan for
sacks midway through the second quarter to
stop Stanford's scoring spree and get the ball
back into their offense. The most explosive play
er on the field in the first half, Foster caught a
short pass from quarterback Taylor Kelly, made
junior safety Jordan Richards miss and took it to
the house for a 65-yard touchdown that made
the score 28-14 at halftime.
But that would be Arizona State's last points
on the night.
ASU's offense drove down to the Cardinal 14
on its first possession of the third quarter, but
Zane Gonzalez, who had made 18 consecutive
field-goal attempts coming into the game,
missed a 31-yard try just wide right. Senior kick
er Jordan Williamson fared better for the Cardi
nal, as he nailed a 30-yard field goal his first
field goal attempt in the state of Arizona since
the Fiesta Bowl disaster on the ensuing pos
session.
For the rest of the game, the Cardinal de
fense was in full control and even made a goal
line stand aided by fifth-year- inside line
backer Shayne Skov timing the snap perfectly
on third down and sophomore safety Zach Hoff
pauir making the biggest tackle of his career on
fourth-and-goal to hold the Sun Devils score
less in the second half.
Coming into the game with eight 250-yard
passing games, Kelly was limited to just 173
yards through the air. The Sun Devils' ineffec
tive passing game was a big a reason why they
were only able to convert 5 of 16 third downs on
the night.
Following the goal-line stand, the Cardinal put
the game away with a 99-yard touchdown drive.
On third-and-6 at the Stanford 5-yard line,
Hogan threw a perfect deep ball to Cajuste, who
took the pitch-and-catch for a 78-yard gain.
Three plays later, Hogan threw a dart to Mont
gomery for a 24-yard touchdown that gave Stan
ford a 38-14 lead with 12 minutes left in the
game.
Averaging 23.1 yards per completion, Hogan
would finish the game 12-of-18 passing for 277
yards and a touchdown.
"The bottom line is if the team tries to stop
the run, we have to make big plays in the passing
game," Shaw said.
Arizona State couldn't even cross midfield in
the fourth quarter. Though the Cardinal defense
sawits turnover streak snapped at 36 games, the
unit sacked the Kelly three times in the fomth
quarter to destroy any hopes of an ASU come
back.
"We stayed aggressive," Shaw said. "We
stayed aggressive the whole time."
With its second straight Pac-12 title under its
belt, Stanford will now prepare to play against
Big Ten champion Michigan State in the
100 th Rose Bowl Game on Jan. 1. The Cardinal
moved up to No. 5 in the AP Poll and No. 7 in the
Coaches Poll on Sunday morning; the Spartans
are No. 4 in both.
