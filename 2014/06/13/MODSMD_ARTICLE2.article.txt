All year long, Stanford had strug
gled to play complete games.
Against Arizona State in Septem
ber, the Cardinal jumped out to a 22-
point lead only to allow the Sun Devils
score three straight touchdowns.
Against Utah in October, the Cardinal
sleepwalked through most of the game
before a furious fourth quarter fell just
short. And against Oregon on Nov. 7,
Stanford played its best football of the
season for three-and-a-half quarters,
but still let the Ducks claw their way
back to make the game come down to an
onside kick.

But on Saturday night, there was no
doubting that No. 7 Stanford (11-2,7-2
Pac-12) played a complete game on the

Devil Stadium and defend its Pac-12
title. The Cardinal booked its return
trip to Pasadena for the Rose Bowl
Game the 100 th Rose Bowl Game,
no less and will be going to its fourth
BCS bowl game in as many seasons.
"I told the players what was at
stake," said head coach David Shaw.
"What was a stake was their legacy."
Ever the workhorse, senior running

back Tyler Gaffney responded to his
coach's challenge by rushing for 133
yards his ninth 100-yard game of the
season and three touchdowns on 22
carries. In the process, Gaffney passed
Stepfan Taylor 'l3 for second all-time
Stanford single-season rushing yards.
Gaffney was watching from the stands
when the Cardinal secured a Rose Bowl
berth on a rainy night in Palo Alto last
year, but by the end of Saturday night,
Gaffney was celebrating with his team
mates atop the podium and clutching
the Pac-12 Championship Game Most
Valuable Player trophy in his hands.
"It's unreal," Gaffney said. "Just to
have the opportunity to be out there
you can't even explain it. I love being
