## The 						false promise of entrepreneurship

On Monday, The Daily pub
lished an opinion column
about entrepreneurship that I
felt captured much of what's wrong
about the way that Stanford and
many of its students are currently
thinking about undergraduate edu
cation. I reacted swiftly and angrily
on Facebook, so I want to take some
time here to discuss more extensive
ly how Stanford's intense focus on
entrepreneurship and startup cul
ture distracts from real problems
and stifles real meaning.
Old folk like me will doubtless re
member the ASSU Executive elec
tion of three years past, which gave
us the audacious and ambitious
Stanford 2.0 platform that adver
tised "student government as social
entrepreneurship." The campaign
website was slickly designed and
stuffed with promises that this new
approach would revolutionize stu
dent life, and the voters said yes
please. On August 26,2011, nearly a
month before fall quarter began, the
new ASSU sent out an email pro
claiming itself "The World's Most
Effective & Innovative Student
Government."
According to their so-called
"Checklist 2.0," this ragtag team of
entrepreneurs accomplished no
more or no less than your average,
old-fashioned ASSU Executives.
Premised on the prospect of future
value, Stanford 2.0 perfectly encap
sulated what entrepreneurial ven
tures so often come to: aggressive
branding with little to no worthwhile
substance.
We see that word, entrepre
neurship, all the time, in the flyers
lining our bathroom stalls and in the
emails that StartX inexplicably has
permission to send to the entire
campus. We even had an entire dorm
devoted to it last year, the eDorm in
Suites. Yet the more e's we add to
building names and drop from app
names, the more the word simply
becomes shorthand for a fast track
to a million dollars.

Or a billion dollars. Or three bil
lion. Or 19 billion. It is no longer a se
cret that the primary goal of entre
preneurship and startup culture is
not to build anything new but to
catch the attention and cash flow of
Facebook, Google, Twitter, Apple,
Linkedln or any of those other com
panies that populate Silicon Valley.
As I said in my initial reaction on
Facebook, there is nothing wrong
with this kind of entrepreneurship,
but there's also nothing right about
it. The startups that have arisen in
recent years, from Snapchat to Do
or Dash to Shouttto RacoonVille, are
focused entirely on making money
from previously untapped markets.
They contribute essentially nothing
to technological innovation: They
may make our lives easier, but hard
ly in groundbreaking ways. I haven't
seen any evidence that the value that
these startups do add to the world
substantially benefits anybody
other than their employees and
shareholders.
Stanford invests in startups, pro
vides many others with the initial
technological resources necessary
to get their businesses off the
ground and celebrates startup cul
ture as alumni donations start flow
ing in. Naturally, the path of entre
preneurship is understandably at
tractive to many Stanford students.
Although it can be a high-risk path,
Stanford provides so much support
and backup that it almost seems
foolish not to follow it.
This is the false promise of entre
preneurship that through money
we can find meaning. Entrepreneur
ship measures success in dollars
earned, not in stomachs fed or lives
enriched. It conflates life goals with
business benchmarks and purpose
ful dialogue with focus-grouped
branding. Money will perpetually
dominate our conversations, but too
often at Stanford we talk about
those who already have money while
ignoring those who do not have
enough.
We should be better than that,
and in many ways we are. During my
time at Stanford, I have met scores

of people who inspire and astound
me. These are the people who take
weekly Marguerite rides to volun
teer in East Palo Alto, who fight to
keep a homeless shelter open down
town and who commit to teaching in
underserved communities. Beyond
the realm of public service, I know
artists who aspire to create and en
tertain, future doctors who aspire to
research new drugs and vaccines
and, yes, computer scientists who
aspire to build technologies that
make our government more effi
cient and our world more secure.
I have to believe that we all enter
Stanford with the passionate search
for greater meaning ablaze within
us. But as the senior class approach
es graduation, I can see that this
flame has begun to flicker. For some,
it's already out. Personally, mine is
burning dimly, suffocated by anxi
ety, self-doubt and resignation to the
economic realities of the world out
side the Stanford Bubble.
There must be away for Stan
ford to help us hold on to that pas
sion the same passion that Stan
ford's gatekeepers lauded when
they let us in. If Stanford is to take
seriously its majors in the humani
ties, social sciences and natural sci
ences, then it must actively combat
that end-of-college feeling that
choosing those majors was a mis
take. Opportunities for a well-paid
and relevant first job do exist, but
they are fiercely competitive and
woefully finite.
Otherwise, the next "best" op
tion is money-driven entrepreneur
ship. The allure is intoxicating
that's why I voted for Stanford 2.0
three years ago. Maybe it's not such
a bad thing to live comfortably in Sil
icon Valley, pushing the limits of eco
nomic sanity. Maybe that's the direc
tion that Stanford wants to take into
the future. But if that's the case,
then it's not the Stanford I want to
attend anymore. It's certainly not
the Stanford we were promised.

it. The startups that have arisen in
recent years, from Snapchat to Do
or Dash to Shouttto RacoonVille, are
focused entirely on making money
from previously untapped markets.
They contribute essentially nothing
to technological innovation: They
may make our lives easier, but hard
ly in groundbreaking ways. I haven't
seen any evidence that the value that
these startups do add to the world
substantially benefits anybody
other than their employees and
shareholders.
Stanford invests in startups, pro
vides many others with the initial
technological resources necessary
to get their businesses off the
ground and celebrates startup cul
ture as alumni donations start flow
ing in. Naturally, the path of entre
preneurship is understandably at
tractive to many Stanford students.
Although it can be a high-risk path,
Stanford provides so much support
and backup that it almost seems
foolish not to follow it.
This is the false promise of entre
preneurship that through money
we can find meaning. Entrepreneur
ship measures success in dollars
earned, not in stomachs fed or lives
enriched. It conflates life goals with
business benchmarks and purpose
ful dialogue with focus-grouped
branding. Money will perpetually
dominate our conversations, but too
often at Stanford we talk about
those who already have money while
ignoring those who do not have
enough.
We should be better than that,
and in many ways we are. During my
time at Stanford, I have met scores

of people who inspire and astound
me. These are the people who take
weekly Marguerite rides to volun
teer in East Palo Alto, who fight to
keep a homeless shelter open down
town and who commit to teaching in
underserved communities. Beyond
the realm of public service, I know
artists who aspire to create and en
tertain, future doctors who aspire to
research new drugs and vaccines
and, yes, computer scientists who
aspire to build technologies that
make our government more effi
cient and our world more secure.
I have to believe that we all enter
Stanford with the passionate search
for greater meaning ablaze within
us. But as the senior class approach
es graduation, I can see that this
flame has begun to flicker. For some,
it's already out. Personally, mine is
burning dimly, suffocated by anxi
ety, self-doubt and resignation to the
economic realities of the world out
side the Stanford Bubble.
There must be away for Stan
ford to help us hold on to that pas
sion the same passion that Stan
ford's gatekeepers lauded when
they let us in. If Stanford is to take
seriously its majors in the humani
ties, social sciences and natural sci
ences, then it must actively combat
that end-of-college feeling that
choosing those majors was a mis
take. Opportunities for a well-paid
and relevant first job do exist, but
they are fiercely competitive and
woefully finite.
Otherwise, the next "best" op
tion is money-driven entrepreneur
ship. The allure is intoxicating
that's why I voted for Stanford 2.0
three years ago. Maybe it's not such
a bad thing to live comfortably in Sil
icon Valley, pushing the limits of eco
nomic sanity. Maybe that's the direc
tion that Stanford wants to take into
the future. But if that's the case,
then it's not the Stanford I want to
attend anymore. It's certainly not
the Stanford we were promised.

On Monday, The Daily pub
lished an opinion column
about entrepreneurship that I
felt captured much of what's wrong
about the way that Stanford and
many of its students are currently
thinking about undergraduate edu
cation. I reacted swiftly and angrily
on Facebook, so I want to take some
time here to discuss more extensive
ly how Stanford's intense focus on
entrepreneurship and startup cul
ture distracts from real problems
and stifles real meaning.
Old folk like me will doubtless re
member the ASSU Executive elec
tion of three years past, which gave
us the audacious and ambitious
Stanford 2.0 platform that adver
tised "student government as social
entrepreneurship." The campaign
website was slickly designed and
stuffed with promises that this new
approach would revolutionize stu
dent life, and the voters said yes
please. On August 26,2011, nearly a
month before fall quarter began, the
new ASSU sent out an email pro
claiming itself "The World's Most
Effective & Innovative Student
Government."
According to their so-called
"Checklist 2.0," this ragtag team of
entrepreneurs accomplished no
more or no less than your average,
old-fashioned ASSU Executives.
Premised on the prospect of future
value, Stanford 2.0 perfectly encap
sulated what entrepreneurial ven
tures so often come to: aggressive
branding with little to no worthwhile
substance.
We see that word, entrepre
neurship, all the time, in the flyers
lining our bathroom stalls and in the
emails that StartX inexplicably has
permission to send to the entire
campus. We even had an entire dorm
devoted to it last year, the eDorm in
Suites. Yet the more e's we add to
building names and drop from app
names, the more the word simply
becomes shorthand for a fast track
to a million dollars.

Or a billion dollars. Or three bil
lion. Or 19 billion. It is no longer a se
cret that the primary goal of entre
preneurship and startup culture is
not to build anything new but to
catch the attention and cash flow of
Facebook, Google, Twitter, Apple,
Linkedln or any of those other com
panies that populate Silicon Valley.
