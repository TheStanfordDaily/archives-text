# The 						theory of Stanford: a senior reflection

As I prepare to leave Stanford, I
have begun to make a mental
recording of all that I see, as a
sailor in the pre-photographic age
might have stared at the objects in his
room one last time before he em
barked on a voyage that may take half
his life. And under that light of dawn,
where every object reveals its true
form, I see that my time here has
been utterly different from my child
hood in Korea, my boarding school
years in New England and my two
years of military service back in
Korea after my freshman year a
difference marked not by uniqueness,
for no hour is experienced twice, but
by its unparalleled beauty.
Part of Stanford's beauty has to do
with personal history the events
that took place and the people I met
here a product of nostalgia that
can clothe the most mundane coinci
dences with the garments of fate.
However, much of it has to do with a
kind of beauty that does not need in
terpretation, an a prion perfection
self-evident even to the rabbits in
Lake Lag.
When I sit on the ledge of the foun
tain by the west entrance of Green Li
brary and watch the sunset brim over
the arches of the Main Quad, them
selves framed by a sky reminiscent of
a Rothko painting, I feel as if the heav
ens were made for me. It seems incon
ceivable that anything bad should
happen in this world. For a moment, I
feel invulnerable.
I know that this is an illusion. If my
military service in the Republic of
Korea Army during my two years of
leave from Stanford taught me any
thing, it was the fact that a human
being in essence is no different from a
dog that children can drown for play.
Within the first few days of boot
camp, I realized that my former sense
of identity was largely based on my
social status, stripped of which I was a
mass of bone and muscle that re
quired a threshold amount of heat and

food to survive. This was a very differ
ent definition of humanity from the
one I had developed through my edu
cation at boarding school and Stan
ford and came as a great shock to me.
But what was more surprising was
that one got used to these conditions
and survived on the stale biscuits the
army gave out between brainwashing
sessions where we were trained to kill
North Koreans.
Some did not survive. On March
26, 2010, 46 soldiers drowned with
their ship that was hit by a North Ko
rean toipedo. In November 23 of the
same year two marines were killed by
artillery shelling of an island off the
western coast of Korea. I had been se
lected to be an interpreter after basic
infantry training and spent the rest of
my service behind a computer in the
headquarters of U.S. Forces Korea, at
the center of Seoul. My chances of
dying in combat were practically zero.
But attending funerals of soldiers my
age and witnessing man's helpless
ness at the cruelty of chance have
since instilled inside me a perennial
recognition of death that is like a fre
quency between silence and screech
that only certain animals can hear.
I hear it even as I write this in a
light-flooded room with the smell of
cut grass in the air. Last month, a
cruiser capsized off the southern
coast of Korea with 475 passengers on
board, 325 of whom were high school
students on a school trip. The captain
and the crew left the ship without giv
ing orders to escape, and most pas
sengers remained in their cabins, as
they were told when the ship started
tilting. At the moment of my writing,
282 have been confirmed dead and 22
bodies are still missing. Videos
recorded on the students' phones of
their last hours inside the ship have
been recovered from their corpses
and released by the media, but I don't
have the heart to watch them. I pause
wilting and try holding my breath as
long as possible. The pain of suffoca
tion is beyond my imagination.
The degree of empowerment one
receives at Stanford is almost super
human. Sometimes, looking at the
night sky from the Oval after a run, I
feel like I will outlast the stars. Sure
ly, part of the sense of invulnerability
has to do with youth itself. But it also
has to do with what Stanford strives
to teach us day by day: that the world
is ours to change and that we have
the power to change it. However,
when faced with events such as the
recent calamity in Korea, I find it dif
ficult to reconcile Stanford with the
rest of the world.
Stanford is not an accurate model
of the world. Things that we take for
granted here and I don't mean the
weather, but rather basic conditions
of life such as freedom from fear
are absent in the vast majority of the
world. Having left Stanford, we will
find that the knowledge of justice
does not make us immune to injus
tice. We will be victimized by chance
as much as others. The talk about de
signing one's life will not help us
against a tsunami or a brain tumor,
whose form life takes far more often

than a closed system where friction
and air resistance are assumed to not
exist.
Then what is the gift I take from
Stanford if not the preparation for
life after Stanford?
I have come to believe that the
purpose of higher education is not to
prepare one for life but rather to
show what life can be. As an interna
tional student, my education in
America as a whole has been a
process of learning what humanity is
capable of in abundance and free
dom. Despite what some may think,
America is a paradise compared to
most of the world, and out of the vast
expanse of her 50 states, Stanford
may be her epitome.
During my time here, as I wit
nessed Nobel-worthy discoveries
like optogenetics, milestones in gen
der equality and construction of won
ders like the Bing Performing Arts
Center, in the back of my mind there
was a constant recognition of what I
was seeing as a theory that must be
tested outside the gates of Stanford.
As graduation approaches, the sheer
brilliance of this place seems almost
unreal.
Some of us may choose never to
leave Stanford. In fact, a significant
percentage of alumni choose to re
main in the Bay Area. That is your

own decision to make. But to mistake
the theory of Stanford for reality
without testing it will only validate
the criticism that higher education
fosters an elitism that isolates one
from the rest of the world. You might
say that you do not want to have to do
anything with the rest of the world.
But you already know, from the one
time you were able to bring happi
ness to another person's life, that the
gift of life cannot be received in isola
tion, that the most profound experi
ences of our lives are those experi
enced in the plural though we
enter and leave this world alone.
I, too, do not know what life holds
for me. But to enable others to expe
rience the beauty that I experienced
here, to bring the theory of Stanford
into reality in places without light or
warmth that is my goal, and that
sense of purpose is the gift that I
take from Stanford. Take a moment
to appreciate the blessing that is
your life right now. Life after Stan
ford will be difficult. But you will re
member what happened here during
these years. Also, what you know to
be true. What you know is possible.

feel invulnerable.
I know that this is an illusion. If my
military service in the Republic of
Korea Army during my two years of
leave from Stanford taught me any
thing, it was the fact that a human
being in essence is no different from a
dog that children can drown for play.
Within the first few days of boot
camp, I realized that my former sense
of identity was largely based on my
social status, stripped of which I was a
mass of bone and muscle that re
quired a threshold amount of heat and

food to survive. This was a very differ
ent definition of humanity from the
one I had developed through my edu
cation at boarding school and Stan
ford and came as a great shock to me.
But what was more surprising was
that one got used to these conditions
and survived on the stale biscuits the
army gave out between brainwashing
sessions where we were trained to kill
North Koreans.
Some did not survive. On March
26, 2010, 46 soldiers drowned with
their ship that was hit by a North Ko
rean toipedo. In November 23 of the
same year two marines were killed by
artillery shelling of an island off the
western coast of Korea. I had been se
lected to be an interpreter after basic
infantry training and spent the rest of
my service behind a computer in the
headquarters of U.S. Forces Korea, at
the center of Seoul. My chances of
dying in combat were practically zero.
But attending funerals of soldiers my
age and witnessing man's helpless
ness at the cruelty of chance have
since instilled inside me a perennial
recognition of death that is like a fre
quency between silence and screech
that only certain animals can hear.
I hear it even as I write this in a
light-flooded room with the smell of
cut grass in the air. Last month, a
cruiser capsized off the southern
coast of Korea with 475 passengers on
board, 325 of whom were high school
students on a school trip. The captain
and the crew left the ship without giv
ing orders to escape, and most pas
sengers remained in their cabins, as
they were told when the ship started
tilting. At the moment of my writing,
282 have been confirmed dead and 22
bodies are still missing. Videos
recorded on the students' phones of
their last hours inside the ship have
been recovered from their corpses
and released by the media, but I don't
have the heart to watch them. I pause
wilting and try holding my breath as
long as possible. The pain of suffoca
tion is beyond my imagination.
The degree of empowerment one
receives at Stanford is almost super
human. Sometimes, looking at the
night sky from the Oval after a run, I
feel like I will outlast the stars. Sure
ly, part of the sense of invulnerability
has to do with youth itself. But it also
has to do with what Stanford strives
to teach us day by day: that the world
is ours to change and that we have
the power to change it. However,
when faced with events such as the
recent calamity in Korea, I find it dif
ficult to reconcile Stanford with the
rest of the world.
Stanford is not an accurate model
of the world. Things that we take for
granted here and I don't mean the
weather, but rather basic conditions
of life such as freedom from fear
are absent in the vast majority of the
world. Having left Stanford, we will
find that the knowledge of justice
does not make us immune to injus
tice. We will be victimized by chance
as much as others. The talk about de
signing one's life will not help us
against a tsunami or a brain tumor,
whose form life takes far more often

than a closed system where friction
and air resistance are assumed to not
exist.
Then what is the gift I take from
Stanford if not the preparation for
life after Stanford?
I have come to believe that the
purpose of higher education is not to
prepare one for life but rather to
show what life can be. As an interna
tional student, my education in
America as a whole has been a
process of learning what humanity is
capable of in abundance and free
dom. Despite what some may think,
America is a paradise compared to
most of the world, and out of the vast
expanse of her 50 states, Stanford
may be her epitome.
During my time here, as I wit
nessed Nobel-worthy discoveries
like optogenetics, milestones in gen
der equality and construction of won
ders like the Bing Performing Arts
Center, in the back of my mind there
was a constant recognition of what I
was seeing as a theory that must be
tested outside the gates of Stanford.
As graduation approaches, the sheer
brilliance of this place seems almost
unreal.
Some of us may choose never to
leave Stanford. In fact, a significant
percentage of alumni choose to re
main in the Bay Area. That is your

own decision to make. But to mistake
the theory of Stanford for reality
without testing it will only validate
the criticism that higher education
fosters an elitism that isolates one
from the rest of the world. You might
say that you do not want to have to do
anything with the rest of the world.
But you already know, from the one
time you were able to bring happi
ness to another person's life, that the
gift of life cannot be received in isola
tion, that the most profound experi
ences of our lives are those experi
enced in the plural though we
enter and leave this world alone.
I, too, do not know what life holds
for me. But to enable others to expe
rience the beauty that I experienced
here, to bring the theory of Stanford
into reality in places without light or
warmth that is my goal, and that
sense of purpose is the gift that I
take from Stanford. Take a moment
to appreciate the blessing that is
your life right now. Life after Stan
ford will be difficult. But you will re
member what happened here during
these years. Also, what you know to
be true. What you know is possible.

years in New England and my two

Korea after my freshman year a
difference marked not by uniqueness,
for no hour is experienced twice, but
by its unparalleled beauty.
Part of Stanford's beauty has to do
with personal history the events
that took place and the people I met
here a product of nostalgia that
can clothe the most mundane coinci

However, much of it has to do with a
kind of beauty that does not need in

self-evident even to the rabbits in
Lake Lag.
When I sit on the ledge of the foun
