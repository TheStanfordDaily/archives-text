# The
						theory of Stanford: a senior reflection

As I prepare to leave Stanford, I
have begun to make a mental
recording of all that I see, as a
sailor in the pre-photographic age
might have stared at the objects in his
room one last time before he em
barked on a voyage that may take half
his life. And under that light of dawn,
where every object reveals its true
form, I see that my time here has
been utterly different from my child
hood in Korea, my boarding school
years in New England and my two
years of military service back in
Korea after my freshman year a
difference marked not by uniqueness,
for no hour is experienced twice, but
by its unparalleled beauty.
Part of Stanford's beauty has to do
with personal history the events
that took place and the people I met
here a product of nostalgia that
can clothe the most mundane coinci
dences with the garments of fate.
However, much of it has to do with a
kind of beauty that does not need in
terpretation, an a prion perfection
self-evident even to the rabbits in
Lake Lag.
When I sit on the ledge of the foun
tain by the west entrance of Green Li
brary and watch the sunset brim over
the arches of the Main Quad, them
selves framed by a sky reminiscent of
a Rothko painting, I feel as if the heav
ens were made for me. It seems incon
ceivable that anything bad should
happen in this world. For a moment, I
feel invulnerable.
I know that this is an illusion. If my
military service in the Republic of
Korea Army during my two years of
leave from Stanford taught me any
thing, it was the fact that a human
being in essence is no different from a
dog that children can drown for play.
Within the first few days of boot
camp, I realized that my former sense
of identity was largely based on my
social status, stripped of which I was a
mass of bone and muscle that re
quired a threshold amount of heat and

food to survive. This was a very differ
ent definition of humanity from the
one I had developed through my edu
cation at boarding school and Stan
ford and came as a great shock to me.
But what was more surprising was
that one got used to these conditions
and survived on the stale biscuits the
army gave out between brainwashing
sessions where we were trained to kill
North Koreans.
Some did not survive. On March
26, 2010, 46 soldiers drowned with
their ship that was hit by a North Ko
rean toipedo. In November 23 of the
same year two marines were killed by
artillery shelling of an island off the
western coast of Korea. I had been se
lected to be an interpreter after basic
infantry training and spent the rest of
my service behind a computer in the
headquarters of U.S. Forces Korea, at
the center of Seoul. My chances of
dying in combat were practically zero.
But attending funerals of soldiers my
age and witnessing man's helpless
ness at the cruelty of chance have
since instilled inside me a perennial
recognition of death that is like a fre
quency between silence and screech
that only certain animals can hear.
I hear it even as I write this in a
light-flooded room with the smell of
cut grass in the air. Last month, a
cruiser capsized off the southern
coast of Korea with 475 passengers on
board, 325 of whom were high school
students on a school trip. The captain
and the crew left the ship without giv
ing orders to escape, and most pas
sengers remained in their cabins, as
they were told when the ship started
tilting. At the moment of my writing,
282 have been confirmed dead and 22
bodies are still missing. Videos
recorded on the students' phones of
their last hours inside the ship have
been recovered from their corpses
and released by the media, but I don't
have the heart to watch them. I pause
wilting and try holding my breath as
long as possible. The pain of suffoca
tion is beyond my imagination.
