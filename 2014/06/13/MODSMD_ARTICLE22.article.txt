						importance of being alone

During my second week of jun
ior year at Stanford, I found
myself alone at a dingy cafe in
Moscow drinking cheap Russian
compote, listening to the breathy
whir of the oven puffing heat into the
frigid air. Outside people were com
ing and going while my headphones
blasted The Beatles' "Eleanor
Rigby." All the lonely people/
Where do they all come from... ?
It suddenly hit me that it had been
a while since I had had the chance to
be alone, sitting midday lost in a sea
of foreignness, doing nothing. There
is something very precious about mo
ments like these moments of soli
tude, when one finds company in her
self, her thoughts freed from the In
ternet hive mind and allowed to wan
der about on its own. This is one rea
son why I had come all the way to
Moscow this fall: to have time alone.
Yes, solitude. That was what I had
been craving so desperately while I
had been at Stanford, so much so that
I decided I had to take a quarter off.
Two years at Stanford have taught
me that there is no place in the world
where it is harder to find time alone.
Much too often, there is no time to
breathe, let alone think. It is as if the
entire campus has been skillfully or
ganized to prevent feeling alone:
There is always a mixer somewhere
on campus, a party, a meeting or an
interview to go to. There is always
something, someplace to go to, and
we inundate our calendars to keep
loneliness at bay. There simply isn't
time nor reason to be alone.
For some of us, this tugging need
to be so mewhere doing something
has made us incapable of solitude. A
friend once confided to me that she
felt unbearably anxious and uncom
fortable every time she found herself
sitting alone. She refused to write her
papers in her own room, preferring
to do so at a friend's place, and she
would skip going to the dining halls if
she couldn't find a dinner buddy. The
equivocation of aloneness with loneli
ness has become so entrenched that
being alone is something to be avert
ed at all costs, as if there is anything
wrong with spending time with one
self.
In this age of hyper-connectivity,
averting aloneness has become all too
easy. With social media, everybody is
practically one degree apart: All it
takes is a Facebook message to find
oneself in somebody's company, if
only virtually. The News Feed and
other networking platforms have
made it possible to be privy to friends'

lives even if we have no part in them,
creating the illusion that we are
somewhat "connected" to the experi
ences of many distanced others. A
disturbing byproduct of being in con
stant company is that our minds, too,
are never alone: They buzz with
sound bites and opinions we conve
niently lay claim to by clicking
"share." So much for independent
thought. The canvassing of sound
bites through social networking
online and off is fast replacing sus
tained thought and introspection.
What happens when sociability
leaves little room for solitude? What
does it mean to be educated at a place
where you are never alone, and
where it takes enormous effort to
find solitude?
I think it means we are at risk of
losing an essential precondition for
thinking deeply, or living the intellec
tual life that a liberal arts education is
supposed to give us.
"In order to understand the
world," Albert Camus said, "one has
to turn away from it on occasion."
The same might be said of under
standing the self: If we are fearful of
finding ourselves alone, then it is like
ly that we will never find ourselves.
There has always been a tug of
war between the fear of loneliness
and the need for solitude. Our lan
guage wisely captures the two sides
of being alone we have the word
"loneliness" which carries with it the
reverberations of isolation and seclu
sion, and "solitude," which rings with
a quiet freedom and tranquility. The
former drives us into an endless
quest for company, at the expense of
time and space for solitude. At Stan
ford, the pressures to be constantly
networked and connected easily
eclipse the importance of being alone.
So amid the avalanche of emails
asking for your attendance at this
event and that event, take time to be
alone. Wake up at 8 a.m. when it is
dead quiet and savor the precious si
lence uninterrupted by crashing
bikes. Make yourself a cup of hot
chocolate to last through the book
you meant to read but never got to.
Grab that instrument you have neg
lected for too long. Go to Lake Lagu
nita before the sun sets, right down
into the middle of the lakebed, and
take a deep, deep breath. Feel the
freedom of solitude, weightless as
feathers. Put your gadgets away, be
uncontactable for a time your
friends will understand.
Because being alone is okay. And
if you came into college with the hope
of understanding the world and find
