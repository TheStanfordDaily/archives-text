Forget UCLA. Forget USC. Forget the
rest of the MPSF conference. Forget the idea
that Stanford women's water polo could be
felled for a second time this season.

Because on Sunday afternoon at the
Uytengsu Aquatic Center in Los Angeles,
there was simply no team in the country that
could have matched up with the No. 1 Cardi
nal in the pool not even No. 2 UCLA as
Stanford brought home the fourth national
championship in the program's history.
"We've had wins before, but it wasn't going
to mean anything unless we took them apart
today," said senior Kaley Dodson, who scored
two goals. "I'm super proud of everyone's per
formance. I was thinking about today, all the
wins in the last three and three-quarters of a
year wouldn't have mattered if we hadn't
won."
As the season progressed, the ultimate
matchup between the No. 1 Cardinal (25-1)
and No. 2 Brains (27-5) for all the marbles had
almost become a foregone conclusion. Al
though it had been the fearsome USC Trojans
that had started the season ranked as the top
team in the country after slipping past Stan
ford in a 10-9, quadruple-overtime heart
breaker in last season's national title match,

Stanford and UCLA firmly established them
selves at the top of the pack towards the end
of the season.

It was the fifth matchup of the year be
tween the two teams, with UCLA having won
the first to hand Stanford its only loss of the
season before the Cardinal won the next three
including a 6-5 nail biter in the MPSF title
match. Although Stanford had the advantage
in record, not many expected the win to come
easily, as had been the case in the teams' pre
vious three meetings.
"This championship game, in my mind,
started in February with the loss to UCLA,"
Stanford head coach John Tanner said. "We
owe them a lot for forcing us to get better.
They are a terrific team and they showed up
big-time today."
As has been the case throughout the sea
son, defense was the Cardinal's calling card
that ultimately netted them the trophy. Al
though the team as a whole including the
defense started slowly and fell behind
early, Stanford became absolutely airtight
throughout the second half and gave UCLA
no opportunities whatsoever to regain its foot
ing as the Cardinal roared back into the match
with seven unanswered goals.
"I'm really proud of this team," Tanner
said. "It seems like game after game we get
down and have to fight our way back, and so
much of that is 5-on-6, time after time making
those stops. The story of this team is that they
have been comprehensively unified, and
we've just had an incredible weekend down
here."
Although Stanford jumped out to a quick
1-0 lead on a goal from junior Ashley Gross
man, the Bruins were able to take advantage

of the opportunities that they had on the in
side a rarity against the stingy Cardinal
defense to jump out to a 5-2 lead with 19
seconds remaining in the first half on a goal
from sophomore Kodi Hill.
That was the last the Bruins would see of
the back of the net for the rest of the after
noon.
Stanford took advantage of a power play in
the waning seconds of the half with a buzzer
beater from sophomore Anna Yelizarova that
cut the UCLA lead to 5-3 heading into half
time the same deficit that the Cardinal had
faced at the break in the MPSF title match.
Slowly but surely, the tide was turning in
favor of the Cardinal.
"We set the second half up in the first half,"
Tanner said. "We get great contributions
from throughout our lineup, and that's what
we've been doing. And then we turn Kaley
loose on them. And we've turned a bunch of
games by turning her into a primary defend
er, which is an absolute lockdown. We can
press and we can counterattack, and that's
what turns games around."
With the defense coming out of the break
in full force, it didn't matter what UCLA
threw at it. It didn't matter how the Bruins at
tacked, nor did it matter if UCLA had a 6-on
-5 advantage. The Stanford defense buckled
down and stretched the Bruins offense out
throughout the pool, giving UCLA no oppor
tunities to move the ball around comfortably
or get the ball to the two-meter line for an
open look.
Field blocks, steals, saves from sophomore
goalkeeper Gabby Stone you name it,

After trailing 5-2 late in the first half, Stanford women's water polo stormed back to defeat UCLA 9-5 to clinch the NCAA title. The
Cardinal bounced back in emphatic fashion after losing to USC in last year's NCAA championship game, which saw five overtimes.
Stanford's defense was doing
it. The Bruins simply had no
answer. And as the defensive
tide turned, the offense start
ed to battle back and put the
Cardinal back into the match.
"I think our whole mindset
for the entire game was de
fense," senior Annika Dries
said. "I remember distinctly a
5-on-6 stop...those types of
stops are not only preventing
goals but giving our offense
momentum. I really think
that seeing key people step up
in those defensive moments
was really inspiring."

On both offense and de
fense, the second half was re
ally the Annika Dries show
for Stanford, as the senior
notched a hat trick while
closely guarding UCLA's
Emily Donohoe one of the
top attackers in the nation
and limiting the Brains' op
portunities on the inside. For
her efforts, Dries was named
the tournament's most valu
able player.
In the third period, the mo
mentum clearly swung in the
Cardinal's favor, as the de
fense successfully defended
three 5-on-6 opportunities for
the Bruins and the offense
first cut the lead to 5-4 on a
Dries goal from the two
meter line before Grossman
emphatically scored the
equalizer with time expiring
to knot the match at 5-5 head
ing into the fourth and final
quarter.
"The last quarter, there's a
lot of pressure," Dodson said.
"We were tied, and it was my
last eight minutes of water
polo, and I remember think
ing that I'd better leave it all
in the pool because it's my
last competitive game and
there's no stopping us for
sure."
With 4:51 remaining in
the match, Stanford finally
cashed in. After a Dodson
steal that wrested possession
away from the Bruins, Dries
used a perfectly placed shot
from the inside to give the
Cardinal its first lead since
the first period. Just 26 sec
onds later, Dodson took a
powerful shot from the out
side to pile on and give Stan
ford a 7-5 advantage.
Under a minute later,
Dodson knocked down anoth
er UCLA pass and the ball ul
timately ended up in the
hands of Steffens, who took
matters into her own hands
and effectively put the nail in
the Bruins' coffin by zipping
the ball into the bottom left
corner of the goal.
UCLA never had another
chance to start a comeback at
tempt, and when Dries
capped off her hat trick with a
breakaway goal with 48 sec

onds remaining, it was just
icing on the cake.
When it mattered most on
the biggest stage in collegiate
water polo, the Cardinal had
firmly established their domi
nance and added to their
loaded reign of dominance at
the forefront of the nation in
the sport. The coaches joined
the players in emphatically
jumping into the pool to cele
brate the victory.
Later, in the postgame
press conference, a member
of the media brought up the
idea of this Stanford team
being one of the best if not
the best ever.
Tanner, Dries and Dodson
just looked at each other and
laughed, almost innocently.
Because after 108 wins
and three national titles to
gether, everybody knew that
Sunday had been the pinna
cle for one of the few teams in
water polo history that could
lay legitimate claim to that
title. And on that afternoon,
they stood together atop the
collegiate water polo world
together, one final time.
