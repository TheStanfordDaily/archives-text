Over the past several years, Stanford men's
basketball has come tantalizingly close to upset
ting a handful of top teams: No. 5 Kentucky in
2009, No. 5 Syracuse in 2011 and No. 1 Arizona
in 2014.
This weekend in St. Louis, close just didn't
cut it for the Cardinal.
After holding off seventh-seeded New Mex
ico 58-53 on Friday, No. 10 seed Stanford (23-12,
10-8 Pac-12) turned the college basketball world
upside down on Sunday morning with a 60-57
win against second-seeded Kansas, punching a
ticket to the Sweet 16 for the fifth time in school
history.

Though the Jayhawks (25-10, 14-4 Big 12)
were without 7-foot freshman center Joel Em
biid, the Big 12 Conference Defensive Player of
the Year, the Cardinal still shut down one of the
nation's most dynamic scorers in freshman
guard Andrew Wiggins. Wiggins is perhaps the
top prospect in the upcoming NBA Draft, yet he
was limited to just 4 points fewer than the to
tals posted by each of Stanford's five starters.
"That was [senior forward] Josh Huestis's
assignment and he took it to heart," said Cardi
nal head coach Johnny Dawkins. "Then we had
help, of course. [Wiggins is] a guy you are not
going to guard with one player. I thought the
rest of our team was always aware of where he
was."
The team defense that Dawkins has
preached over his six-year tenure has taken
center stage in Stanford's first NCAA tourna
ment appearance since he became head coach,
with the Cardinal's 1-3-1 zone keeping Kansas
well below its season average of 79.6 points per
game. Just as important on Sunday were a solid
17 minutes off the bench by senior forward John
Gage, who had an uncharacteristically poor
shooting night (l-for-6, 0-for-4 from 3-point
range) but filled in when needed for senior big
men Dwight Powell and Stefan Nastic, who
each committed four fouls.
Yet for a Stanford team that has fought
through injuries to its depth players all year, the
Cardinal's stars needed to be at their best
against Kansas and they were.
On Saturday, Wiggins and fellow Jayhawks
guard Wayne Selden Jr. were asked about Stan
ford junior guard Chasson Randle, the Pac-12's
second-leading scorer. They responded by gig
gling and then avoiding the question, apparent
ly not knowing who Randle was.
