# CARD STUN KANSAS, ON TO SWEET 16

Over the past several years, Stanford men's
basketball has come tantalizingly close to upset
ting a handful of top teams: No. 5 Kentucky in
2009, No. 5 Syracuse in 2011 and No. 1 Arizona
in 2014.
This weekend in St. Louis, close just didn't
cut it for the Cardinal.
After holding off seventh-seeded New Mex
ico 58-53 on Friday, No. 10 seed Stanford (23-12,
10-8 Pac-12) turned the college basketball world
upside down on Sunday morning with a 60-57
win against second-seeded Kansas, punching a
ticket to the Sweet 16 for the fifth time in school
history.

Though the Jayhawks (25-10, 14-4 Big 12)
were without 7-foot freshman center Joel Em
biid, the Big 12 Conference Defensive Player of
the Year, the Cardinal still shut down one of the
nation's most dynamic scorers in freshman
guard Andrew Wiggins. Wiggins is perhaps the
top prospect in the upcoming NBA Draft, yet he
was limited to just 4 points fewer than the to
tals posted by each of Stanford's five starters.
"That was [senior forward] Josh Huestis's
assignment and he took it to heart," said Cardi
nal head coach Johnny Dawkins. "Then we had
help, of course. [Wiggins is] a guy you are not
going to guard with one player. I thought the
rest of our team was always aware of where he
was."
The team defense that Dawkins has
preached over his six-year tenure has taken
center stage in Stanford's first NCAA tourna
ment appearance since he became head coach,
with the Cardinal's 1-3-1 zone keeping Kansas
well below its season average of 79.6 points per
game. Just as important on Sunday were a solid
17 minutes off the bench by senior forward John
Gage, who had an uncharacteristically poor
shooting night (l-for-6, 0-for-4 from 3-point
range) but filled in when needed for senior big
men Dwight Powell and Stefan Nastic, who
each committed four fouls.
Yet for a Stanford team that has fought
through injuries to its depth players all year, the
Cardinal's stars needed to be at their best
against Kansas and they were.
On Saturday, Wiggins and fellow Jayhawks
guard Wayne Selden Jr. were asked about Stan
ford junior guard Chasson Randle, the Pac-12's
second-leading scorer. They responded by gig
gling and then avoiding the question, apparent
ly not knowing who Randle was.

Randle responded by playing all
40 minutes on Sunday, scoring 13
points and grabbing 6 steals.

"I definitely took it as a chal
lenge," Randle said of Wiggins and
Selden's comments. "So did my
teammates. It wasn't just a stab at
me, it was a stab at our team. And
we took it as a challenge. And it was
a little bit extra motivation for
today's game."

Stanford's other first-team All-
Pac-12 representative, Powell,
made his presence felt as well.
Though he struggled with foul trou
ble for the second consecutive
game, Powell led the Cardinal in
scoring with 15 points and bounced
back from an 0-for-8 showing from

the field against New Mexico. He
and Huestis combined for 15 re
bounds, and though Kansas for
ward Tarik Black was able to rack
up a game-high 18 points, the Cardi
nal eventually won the physical bat
tle down low and Black fouled out
late in the game.
"We definitely spend a lot of
time talking about and preparing
for their bigs, and the way they like
to attack the rim," Powell said. "It
was definitely one of our focuses to
just be physical and have guys in
the lane and be ready to help be
cause they were quick on drives."
Stanford hung tough with
Kansas in the early going, eventual
ly building an 18-11 lead with 9:31
left in the first half. But that's as
large as the Cardinal's advantage
would get in the opening frame, and
a turnover on the final possession of
the first half allowed Conner
Frankamp to sink a 3 at the buzzer

to give the Jayhawks a 24-22 lead,

Kansas would erase another
seven-point Stanford lead in the
second half with a suffocating full
court press, and a Perry Ellis dunk
knotted the game up at 49 with five
minutes left. On the Cardinal's next
trip down the court, Powell, with
four fouls, drove into the key and
willed it home with one hand to put
Stanford back on top.
Riding a one-possession lead
into the final minute, the Cardinal
turned to their veterans to finish off
a Kansas team that started three
underclassmen and had lost its
lone starting senior, the fouled-out
Black. A Wiggins turnover and a
missed Kansas layup sent Powell
and forward Anthony Brown to the
line six times, and the seniors deliv
ered with five made free throws to
make it 58-51.
The Jayhawks weren't done just
yet. Frankamp sunk two desperate
3-pointers, sandwiched around an
other Brown free throw, to cut the
Cardinal's lead to just two points
with 18 seconds remaining.
Brown's sixth free throw of the
night gave Stanford a three-point
cushion at 60-57 with 13 seconds left
before he missed the second at
tempt. But Frankamp's final prayer
missed wide and bounced straight
to Powell with just a second remain
ing, and the Cardinal moved on to
the Sweet Sixteen despite shooting
0-for-9 from 3-point range and los
ing the turnover battle.
"Every season is like a lifetime,"
Powell said. "Obviously you will
have your ups and downs through
out different games and throughout
different stretches of games. But
from day one before we even start
ed preseason we always had a goal
to make the tournament and to
make a run. And we never lost sight
of that and never lost hope, and we
never stopped fighting for that
every single game regardless of
how things were going."
Though the Cardinal certainly
played the Cinderella in Sunday's
dogfight, they will actually be the
favorites in their Sweet 16 matchup
against No. 11 seed Dayton, which
advanced by upsetting sixth-seeded
Ohio State and third-seeded Syra
cuse by a combined three points.
Should Stanford win that game,
which tips off in Memphis at 4:15
p.m. PDT on Thursday, it would face
either No. 1 seed Florida or No. 4
seed UCLA with a spot in the Final
Four on the line. The Cardinal
haven't reached the Elite Eight
since 2001, and its only Final Four
appearance came in 1998.

game. Just as important on Sunday were a solid
17 minutes off the bench by senior forward John
Gage, who had an uncharacteristically poor
shooting night (l-for-6, 0-for-4 from 3-point
range) but filled in when needed for senior big
men Dwight Powell and Stefan Nastic, who
each committed four fouls.
Yet for a Stanford team that has fought
through injuries to its depth players all year, the
Cardinal's stars needed to be at their best
against Kansas and they were.
On Saturday, Wiggins and fellow Jayhawks
guard Wayne Selden Jr. were asked about Stan
ford junior guard Chasson Randle, the Pac-12's
second-leading scorer. They responded by gig
gling and then avoiding the question, apparent
ly not knowing who Randle was.

Randle responded by playing all
40 minutes on Sunday, scoring 13
points and grabbing 6 steals.

"I definitely took it as a chal
lenge," Randle said of Wiggins and
Selden's comments. "So did my
teammates. It wasn't just a stab at
me, it was a stab at our team. And
we took it as a challenge. And it was
a little bit extra motivation for
today's game."

Stanford's other first-team All-
Pac-12 representative, Powell,
made his presence felt as well.
Though he struggled with foul trou
ble for the second consecutive
game, Powell led the Cardinal in
scoring with 15 points and bounced
back from an 0-for-8 showing from

the field against New Mexico. He
and Huestis combined for 15 re
bounds, and though Kansas for
ward Tarik Black was able to rack
up a game-high 18 points, the Cardi
nal eventually won the physical bat
tle down low and Black fouled out
late in the game.
"We definitely spend a lot of
time talking about and preparing
for their bigs, and the way they like
to attack the rim," Powell said. "It
was definitely one of our focuses to
just be physical and have guys in
the lane and be ready to help be
cause they were quick on drives."
Stanford hung tough with
Kansas in the early going, eventual
ly building an 18-11 lead with 9:31
left in the first half. But that's as
large as the Cardinal's advantage
would get in the opening frame, and
a turnover on the final possession of
the first half allowed Conner
Frankamp to sink a 3 at the buzzer

to give the Jayhawks a 24-22 lead,

Kansas would erase another
seven-point Stanford lead in the
second half with a suffocating full
court press, and a Perry Ellis dunk
knotted the game up at 49 with five
minutes left. On the Cardinal's next
trip down the court, Powell, with
four fouls, drove into the key and
willed it home with one hand to put
Stanford back on top.
Riding a one-possession lead
into the final minute, the Cardinal
turned to their veterans to finish off
a Kansas team that started three
underclassmen and had lost its
lone starting senior, the fouled-out
Black. A Wiggins turnover and a
missed Kansas layup sent Powell
and forward Anthony Brown to the
line six times, and the seniors deliv
ered with five made free throws to
make it 58-51.
The Jayhawks weren't done just
yet. Frankamp sunk two desperate
3-pointers, sandwiched around an
other Brown free throw, to cut the
Cardinal's lead to just two points
with 18 seconds remaining.
Brown's sixth free throw of the
night gave Stanford a three-point
cushion at 60-57 with 13 seconds left
before he missed the second at
tempt. But Frankamp's final prayer
missed wide and bounced straight
to Powell with just a second remain
ing, and the Cardinal moved on to
the Sweet Sixteen despite shooting
0-for-9 from 3-point range and los
ing the turnover battle.
"Every season is like a lifetime,"
Powell said. "Obviously you will
have your ups and downs through
out different games and throughout
different stretches of games. But
from day one before we even start
ed preseason we always had a goal
to make the tournament and to
make a run. And we never lost sight
of that and never lost hope, and we
never stopped fighting for that
every single game regardless of
how things were going."
Though the Cardinal certainly
played the Cinderella in Sunday's
dogfight, they will actually be the
favorites in their Sweet 16 matchup
against No. 11 seed Dayton, which
advanced by upsetting sixth-seeded
Ohio State and third-seeded Syra
cuse by a combined three points.
Should Stanford win that game,
which tips off in Memphis at 4:15
p.m. PDT on Thursday, it would face
either No. 1 seed Florida or No. 4
seed UCLA with a spot in the Final
Four on the line. The Cardinal
haven't reached the Elite Eight
since 2001, and its only Final Four
appearance came in 1998.

NCAA tournament. Stanford would fall to Dayton in the Sweet 16.

Over the past several years, Stanford men's
basketball has come tantalizingly close to upset
ting a handful of top teams: No. 5 Kentucky in
2009, No. 5 Syracuse in 2011 and No. 1 Arizona
in 2014.
This weekend in St. Louis, close just didn't
cut it for the Cardinal.
After holding off seventh-seeded New Mex
ico 58-53 on Friday, No. 10 seed Stanford (23-12,
10-8 Pac-12) turned the college basketball world
upside down on Sunday morning with a 60-57
win against second-seeded Kansas, punching a
ticket to the Sweet 16 for the fifth time in school
history.

Though the Jayhawks (25-10, 14-4 Big 12)
were without 7-foot freshman center Joel Em
biid, the Big 12 Conference Defensive Player of
the Year, the Cardinal still shut down one of the
nation's most dynamic scorers in freshman
guard Andrew Wiggins. Wiggins is perhaps the
top prospect in the upcoming NBA Draft, yet he
was limited to just 4 points fewer than the to
tals posted by each of Stanford's five starters.
"That was [senior forward] Josh Huestis's
assignment and he took it to heart," said Cardi
nal head coach Johnny Dawkins. "Then we had
help, of course. [Wiggins is] a guy you are not
going to guard with one player. I thought the
rest of our team was always aware of where he
was."
The team defense that Dawkins has
preached over his six-year tenure has taken
center stage in Stanford's first NCAA tourna
ment appearance since he became head coach,
with the Cardinal's 1-3-1 zone keeping Kansas
well below its season average of 79.6 points per
game. Just as important on Sunday were a solid
