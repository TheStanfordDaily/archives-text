Annie Robinson turns 10 next
month, but her dad will be on a busi
ness trip that night. The Southern
Utah men's basketball team will be
in Missoula, Mont., and Pops has a
game to coach.
If you follow Stanford basket
ball, you probably don't know much
about the Thunderbirds. Yet you
have heard of Annie, maybe by a dif
ferent name, the one that broad
casters Brent Musburger and Dick
Vitale proposed on national televi
sion 10 years ago today.
"Buzzer-beater."
Some call it "The Miracle at
Maples"; others, simply "The Shot."
But when Nick Robinson 'O4 M.A.
'O5 sunk a 35-foot runner as time ex
pired to give No. 2 Stanford an 80-77
win against No. 12 Arizona send
ing Musburger and Vitale into hys
terics, the Sixth Man Club onto the
Maples Pavilion hardwood and the
Cardinal to a 20-0 record there
were, in truth, no words to describe
what had just happened.
Ten years after Robinson's icon
ic shot, that has changed.
"As a huge Stanford fan in pretty
much any sport, this was one of the
greatest games I've ever been to,"
Tiger Woods told The Daily through
his agent last month. "To come back
like that, and with that type of shot,
is something I'll never forget."
"It's one of the best finishes I've
ever seen," added Heisman Trophy
winner and Super Bowl MVP Jim
Plunkett, who sat behind Woods at
the game. "It goes down with the
great Stanford historic moments."
The moment itself has lingered
in the memories of Cardinal fans for
a decade, and it has stuck with mem

bers of the 2003-04 hoops team as
well. Rob Little 'O5, then Stanford's
starting center, has a framed photo
in his house of Robinson shooting
the ball; Josh Childress 'O5, the
team's star forward and a seven
year NBA veteran, still gets chills

watching that clip.
But the story of Feb. 7, 2004, is
not just one of an improbable steal
and an impossible shot. It's one of a
fierce West Coast rivalry, hitting its
unforgettable zenith; of a basket
ball-frenzied campus, converging

on its beloved stomping grounds for
one final season; of a 24-year-old
utility player, at once the odd man
out and his team's most respected
member; and of a group of 14 con
ference champion teammates, the
likes of which haven't been seen on

the Farm since.

On Feb. 7, 2004, forward Nick Robinson (21) hit a 35-foot runner as time expired to propel No. 2 Stanford past No. 12 Arizona 80-77 in what is
perhaps the most exciting game in Stanford basketball history. Notable Stanford alumni, including Tiger Woods and Jim Plunkett, attended the game
and witnessed Robinson's heroic buzzer-beater. Robinson is currently the men's basketball head coach at Southern Utah University.
