Annie Robinson turns 10 next
month, but her dad will be on a busi
ness trip that night. The Southern
Utah men's basketball team will be
in Missoula, Mont., and Pops has a
game to coach.
If you follow Stanford basket
ball, you probably don't know much
about the Thunderbirds. Yet you
have heard of Annie, maybe by a dif
ferent name, the one that broad
casters Brent Musburger and Dick
Vitale proposed on national televi
sion 10 years ago today.
"Buzzer-beater."
Some call it "The Miracle at
Maples"; others, simply "The Shot."
But when Nick Robinson 'O4 M.A.
'O5 sunk a 35-foot runner as time ex
pired to give No. 2 Stanford an 80-77
win against No. 12 Arizona send
ing Musburger and Vitale into hys
terics, the Sixth Man Club onto the
Maples Pavilion hardwood and the
Cardinal to a 20-0 record there
were, in truth, no words to describe
what had just happened.
Ten years after Robinson's icon
ic shot, that has changed.
"As a huge Stanford fan in pretty
much any sport, this was one of the
greatest games I've ever been to,"
Tiger Woods told The Daily through
his agent last month. "To come back
like that, and with that type of shot,
is something I'll never forget."
"It's one of the best finishes I've
ever seen," added Heisman Trophy
winner and Super Bowl MVP Jim
Plunkett, who sat behind Woods at
the game. "It goes down with the
great Stanford historic moments."
The moment itself has lingered
in the memories of Cardinal fans for
a decade, and it has stuck with mem

bers of the 2003-04 hoops team as
well. Rob Little 'O5, then Stanford's
starting center, has a framed photo
in his house of Robinson shooting
the ball; Josh Childress 'O5, the
team's star forward and a seven
year NBA veteran, still gets chills

watching that clip.
But the story of Feb. 7, 2004, is
not just one of an improbable steal
and an impossible shot. It's one of a
fierce West Coast rivalry, hitting its
unforgettable zenith; of a basket
ball-frenzied campus, converging

on its beloved stomping grounds for
one final season; of a 24-year-old
utility player, at once the odd man
out and his team's most respected
member; and of a group of 14 con
ference champion teammates, the
likes of which haven't been seen on

the Farm since.

On Feb. 7, 2004, forward Nick Robinson (21) hit a 35-foot runner as time expired to propel No. 2 Stanford past No. 12 Arizona 80-77 in what is
perhaps the most exciting game in Stanford basketball history. Notable Stanford alumni, including Tiger Woods and Jim Plunkett, attended the game
and witnessed Robinson's heroic buzzer-beater. Robinson is currently the men's basketball head coach at Southern Utah University.
partures Jason and Jarron
Collins, Casey Jacobsen and Curtis
Borchardt in two years. That old
guard had set a new standard for
Cardinal men's basketball under
head coach Mike Montgomery,
starting the 2000-01 season 20-0,
holding the No. 1 spot for much of
that year and reaching the Elite
Eight.
Facing a significant experience
gap entering the 2002-03 season,
Stanford was picked to finish sev
enth in the Pac-10. But instead of
going their separate ways for the
summer, as most college players did
at the time, the entire Cardinal ros
ter stayed on campus to train. They
had seen an earlier generation of
teammates make Stanford an elite
college basketball program, and
they wanted to do the same. The
team finished second, and the next
summer, it followed the same rou
tine to prepare for the 2003-04 sea
son.

"We felt that we had the talent to
[return to the top]," says the team's
junior point guard, Chris Hernan
dez 'O5 M.A. 'O6. "We held each
other accountable, people calling
people up if they didn't show up for
a voluntary workout and whatnot."
"Everyone was the one guy try
ing to play the hardest in practice
every day," adds Joe Kirchofer 'O3,
one of the team's three captains. "It
wasn't just one of us; it was every
body trying to set that tone, which
made it really fun."
Most important was a lack of ego
from Stanford's top players, includ
ing from the most talented of them
all, Childress.
"Our best players wanted the
team to be successful more than
they wanted themselves to be suc
cessful," Kirchofer says. "I think
Josh Childress deserves a ton of
credit for the way that we all ap
proached the team and the way that
we were able to work together so ef
fectively."
Though Childress was just
months away from being selected
sixth overall in the NBA draft
higher than any other player in
Stanford history the talented
forward brought a calm focus to
Cardinal practices.
The vocal leadership was left to
Kirchofer and guard Matt Lottich
'O4, a deadly 3-point shooter and the
team's second-leading scorer. He
was the team's most competitive
player, and unlike Childress, he let it
show.
"The guy was in your face, talk
ing smack in your practice, kind of
getting people rough," Hernandez
remembers. "Sometimes you're
going through practices and you're
working hard, but your mind might
not be really there. You're thinking
about the 20-page paper you have to
write later that night or all the dif
ferent stuff that goes on at school.
And sometimes you get someone
who can sense that. They get in your
face, they get you focused, get you
mad so that you want to really com
pete and beat that person.
"But you can't have five people
who are like that," he adds, "because
you would never get anything done.
Everyone would just be yelling at
each other all the time."
The Childress-Lottich foil exem
plified the team's diverse personali
ties. There was the philosophical
Little, a 6-foot-10 center whose
opinions were as thoughtful as his
name was ironic; Justin Davis, a
comedic big man who could lighten
the mood in an instant; and Kir
chofer, a fifth-year leader whose
positive attitude and work ethic had
made him a primary backup over a
long career. Setting the tone on the
court was Hernandez, who returned
after breaking his foot twice and
missing the entire 2002-03 season,
instantly making the Cardinal bet
ter with his mistake-free play and
ability to read the game.
Nick Robinson wasn't an injury
hardened vet, a future NBA talent
or even a trash-talker, but in this
cast of characters, it was he who
stood out. Robinson had originally
signed with Stanford in 1997, but he
took two years off for a Mormon
mission in Brazil, where he kept in
practice by playing against his fel

low missionaries on an outdoor
court. When Robinson finally made
it to the Farm, he was as old as the
team's juniors.
"I had never met Nick, but I was
really excited because we were two
freshmen coming into the team,"
Lottich remembers. "And all of a
sudden, he's on campus saying
things like, 'Yeah, I got married last
week.' Our lives were very different,
very quickly."
Instead of living in the dorms,
Robinson and his wife Meagan
moved into the on-campus couples
housing in Escondido Village. By
the start of the 2003-04 season, Nick
was the oldest player on the team
even though he was just a junior
athletically.
"He could've been living on the
moon, his lifestyle was so different
than ours," Kirchofer says. "But his
wife was pregnant and we were
super-excited, like the whole team
was getting a little brother or some
thing.
"A little sister, as it were."
Annie was due on March 1,2004.
Robinson's teammates started call
ing him 'Pops.'
Despite his family responsibili
ties, Robinson was no outcast. His
perspective may have been differ
ent, but Lottich remembers that it
kept the team even-keeled, and
Childress says that Robinson's
opinions were always valued highly.
The team even saw Meagan's home
cooked meals as a chance to get
away from the college lifestyle.
"I've played a lot of basketball
since then and I've coached basket
ball, and I haven't really been a part
of a locker room that was that tight,"
Lottich says. "I haven't been part of
a group of guys that I trust more,
both on and off the court, than that
group ... There's no doubt in my
mind that if one of them calls me
right now and needs something, I'd
be on the next plane out. It was that
special."
On the court, Robinson was the
final, invaluable piece in the Cardi
nal puzzle. He was usually listed as a
forward, but he played all over the
floor, guarding different positions,
creating steals and contributing a
few buckets a game —in Robin
son's own words, doing whatever he
could to help.
And the Cardinal needed all the
help it could get early in the season,
with Childress out for over a month
with a stress reaction in his foot. But
Stanford rolled through nonconfer
ence play, knocking off then-No. 1
Kansas in a win that shocked every
one but the Cardinal. The team
amassed a 9-0 record and rose to
No. 5 in the country before Chil
dress' return for the Pac-10 opener.
"We felt like that with him and
with everybody at full strength, we
would be poised for a really special
season," Robinson says.
Slowly but surely, Childress
made his way back onto the court:
seven minutes against Washington
State, 13 against Washington, 26 at
Arizona State. 9-0 became 10-0, and
11-0 became 12-0.
Childress' first start of the sea
son came in the Cardinal's sixth con
ference game, a 67-52 thrashing of
UCLA. 15-0. Suddenly, Stanford
was one of just two undefeated
teams in the country. 16-0. 17-0.
Questions about the streak started
flowing in.
"On a team like this it's impossi
ble to have things not occur to you,
because all the sportswriters need
something to write about," Kir
chofer says. "We knew we had a
chance to do something really spe
cial, but there was never any
thought that we had done some
thing special. It was all a work in
progress."
Second-ranked Stanford rolled
into Eugene, Ore., on Jan. 31 with
out the services of Davis, who had
hurt his knee in win number 17, and
for the first time all year, the Cardi
nal wasn't able to pick up the slack.
A middling Oregon team jumped
out to a 45-26 lead. Nothing was
working; Childress was having an
off night, Robinson was l-of-8 from
the field and Little played just five
minutes due to foul trouble.
Stanford called timeout.
"Nobody was in there talking
about, 'Oh, what if we're not unde
feated tomorrow,"' Kirchofer re
members. "It was more just about
getting it done."
"I remember our assistant
coach, Russell Turner, just got in my
face and started ripping me a new
one," Hernandez says. "Obviously
I'm paraphrasing, but, 'When are
you going to play? You going to start
playing?"'
That's when the Cardinal's point
guard, its self-proclaimed distribu
tor, flipped the switch. Hernandez
became aggressive, driving time
and time again, making trip after
trip to the free-throw line. All 22 of
his points came after halftime, and
with the help of 19 points from
Davis' replacement, sophomore
Matt Haryasz, the Cardinal escaped
83-80.
Halfway through the conference
season, Stanford was still undefeat
ed. The phoenix had taken flight.

team to be successful more than
they wanted themselves to be suc
cessful," Kirchofer says. "I think
Josh Childress deserves a ton of
credit for the way that we all ap
proached the team and the way that
we were able to work together so ef
fectively."
Though Childress was just
months away from being selected
sixth overall in the NBA draft
higher than any other player in
Stanford history the talented
forward brought a calm focus to
Cardinal practices.
The vocal leadership was left to
Kirchofer and guard Matt Lottich
'O4, a deadly 3-point shooter and the
team's second-leading scorer. He
was the team's most competitive
player, and unlike Childress, he let it
show.
"The guy was in your face, talk
ing smack in your practice, kind of
getting people rough," Hernandez
remembers. "Sometimes you're
going through practices and you're
working hard, but your mind might
not be really there. You're thinking
about the 20-page paper you have to
write later that night or all the dif
ferent stuff that goes on at school.
And sometimes you get someone
who can sense that. They get in your
face, they get you focused, get you
mad so that you want to really com
pete and beat that person.
"But you can't have five people
who are like that," he adds, "because
you would never get anything done.
Everyone would just be yelling at
each other all the time."
The Childress-Lottich foil exem
plified the team's diverse personali
ties. There was the philosophical
Little, a 6-foot-10 center whose
opinions were as thoughtful as his
name was ironic; Justin Davis, a
comedic big man who could lighten
the mood in an instant; and Kir
chofer, a fifth-year leader whose
positive attitude and work ethic had
made him a primary backup over a
long career. Setting the tone on the
court was Hernandez, who returned
after breaking his foot twice and
missing the entire 2002-03 season,
instantly making the Cardinal bet
ter with his mistake-free play and
ability to read the game.
Nick Robinson wasn't an injury
hardened vet, a future NBA talent
or even a trash-talker, but in this
cast of characters, it was he who
stood out. Robinson had originally
signed with Stanford in 1997, but he
took two years off for a Mormon
mission in Brazil, where he kept in
practice by playing against his fel

low missionaries on an outdoor
court. When Robinson finally made
it to the Farm, he was as old as the
team's juniors.
"I had never met Nick, but I was
really excited because we were two
freshmen coming into the team,"
Lottich remembers. "And all of a
sudden, he's on campus saying
things like, 'Yeah, I got married last
week.' Our lives were very different,
very quickly."
Instead of living in the dorms,
Robinson and his wife Meagan
moved into the on-campus couples
housing in Escondido Village. By
the start of the 2003-04 season, Nick
was the oldest player on the team
even though he was just a junior
athletically.
"He could've been living on the
moon, his lifestyle was so different
than ours," Kirchofer says. "But his
wife was pregnant and we were
super-excited, like the whole team
was getting a little brother or some
thing.
"A little sister, as it were."
Annie was due on March 1,2004.
Robinson's teammates started call
ing him 'Pops.'
Despite his family responsibili
ties, Robinson was no outcast. His
perspective may have been differ
ent, but Lottich remembers that it
kept the team even-keeled, and
Childress says that Robinson's
opinions were always valued highly.
The team even saw Meagan's home
cooked meals as a chance to get
away from the college lifestyle.
"I've played a lot of basketball
since then and I've coached basket
ball, and I haven't really been a part
of a locker room that was that tight,"
Lottich says. "I haven't been part of
a group of guys that I trust more,
both on and off the court, than that
group ... There's no doubt in my
mind that if one of them calls me
right now and needs something, I'd
be on the next plane out. It was that
special."
On the court, Robinson was the
final, invaluable piece in the Cardi
nal puzzle. He was usually listed as a
forward, but he played all over the
floor, guarding different positions,
creating steals and contributing a
few buckets a game —in Robin
son's own words, doing whatever he
could to help.
And the Cardinal needed all the
help it could get early in the season,
with Childress out for over a month
with a stress reaction in his foot. But
Stanford rolled through nonconfer
ence play, knocking off then-No. 1
Kansas in a win that shocked every
one but the Cardinal. The team
amassed a 9-0 record and rose to
No. 5 in the country before Chil
dress' return for the Pac-10 opener.
"We felt like that with him and
with everybody at full strength, we
would be poised for a really special
season," Robinson says.
Slowly but surely, Childress
made his way back onto the court:
seven minutes against Washington
State, 13 against Washington, 26 at
Arizona State. 9-0 became 10-0, and
11-0 became 12-0.
Childress' first start of the sea
son came in the Cardinal's sixth con
ference game, a 67-52 thrashing of
UCLA. 15-0. Suddenly, Stanford
was one of just two undefeated
teams in the country. 16-0. 17-0.
Questions about the streak started
flowing in.
"On a team like this it's impossi
ble to have things not occur to you,
because all the sportswriters need
something to write about," Kir
chofer says. "We knew we had a
chance to do something really spe
cial, but there was never any
thought that we had done some
thing special. It was all a work in
progress."
Second-ranked Stanford rolled
into Eugene, Ore., on Jan. 31 with
out the services of Davis, who had
hurt his knee in win number 17, and
for the first time all year, the Cardi
nal wasn't able to pick up the slack.
A middling Oregon team jumped
out to a 45-26 lead. Nothing was
working; Childress was having an
off night, Robinson was l-of-8 from
the field and Little played just five
minutes due to foul trouble.
Stanford called timeout.
"Nobody was in there talking
about, 'Oh, what if we're not unde
feated tomorrow,"' Kirchofer re
members. "It was more just about
getting it done."
"I remember our assistant
coach, Russell Turner, just got in my
face and started ripping me a new
one," Hernandez says. "Obviously
I'm paraphrasing, but, 'When are
you going to play? You going to start
playing?"'
That's when the Cardinal's point
guard, its self-proclaimed distribu
tor, flipped the switch. Hernandez
became aggressive, driving time
and time again, making trip after
trip to the free-throw line. All 22 of
his points came after halftime, and
with the help of 19 points from
Davis' replacement, sophomore
Matt Haryasz, the Cardinal escaped
83-80.
Halfway through the conference
season, Stanford was still undefeat
ed. The phoenix had taken flight.

MATT LOTTICH 'O4
Guard
Originally published, on Feb. 7,
201b.
Annie Robinson turns 10 next
month, but her dad will be on a busi
ness trip that night. The Southern
Utah men's basketball team will be
in Missoula, Mont., and Pops has a
game to coach.
If you follow Stanford basket
ball, you probably don't know much
about the Thunderbirds. Yet you
have heard of Annie, maybe by a dif
ferent name, the one that broad
casters Brent Musburger and Dick
Vitale proposed on national televi
sion 10 years ago today.
"Buzzer-beater."
Some call it "The Miracle at
Maples"; others, simply "The Shot."
But when Nick Robinson 'O4 M.A.
'O5 sunk a 35-foot runner as time ex
pired to give No. 2 Stanford an 80-77
win against No. 12 Arizona send
ing Musburger and Vitale into hys
terics, the Sixth Man Club onto the
Maples Pavilion hardwood and the
Cardinal to a 20-0 record there
were, in truth, no words to describe
what had just happened.
Ten years after Robinson's icon
ic shot, that has changed.
"As a huge Stanford fan in pretty
much any sport, this was one of the
greatest games I've ever been to,"
Tiger Woods told The Daily through
his agent last month. "To come back
like that, and with that type of shot,
is something I'll never forget."
"It's one of the best finishes I've
ever seen," added Heisman Trophy
winner and Super Bowl MVP Jim
Plunkett, who sat behind Woods at
the game. "It goes down with the
great Stanford historic moments."
The moment itself has lingered
in the memories of Cardinal fans for
a decade, and it has stuck with mem

bers of the 2003-04 hoops team as
well. Rob Little 'O5, then Stanford's
starting center, has a framed photo
in his house of Robinson shooting
the ball; Josh Childress 'O5, the
team's star forward and a seven
year NBA veteran, still gets chills

watching that clip.
But the story of Feb. 7, 2004, is
not just one of an improbable steal
and an impossible shot. It's one of a
fierce West Coast rivalry, hitting its
unforgettable zenith; of a basket
ball-frenzied campus, converging

on its beloved stomping grounds for
one final season; of a 24-year-old
utility player, at once the odd man
out and his team's most respected
member; and of a group of 14 con
ference champion teammates, the
likes of which haven't been seen on

the Farm since.

On Feb. 7, 2004, forward Nick Robinson (21) hit a 35-foot runner as time expired to propel No. 2 Stanford past No. 12 Arizona 80-77 in what is
perhaps the most exciting game in Stanford basketball history. Notable Stanford alumni, including Tiger Woods and Jim Plunkett, attended the game
and witnessed Robinson's heroic buzzer-beater. Robinson is currently the men's basketball head coach at Southern Utah University.
partures Jason and Jarron
Collins, Casey Jacobsen and Curtis
Borchardt in two years. That old
guard had set a new standard for
Cardinal men's basketball under
head coach Mike Montgomery,
starting the 2000-01 season 20-0,
holding the No. 1 spot for much of
that year and reaching the Elite
Eight.
Facing a significant experience
gap entering the 2002-03 season,
Stanford was picked to finish sev
enth in the Pac-10. But instead of
going their separate ways for the
summer, as most college players did
at the time, the entire Cardinal ros
ter stayed on campus to train. They
had seen an earlier generation of
teammates make Stanford an elite
college basketball program, and
they wanted to do the same. The
team finished second, and the next
summer, it followed the same rou
tine to prepare for the 2003-04 sea
son.

"We felt that we had the talent to
[return to the top]," says the team's
junior point guard, Chris Hernan
dez 'O5 M.A. 'O6. "We held each
other accountable, people calling
people up if they didn't show up for
a voluntary workout and whatnot."
"Everyone was the one guy try
ing to play the hardest in practice
every day," adds Joe Kirchofer 'O3,
one of the team's three captains. "It
wasn't just one of us; it was every
body trying to set that tone, which
made it really fun."
Most important was a lack of ego
from Stanford's top players, includ
ing from the most talented of them
all, Childress.
"Our best players wanted the
team to be successful more than
they wanted themselves to be suc
cessful," Kirchofer says. "I think
Josh Childress deserves a ton of
credit for the way that we all ap
proached the team and the way that
we were able to work together so ef
fectively."
Though Childress was just
months away from being selected
sixth overall in the NBA draft
higher than any other player in
Stanford history the talented
forward brought a calm focus to
Cardinal practices.
The vocal leadership was left to
Kirchofer and guard Matt Lottich
'O4, a deadly 3-point shooter and the
team's second-leading scorer. He
was the team's most competitive
player, and unlike Childress, he let it

one but the Cardinal. The team
amassed a 9-0 record and rose to
No. 5 in the country before Chil
dress' return for the Pac-10 opener.
"We felt like that with him and
with everybody at full strength, we
would be poised for a really special
season," Robinson says.
Slowly but surely, Childress
made his way back onto the court:
seven minutes against Washington
State, 13 against Washington, 26 at
Arizona State. 9-0 became 10-0, and
11-0 became 12-0.
Childress' first start of the sea
son came in the Cardinal's sixth con
ference game, a 67-52 thrashing of
UCLA. 15-0. Suddenly, Stanford
was one of just two undefeated
teams in the country. 16-0. 17-0.
Questions about the streak started
flowing in.
"On a team like this it's impossi
ble to have things not occur to you,
because all the sportswriters need
something to write about," Kir
chofer says. "We knew we had a
chance to do something really spe
cial, but there was never any
thought that we had done some
thing special. It was all a work in
progress."
Second-ranked Stanford rolled
into Eugene, Ore., on Jan. 31 with
out the services of Davis, who had
hurt his knee in win number 17, and
for the first time all year, the Cardi
nal wasn't able to pick up the slack.
A middling Oregon team jumped
out to a 45-26 lead. Nothing was
working; Childress was having an
off night, Robinson was l-of-8 from
the field and Little played just five
minutes due to foul trouble.
Stanford called timeout.
"Nobody was in there talking
about, 'Oh, what if we're not unde
feated tomorrow,"' Kirchofer re
members. "It was more just about
getting it done."
"I remember our assistant
coach, Russell Turner, just got in my
face and started ripping me a new
one," Hernandez says. "Obviously
I'm paraphrasing, but, 'When are
you going to play? You going to start
playing?"'
That's when the Cardinal's point
guard, its self-proclaimed distribu
tor, flipped the switch. Hernandez
became aggressive, driving time
and time again, making trip after
trip to the free-throw line. All 22 of
his points came after halftime, and
with the help of 19 points from
Davis' replacement, sophomore
Matt Haryasz, the Cardinal escaped
83-80.
Halfway through the conference
season, Stanford was still undefeat

MATT LOTTICH 'O4
Guard
Originally published, on Feb. 7,
201b.
Annie Robinson turns 10 next
month, but her dad will be on a busi
ness trip that night. The Southern
Utah men's basketball team will be
in Missoula, Mont., and Pops has a
game to coach.
If you follow Stanford basket
ball, you probably don't know much
about the Thunderbirds. Yet you
have heard of Annie, maybe by a dif
ferent name, the one that broad
casters Brent Musburger and Dick
Vitale proposed on national televi
sion 10 years ago today.
"Buzzer-beater."
Some call it "The Miracle at
Maples"; others, simply "The Shot."
But when Nick Robinson 'O4 M.A.
'O5 sunk a 35-foot runner as time ex
pired to give No. 2 Stanford an 80-77
win against No. 12 Arizona send
ing Musburger and Vitale into hys
terics, the Sixth Man Club onto the
Maples Pavilion hardwood and the
Cardinal to a 20-0 record there
were, in truth, no words to describe
what had just happened.
Ten years after Robinson's icon
ic shot, that has changed.
"As a huge Stanford fan in pretty
much any sport, this was one of the
greatest games I've ever been to,"
Tiger Woods told The Daily through
his agent last month. "To come back
like that, and with that type of shot,
is something I'll never forget."
"It's one of the best finishes I've
ever seen," added Heisman Trophy
winner and Super Bowl MVP Jim
Plunkett, who sat behind Woods at
the game. "It goes down with the
great Stanford historic moments."
The moment itself has lingered
in the memories of Cardinal fans for
a decade, and it has stuck with mem

bers of the 2003-04 hoops team as
well. Rob Little 'O5, then Stanford's
starting center, has a framed photo
in his house of Robinson shooting
the ball; Josh Childress 'O5, the
team's star forward and a seven
year NBA veteran, still gets chills

watching that clip.
But the story of Feb. 7, 2004, is
not just one of an improbable steal
and an impossible shot. It's one of a
fierce West Coast rivalry, hitting its
unforgettable zenith; of a basket
ball-frenzied campus, converging

on its beloved stomping grounds for
one final season; of a 24-year-old
utility player, at once the odd man
out and his team's most respected
member; and of a group of 14 con
ference champion teammates, the
likes of which haven't been seen on

the Farm since.

On Feb. 7, 2004, forward Nick Robinson (21) hit a 35-foot runner as time expired to propel No. 2 Stanford past No. 12 Arizona 80-77 in what is
perhaps the most exciting game in Stanford basketball history. Notable Stanford alumni, including Tiger Woods and Jim Plunkett, attended the game
and witnessed Robinson's heroic buzzer-beater. Robinson is currently the men's basketball head coach at Southern Utah University.
partures Jason and Jarron
Collins, Casey Jacobsen and Curtis
Borchardt in two years. That old
guard had set a new standard for
Cardinal men's basketball under
head coach Mike Montgomery,
starting the 2000-01 season 20-0,
holding the No. 1 spot for much of
that year and reaching the Elite
Eight.
Facing a significant experience
gap entering the 2002-03 season,
Stanford was picked to finish sev
enth in the Pac-10. But instead of
going their separate ways for the
summer, as most college players did
at the time, the entire Cardinal ros
ter stayed on campus to train. They
had seen an earlier generation of
teammates make Stanford an elite
college basketball program, and
they wanted to do the same. The
team finished second, and the next
summer, it followed the same rou
tine to prepare for the 2003-04 sea
son.

"We felt that we had the talent to
[return to the top]," says the team's
junior point guard, Chris Hernan
dez 'O5 M.A. 'O6. "We held each
other accountable, people calling
people up if they didn't show up for
a voluntary workout and whatnot."
"Everyone was the one guy try
ing to play the hardest in practice
every day," adds Joe Kirchofer 'O3,
one of the team's three captains. "It
wasn't just one of us; it was every
body trying to set that tone, which
made it really fun."
Most important was a lack of ego
from Stanford's top players, includ
ing from the most talented of them
all, Childress.
"Our best players wanted the
team to be successful more than
they wanted themselves to be suc
cessful," Kirchofer says. "I think
Josh Childress deserves a ton of
credit for the way that we all ap
proached the team and the way that
we were able to work together so ef
fectively."
Though Childress was just
months away from being selected
sixth overall in the NBA draft
higher than any other player in
Stanford history the talented
forward brought a calm focus to
Cardinal practices.
The vocal leadership was left to
Kirchofer and guard Matt Lottich
'O4, a deadly 3-point shooter and the
team's second-leading scorer. He
was the team's most competitive
player, and unlike Childress, he let it
show.
"The guy was in your face, talk
ing smack in your practice, kind of
getting people rough," Hernandez
remembers. "Sometimes you're
going through practices and you're
working hard, but your mind might
not be really there. You're thinking
about the 20-page paper you have to
write later that night or all the dif
ferent stuff that goes on at school.
And sometimes you get someone
who can sense that. They get in your
face, they get you focused, get you
mad so that you want to really com
pete and beat that person.
"But you can't have five people
who are like that," he adds, "because
you would never get anything done.
Everyone would just be yelling at
each other all the time."
The Childress-Lottich foil exem
plified the team's diverse personali
ties. There was the philosophical
Little, a 6-foot-10 center whose
opinions were as thoughtful as his
name was ironic; Justin Davis, a
comedic big man who could lighten
the mood in an instant; and Kir
chofer, a fifth-year leader whose
positive attitude and work ethic had
made him a primary backup over a
long career. Setting the tone on the
court was Hernandez, who returned
after breaking his foot twice and
missing the entire 2002-03 season,
instantly making the Cardinal bet
ter with his mistake-free play and
ability to read the game.
Nick Robinson wasn't an injury
hardened vet, a future NBA talent
or even a trash-talker, but in this
cast of characters, it was he who
stood out. Robinson had originally
signed with Stanford in 1997, but he
took two years off for a Mormon
mission in Brazil, where he kept in
practice by playing against his fel

low missionaries on an outdoor
court. When Robinson finally made
it to the Farm, he was as old as the
team's juniors.
"I had never met Nick, but I was
really excited because we were two
freshmen coming into the team,"
Lottich remembers. "And all of a
sudden, he's on campus saying
things like, 'Yeah, I got married last
week.' Our lives were very different,
very quickly."
Instead of living in the dorms,
Robinson and his wife Meagan
moved into the on-campus couples
housing in Escondido Village. By
the start of the 2003-04 season, Nick
was the oldest player on the team
even though he was just a junior
athletically.
"He could've been living on the
moon, his lifestyle was so different
than ours," Kirchofer says. "But his
wife was pregnant and we were
super-excited, like the whole team
was getting a little brother or some
thing.
"A little sister, as it were."
Annie was due on March 1,2004.
Robinson's teammates started call
ing him 'Pops.'
Despite his family responsibili
ties, Robinson was no outcast. His
perspective may have been differ
ent, but Lottich remembers that it
kept the team even-keeled, and
Childress says that Robinson's
opinions were always valued highly.
The team even saw Meagan's home
cooked meals as a chance to get
away from the college lifestyle.
"I've played a lot of basketball
since then and I've coached basket
ball, and I haven't really been a part
of a locker room that was that tight,"
Lottich says. "I haven't been part of
a group of guys that I trust more,
both on and off the court, than that
group ... There's no doubt in my
mind that if one of them calls me
right now and needs something, I'd
be on the next plane out. It was that
special."
On the court, Robinson was the
final, invaluable piece in the Cardi
nal puzzle. He was usually listed as a
forward, but he played all over the
floor, guarding different positions,
creating steals and contributing a
few buckets a game —in Robin
son's own words, doing whatever he
could to help.
And the Cardinal needed all the
help it could get early in the season,
with Childress out for over a month
with a stress reaction in his foot. But
Stanford rolled through nonconfer
ence play, knocking off then-No. 1
Kansas in a win that shocked every
one but the Cardinal. The team
amassed a 9-0 record and rose to
No. 5 in the country before Chil
dress' return for the Pac-10 opener.
"We felt like that with him and
with everybody at full strength, we
would be poised for a really special
season," Robinson says.
Slowly but surely, Childress
made his way back onto the court:
seven minutes against Washington
State, 13 against Washington, 26 at
Arizona State. 9-0 became 10-0, and
11-0 became 12-0.
Childress' first start of the sea
son came in the Cardinal's sixth con
ference game, a 67-52 thrashing of
UCLA. 15-0. Suddenly, Stanford
was one of just two undefeated
teams in the country. 16-0. 17-0.
Questions about the streak started
flowing in.
"On a team like this it's impossi
ble to have things not occur to you,

something to write about," Kir
chofer says. "We knew we had a

cial, but there was never any

out the services of Davis, who had
hurt his knee in win number 17, and
for the first time all year, the Cardi

bers of the 2003-04 hoops team as
well. Rob Little 'O5, then Stanford's
starting center, has a framed photo
in his house of Robinson shooting
the ball; Josh Childress 'O5, the
team's star forward and a seven
year NBA veteran, still gets chills

watching that clip.
But the story of Feb. 7, 2004, is
not just one of an improbable steal
and an impossible shot. It's one of a
fierce West Coast rivalry, hitting its
unforgettable zenith; of a basket
ball-frenzied campus, converging

on its beloved stomping grounds for
one final season; of a 24-year-old
utility player, at once the odd man
out and his team's most respected
member; and of a group of 14 con
ference champion teammates, the
likes of which haven't been seen on

the Farm since.

On Feb. 7, 2004, forward Nick Robinson (21) hit a 35-foot runner as time expired to propel No. 2 Stanford past No. 12 Arizona 80-77 in what is
perhaps the most exciting game in Stanford basketball history. Notable Stanford alumni, including Tiger Woods and Jim Plunkett, attended the game
and witnessed Robinson's heroic buzzer-beater. Robinson is currently the men's basketball head coach at Southern Utah University.
partures Jason and Jarron
Collins, Casey Jacobsen and Curtis
Borchardt in two years. That old
guard had set a new standard for
Cardinal men's basketball under
head coach Mike Montgomery,
starting the 2000-01 season 20-0,
holding the No. 1 spot for much of
that year and reaching the Elite
Eight.
Facing a significant experience
gap entering the 2002-03 season,
Stanford was picked to finish sev
enth in the Pac-10. But instead of
going their separate ways for the
summer, as most college players did
at the time, the entire Cardinal ros
ter stayed on campus to train. They
had seen an earlier generation of
teammates make Stanford an elite
college basketball program, and
they wanted to do the same. The
team finished second, and the next
summer, it followed the same rou
tine to prepare for the 2003-04 sea
son.

"We felt that we had the talent to
[return to the top]," says the team's
junior point guard, Chris Hernan
dez 'O5 M.A. 'O6. "We held each
other accountable, people calling
people up if they didn't show up for
a voluntary workout and whatnot."
"Everyone was the one guy try
ing to play the hardest in practice
every day," adds Joe Kirchofer 'O3,
one of the team's three captains. "It
wasn't just one of us; it was every
body trying to set that tone, which
made it really fun."
Most important was a lack of ego
from Stanford's top players, includ
ing from the most talented of them
all, Childress.
"Our best players wanted the
team to be successful more than
they wanted themselves to be suc
cessful," Kirchofer says. "I think
Josh Childress deserves a ton of
credit for the way that we all ap
proached the team and the way that
we were able to work together so ef
fectively."
Though Childress was just
months away from being selected
sixth overall in the NBA draft
higher than any other player in
Stanford history the talented
forward brought a calm focus to
Cardinal practices.
The vocal leadership was left to
Kirchofer and guard Matt Lottich
'O4, a deadly 3-point shooter and the
team's second-leading scorer. He
was the team's most competitive
player, and unlike Childress, he let it
show.
"The guy was in your face, talk
ing smack in your practice, kind of
getting people rough," Hernandez
remembers. "Sometimes you're
going through practices and you're
working hard, but your mind might
not be really there. You're thinking
about the 20-page paper you have to
write later that night or all the dif
ferent stuff that goes on at school.
And sometimes you get someone
who can sense that. They get in your
face, they get you focused, get you
mad so that you want to really com
pete and beat that person.
"But you can't have five people
who are like that," he adds, "because
you would never get anything done.
Everyone would just be yelling at
each other all the time."
The Childress-Lottich foil exem
plified the team's diverse personali
ties. There was the philosophical
Little, a 6-foot-10 center whose
opinions were as thoughtful as his
name was ironic; Justin Davis, a
comedic big man who could lighten
the mood in an instant; and Kir
chofer, a fifth-year leader whose
positive attitude and work ethic had
made him a primary backup over a
long career. Setting the tone on the
court was Hernandez, who returned
after breaking his foot twice and
missing the entire 2002-03 season,
instantly making the Cardinal bet
ter with his mistake-free play and
ability to read the game.
Nick Robinson wasn't an injury
hardened vet, a future NBA talent
or even a trash-talker, but in this
cast of characters, it was he who
stood out. Robinson had originally
signed with Stanford in 1997, but he
took two years off for a Mormon
mission in Brazil, where he kept in
practice by playing against his fel

low missionaries on an outdoor
court. When Robinson finally made
it to the Farm, he was as old as the
team's juniors.
"I had never met Nick, but I was
really excited because we were two
freshmen coming into the team,"
Lottich remembers. "And all of a
sudden, he's on campus saying
things like, 'Yeah, I got married last
week.' Our lives were very different,
very quickly."
Instead of living in the dorms,
Robinson and his wife Meagan
moved into the on-campus couples
housing in Escondido Village. By
the start of the 2003-04 season, Nick
was the oldest player on the team
even though he was just a junior
athletically.
"He could've been living on the
moon, his lifestyle was so different
than ours," Kirchofer says. "But his
wife was pregnant and we were
super-excited, like the whole team
was getting a little brother or some
thing.
"A little sister, as it were."
Annie was due on March 1,2004.
Robinson's teammates started call
ing him 'Pops.'
Despite his family responsibili
ties, Robinson was no outcast. His
perspective may have been differ
ent, but Lottich remembers that it
kept the team even-keeled, and
Childress says that Robinson's
opinions were always valued highly.
The team even saw Meagan's home
cooked meals as a chance to get
away from the college lifestyle.
"I've played a lot of basketball
since then and I've coached basket
ball, and I haven't really been a part
of a locker room that was that tight,"
Lottich says. "I haven't been part of
a group of guys that I trust more,
both on and off the court, than that
group ... There's no doubt in my
mind that if one of them calls me
right now and needs something, I'd
be on the next plane out. It was that
special."
On the court, Robinson was the
final, invaluable piece in the Cardi
nal puzzle. He was usually listed as a
forward, but he played all over the
floor, guarding different positions,
creating steals and contributing a
few buckets a game —in Robin
son's own words, doing whatever he
could to help.
And the Cardinal needed all the
help it could get early in the season,
with Childress out for over a month
with a stress reaction in his foot. But
Stanford rolled through nonconfer
ence play, knocking off then-No. 1
Kansas in a win that shocked every
one but the Cardinal. The team
amassed a 9-0 record and rose to
No. 5 in the country before Chil
dress' return for the Pac-10 opener.
"We felt like that with him and
with everybody at full strength, we
would be poised for a really special
season," Robinson says.
Slowly but surely, Childress
made his way back onto the court:
seven minutes against Washington
State, 13 against Washington, 26 at
Arizona State. 9-0 became 10-0, and
11-0 became 12-0.
Childress' first start of the sea
son came in the Cardinal's sixth con
ference game, a 67-52 thrashing of
UCLA. 15-0. Suddenly, Stanford
was one of just two undefeated
teams in the country. 16-0. 17-0.
Questions about the streak started
flowing in.
"On a team like this it's impossi
ble to have things not occur to you,
because all the sportswriters need
something to write about," Kir
chofer says. "We knew we had a
chance to do something really spe
cial, but there was never any
thought that we had done some
thing special. It was all a work in
progress."
Second-ranked Stanford rolled
into Eugene, Ore., on Jan. 31 with
out the services of Davis, who had
hurt his knee in win number 17, and
for the first time all year, the Cardi
nal wasn't able to pick up the slack.
A middling Oregon team jumped
out to a 45-26 lead. Nothing was
working; Childress was having an
off night, Robinson was l-of-8 from
the field and Little played just five
minutes due to foul trouble.
Stanford called timeout.
"Nobody was in there talking
about, 'Oh, what if we're not unde
feated tomorrow,"' Kirchofer re
members. "It was more just about
getting it done."
"I remember our assistant
coach, Russell Turner, just got in my
face and started ripping me a new
one," Hernandez says. "Obviously
I'm paraphrasing, but, 'When are
you going to play? You going to start
playing?"'
That's when the Cardinal's point
guard, its self-proclaimed distribu
tor, flipped the switch. Hernandez
became aggressive, driving time
and time again, making trip after
trip to the free-throw line. All 22 of
his points came after halftime, and
with the help of 19 points from
Davis' replacement, sophomore
Matt Haryasz, the Cardinal escaped
83-80.
Halfway through the conference
season, Stanford was still undefeat
ed. The phoenix had taken flight.
