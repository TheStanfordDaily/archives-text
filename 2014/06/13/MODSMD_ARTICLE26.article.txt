This is the first piece in a three
part feature this week on Lance
Anderson, Stanford football's
defensive coordinator and ace
recruiter, who is now entering
his eighth season with Stanford
football. Part I focuses on An
derson's reshaping of Stan
ford's recruiting apparatus.
Part II covers Anderson's lead
ership of the defense and part
111 covers Anderson's life as a
college coach.

Three coaches remain
from the staff that ini
tially accompanied Jim
Harbaugh to Stanford in
December 2006: David
Shaw, Shannon Turley and Lance
Anderson.
Shaw rose from offensive coordi
nator to head coach and won the next
two Pac-12 Coach of the Year
awards. Turley slashed Stanford's

injury rates and was voted the best
strength coach in the country last
November by the National Strength
and Conditioning Association. An
derson, Stanford's new defensive co
ordinator and ace recruiter, has
flown under the radar for a long
time, but his successes are funda
mental to the program, and even for
people only tangentially acquainted
to the program, the responsibilities
that have come with his new title
have made him impossible to ignore.
This is the story of Stanford's
rise of a university that learned
to sell itself like no other. It's the
story of a team and program that
has surpassed the legend of the peo
ple that brought it back to promi
nence. It's also the story of one of the
best recruiters in America.

College football is a deceptively
deterministic sport. For a game that
is so celebrated for its spectacular
upsets, its thrilling victories and, of
course, the coaches roaming the
sidelines, it's surprising if not out
right counterintuitive that so much
of the game is dependent upon re
cruiting, an aspect of the game that
few people ever get to see.

The numbers bear this out. A
comprehensive study of the 2012 col
lege football season by statistician
Dave Bartoo found that 76.5 percent
of college football games in the BCS
Automatic Qualifier conferences
could be predicted six months before
the season even began, just by ana
lyzing historical recruiting rankings
and correcting for home-field advan
tage. Moreover, recruiting is tradi
tionally been range-bound: teams
rarely make massive leaps in that
field.
"People don't want to admit this,
but most teams are as good as they'll
ever be right now," Bartoo said. And
the hard truth is that for a good part
of Stanford's history, its losses were
decided before the game even began.
While Bartoo was very compli
mentary of Stanford's current
coaches comparing recruiting
based expected win totals to per
formance on the field, the Cardinal's
entire program adds approximately
two wins a year to Stanford's record
it is clear, both from his perspec
tive and from the numbers, that im
proved recruiting is the biggest rea
