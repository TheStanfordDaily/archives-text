# FUELING THE MACHINE LANCEANDERSON AND THE REINVENTION OF THE CARDINAL FOOTBALL RECRUITING GAME
## 
### WINSTON SHI MANAGING EDITOR

This is the first piece in a three
part feature this week on Lance
Anderson, Stanford football's
defensive coordinator and ace
recruiter, who is now entering
his eighth season with Stanford
football. Part I focuses on An
derson's reshaping of Stan
ford's recruiting apparatus.
Part II covers Anderson's lead
ership of the defense and part
111 covers Anderson's life as a
college coach.

Three coaches remain
from the staff that ini
tially accompanied Jim
Harbaugh to Stanford in
December 2006: David
Shaw, Shannon Turley and Lance
Anderson.
Shaw rose from offensive coordi
nator to head coach and won the next
two Pac-12 Coach of the Year
awards. Turley slashed Stanford's

injury rates and was voted the best
strength coach in the country last
November by the National Strength
and Conditioning Association. An
derson, Stanford's new defensive co
ordinator and ace recruiter, has
flown under the radar for a long
time, but his successes are funda
mental to the program, and even for
people only tangentially acquainted
to the program, the responsibilities
that have come with his new title
have made him impossible to ignore.
This is the story of Stanford's
rise of a university that learned
to sell itself like no other. It's the
story of a team and program that
has surpassed the legend of the peo
ple that brought it back to promi
nence. It's also the story of one of the
best recruiters in America.

College football is a deceptively
deterministic sport. For a game that
is so celebrated for its spectacular
upsets, its thrilling victories and, of
course, the coaches roaming the
sidelines, it's surprising if not out
right counterintuitive that so much
of the game is dependent upon re
cruiting, an aspect of the game that
few people ever get to see.

The numbers bear this out. A
comprehensive study of the 2012 col
lege football season by statistician
Dave Bartoo found that 76.5 percent
of college football games in the BCS
Automatic Qualifier conferences
could be predicted six months before
the season even began, just by ana
lyzing historical recruiting rankings
and correcting for home-field advan
tage. Moreover, recruiting is tradi
tionally been range-bound: teams
rarely make massive leaps in that
field.
"People don't want to admit this,
but most teams are as good as they'll
ever be right now," Bartoo said. And
the hard truth is that for a good part
of Stanford's history, its losses were
decided before the game even began.
While Bartoo was very compli
mentary of Stanford's current
coaches comparing recruiting
based expected win totals to per
formance on the field, the Cardinal's
entire program adds approximately
two wins a year to Stanford's record
it is clear, both from his perspec
tive and from the numbers, that im

son why Stanford went from 1-11 to
12-1 in just four short years.
Recruiting rankings are not al
ways perfect; Dallas Cowboys de
fensive end Ben Gardner, a two-star
prospect, caught Stanford's eye not
with his star rating but from a rec
ommendation by Jim Harbaugh's
dad. But overall, the rankings are a
solid predictor of future success.
From 2003 to 2008, recruiting news
service Scout.com ranked Stan
ford's recruiting classes Nos. 26,46,
38,38,43 and 44. After the program
started showing sustained progress
during the fall of 2008, Stanford's
classes were ranked Nos. 16,24,23,
7,57 and 16.
Translating recruit-speak to
English, during the first period,
Stanford's recruiting was only good
for somewhere around eighth in a
10-team league. During the latter
period, Stanford has been the
fourth-best recruiter in the Pac-12,
despite its famous (or infamous) aca
demic requirements for recruits.
"They've had some big classes,
but it's sustaining itself —that's
what's amazing," Bartoo says. The
Cardinal have been top-two re
cruiters in the conference two out of
the last three years, and have actual
ly surpassed Oregon in recruiting
prowess. It's no surprise that in
2012, Scout named Anderson its na
tional recruiter of the year.

" The key guy is Lance Anderson
in all of this, above everybody in my
opinion," Harbaugh told The Daily
in an interview for the book Rags to
Roses last spring. "He is the one con
sistent thread for six years."
In person, it's clear that Ander
son can get a guy to go to Stanford
and, perhaps more importantly, get
the recruit's parents on board as
well. Lance Anderson has the rare
talent of making people like him al
most instantly. He is smart, he is
charismatic and he has a compelling
ability to put people at ease; in short,
he resembles the archetypal Ameri
can cool uncle.
Naturally he has all the tangible
successes you would expect from an
ace recruiter: In just one year, An
derson led the way in recruitments
of highly touted players like Andrus
Peat, Aziz Shittu, Noor Davis, Blake
Martinez, Zach Hoffpauir and Luke
Kaumatule — players that between
them had offers from nearly every
major program in the country.
But Anderson's greatest achieve
ments have been strategic rather
than tactical. Put simply, Anderson
has changed the very science of how
Stanford approaches recruiting.
Over the last seven years, Ander
son has focused the program on tar

geting players in a more nuanced
manner. Stanford's recruiting had
never been focused on a single coach
in the past Tavita Pritchard 'O9, a
quarterback at Stanford when An
derson arrived on campus, was re
cruited by Buddy Teevens, played
his first two seasons under Walt
Harris and became Stanford's start
ing quarterback under Harbaugh
and even though a flashy guy like
Harbaugh could play an important
role in recruiting, the emphasis
would always be on what Stanford it
self could offer, and how best to mar
ket that to students.
In addition to furiously selling
Stanford to recruits across the coun
try, Anderson worked hard to adver
tise the Stanford program, proac
tively contact potential recruits, help
them negotiate the Stanford admis
sions office and work with them to
write the best application possible.
The first part was marketing:
Early on, Stanford essentially car
pet-bombed prospective recruits
with non-committable offers (before
they had actually been approved by
the admissions office), just to get the
Cardinal into the conversation.
As Stanford improved on the
field, recruiting shifted toward a
more selective strategy. Stanford's
advertising emphasized the team's
success in tandem with the Universi
ty's academic reputation. A well
known letter to recruits cleverly
touted both the Cardinal program
and the earning potential of a Stan
ford degree, pointing out that Stan
ford outpaced the rest of the football
top 25 in graduates' expected future
salary.
Leveraging the University's
other built-in advantages was a key
prong of Stanford's success. Ander
son was confident that Stanford
could, in short, sell itself if recruits
visited the campus, especially dur
ing the beautiful California summer.
"I was just going through the
roster the last week," Anderson told
The Daily for Rags to Roses last
year, after Stanford inked another
star-studded recruiting class. "Al
most everybody on our roster is a
guy that visited... the summer their
junior year or sometime before."
As his colleague Mike Eubanks
put it for the same project, "If they
visit, they will come."
But the big issue, as it had always
been, was navigating the admissions
office. Since the days of Pop Warner,
Stanford coaches have worried
about admissions standards. Ander
son tried to understand the process
by putting himself in an admissions
officer's shoes.
"After being here just a short
time, we started to get kids denied
or we found about a couple kids who
had already been denied right be
fore we got here, and it was really in
teresting looking into that why
some of those kids were denied and
what the situation was," Anderson
said. "Really, going through that
first recruiting class, it really be
came evident to me that, boy, it's im
portant to get on kids early and
make sure they understand what all
the academic requirements are, in
terms of the classes we're looking
for them to take, the kind of test
scores we're looking for.
"There's not a magic number
[where] okay, they get to this, and
they're going to get in," Anderson
continued. "[The admissions office
is] also gonna put a lot of weight on
your application. How well did you
write the essays, how detailed and
thorough were you in filling every
thing else out, what did your teacher
recommendations say about you,
what did that counselor or score re
port, what did that say about you?"
What did that say about
you? Indeed, going beyond the
measurables SAT scores, 40-
yard dash, GPA, three-cone drill
was a view that both coaches and ad
missions officers could get behind.
Stanford football succeeded by
its working with the admissions of
fice. While academic requirements
did restrict Stanford's pool of poten
tial recruits, Anderson actually
credits the admissions process, as
well as the team's strength and con
ditioning regimen, with helping
Stanford's attrition rates. Every Di

vision I FBS team gets 85 scholar
ships a year; in a five-year stretch
from 2008 to 2012, Stanford only
signed 102 players. During that time
frame, Alabama signed 135. Addi
tionally, having to sign fewer re
cruits also depresses recruiting
rankings concealing how talent
ed Stanford's roster really is.
"[The admissions officers] want
to make sure that the kids who are
admitted here ... are able to be suc
cessful here. Not just get by, not just
survive, but that they are able to
succeed here," Anderson said re
cently. "You [might] think by relax
ing standards we can get better
players and stuff in, but in the long
term that's going to hurt you, be
cause those guys are going to have a
hard time graduating."
Indeed, recruiting standards
that were not commensurate with a
school's high academic standards
led to Cal football graduating a mis
erable 47 percent of players within
six years. Stanford escaped that
fate.
"Lance realized we're not gonna
change admissions here. He knew
we need to change what we do, and
that the key is to work with admis
sions," David Shaw told CBS.
"Lance was the first one to realize
and put that road map together."
♦ ♦♦
In recent years, when you think
of Stanford football, you think of Jim
Harbaugh, who raged on the side
lines and subjected the team to end
less viewings of The Ghost and the
Darkness-, you think of David
Shaw, whose presence permeates
everything from the halls of TEDx
to the Stanford Stadium video
board; you think of a series of wise
cracking, hard-hitting, trash-talk
ing playmakers at almost every po
sition on the field.
The achievement of the modern
Stanford football program is not re
ally its recruiting classes or its su
perstars or even its trophies. It is a
kind of culture change but not
just the idea that Stanford players
needed to be tougher or leaner or
meaner. Stanford has recruited to
the point that, while individuals will
always be important to the program,
they do not necessarily define it.
The history of Cardinal football
has been that of a never-ending se
ries of personalities. You have your
Ernie Neverses, your Jim Plunketts
and your John Elways. You have
your Toby Gerharts and your An
drew Lucks. Force of personality
goes a long way toward establishing
a legend: At Stanford's lowest
points, it must have seemed that
only some Hegelian man-god could
have rallied the Cardinal to a bowl
game. Top-end talent has always
been here, not that it necessarily
propelled the Cardinal to greatness;
as sportswriter Ivan Maisel 'Bl
pointedly commented on Twitter,
the 1980 Stanford team had three
College Football Hall of Earners and
went 6-5.
The extraordinary part of Stan
ford's rise is that finally, Stanford's
silverware seems to be outpacing
the faces that generated it. You
know the story by now: four straight
BCS bowls, two conference champi
onships and a Rose Bowl victory to
cap off the 2012 season.
The season is long, and in 2013,
Stanford survived a series of devas
tating injuries along the defensive
line that would have destroyed its
season in years past. Arriving on
campus in 2006, Anderson realized
that even after a 1-11 season, "we
had some good, talented kids on the
roster." But now, there is not only
star power on the Farm, but depth
as well.
If Lance Anderson never coach
es another day in his life, he can rest
assured of the fact that he was an in
tegral part of that ascent.

fensive end Ben Gardner, a two-star
prospect, caught Stanford's eye not
with his star rating but from a rec
ommendation by Jim Harbaugh's
dad. But overall, the rankings are a
solid predictor of future success.
From 2003 to 2008, recruiting news
service Scout.com ranked Stan
ford's recruiting classes Nos. 26,46,
38,38,43 and 44. After the program
started showing sustained progress
during the fall of 2008, Stanford's
classes were ranked Nos. 16,24,23,
7,57 and 16.
Translating recruit-speak to
English, during the first period,
Stanford's recruiting was only good
for somewhere around eighth in a
10-team league. During the latter
period, Stanford has been the
fourth-best recruiter in the Pac-12,
despite its famous (or infamous) aca
demic requirements for recruits.
"They've had some big classes,
but it's sustaining itself —that's
what's amazing," Bartoo says. The
Cardinal have been top-two re
cruiters in the conference two out of
the last three years, and have actual
ly surpassed Oregon in recruiting
prowess. It's no surprise that in
2012, Scout named Anderson its na
tional recruiter of the year.

" The key guy is Lance Anderson
in all of this, above everybody in my
opinion," Harbaugh told The Daily
in an interview for the book Rags to
Roses last spring. "He is the one con
sistent thread for six years."
In person, it's clear that Ander
son can get a guy to go to Stanford
and, perhaps more importantly, get
the recruit's parents on board as
well. Lance Anderson has the rare
talent of making people like him al
most instantly. He is smart, he is
charismatic and he has a compelling
ability to put people at ease; in short,
he resembles the archetypal Ameri
can cool uncle.
Naturally he has all the tangible
successes you would expect from an
ace recruiter: In just one year, An
derson led the way in recruitments
of highly touted players like Andrus
Peat, Aziz Shittu, Noor Davis, Blake
Martinez, Zach Hoffpauir and Luke
Kaumatule — players that between
them had offers from nearly every
major program in the country.
But Anderson's greatest achieve
ments have been strategic rather
than tactical. Put simply, Anderson
has changed the very science of how
Stanford approaches recruiting.
Over the last seven years, Ander
son has focused the program on tar

geting players in a more nuanced
manner. Stanford's recruiting had
never been focused on a single coach
in the past Tavita Pritchard 'O9, a
quarterback at Stanford when An
derson arrived on campus, was re
cruited by Buddy Teevens, played
his first two seasons under Walt
Harris and became Stanford's start
ing quarterback under Harbaugh
and even though a flashy guy like
Harbaugh could play an important
role in recruiting, the emphasis
would always be on what Stanford it
self could offer, and how best to mar
ket that to students.
In addition to furiously selling
Stanford to recruits across the coun
try, Anderson worked hard to adver
tise the Stanford program, proac
tively contact potential recruits, help
them negotiate the Stanford admis
sions office and work with them to
write the best application possible.
The first part was marketing:
Early on, Stanford essentially car
pet-bombed prospective recruits
with non-committable offers (before
they had actually been approved by
the admissions office), just to get the
Cardinal into the conversation.
As Stanford improved on the
field, recruiting shifted toward a
more selective strategy. Stanford's
advertising emphasized the team's
success in tandem with the Universi
ty's academic reputation. A well
known letter to recruits cleverly
touted both the Cardinal program
and the earning potential of a Stan
ford degree, pointing out that Stan
ford outpaced the rest of the football
top 25 in graduates' expected future
salary.
Leveraging the University's
other built-in advantages was a key
prong of Stanford's success. Ander
son was confident that Stanford
could, in short, sell itself if recruits
visited the campus, especially dur
ing the beautiful California summer.
"I was just going through the
roster the last week," Anderson told
The Daily for Rags to Roses last
year, after Stanford inked another
star-studded recruiting class. "Al
most everybody on our roster is a
guy that visited... the summer their
junior year or sometime before."
As his colleague Mike Eubanks
put it for the same project, "If they
visit, they will come."
But the big issue, as it had always
been, was navigating the admissions
office. Since the days of Pop Warner,
Stanford coaches have worried
about admissions standards. Ander
son tried to understand the process
by putting himself in an admissions
officer's shoes.
"After being here just a short
time, we started to get kids denied
or we found about a couple kids who
had already been denied right be
fore we got here, and it was really in
teresting looking into that why
some of those kids were denied and
what the situation was," Anderson
said. "Really, going through that
first recruiting class, it really be
came evident to me that, boy, it's im
portant to get on kids early and
make sure they understand what all
the academic requirements are, in
terms of the classes we're looking
for them to take, the kind of test
scores we're looking for.
"There's not a magic number
[where] okay, they get to this, and
they're going to get in," Anderson
continued. "[The admissions office
is] also gonna put a lot of weight on
your application. How well did you
write the essays, how detailed and
thorough were you in filling every
thing else out, what did your teacher
recommendations say about you,
what did that counselor or score re
port, what did that say about you?"
What did that say about
you? Indeed, going beyond the
measurables SAT scores, 40-
yard dash, GPA, three-cone drill
was a view that both coaches and ad
missions officers could get behind.
Stanford football succeeded by
its working with the admissions of
fice. While academic requirements
did restrict Stanford's pool of poten
tial recruits, Anderson actually
credits the admissions process, as
well as the team's strength and con
ditioning regimen, with helping
Stanford's attrition rates. Every Di

vision I FBS team gets 85 scholar
ships a year; in a five-year stretch
from 2008 to 2012, Stanford only
signed 102 players. During that time
frame, Alabama signed 135. Addi
tionally, having to sign fewer re
cruits also depresses recruiting
rankings concealing how talent
ed Stanford's roster really is.
"[The admissions officers] want
to make sure that the kids who are
admitted here ... are able to be suc
cessful here. Not just get by, not just
survive, but that they are able to
succeed here," Anderson said re
cently. "You [might] think by relax
ing standards we can get better
players and stuff in, but in the long
term that's going to hurt you, be
cause those guys are going to have a
hard time graduating."
Indeed, recruiting standards
that were not commensurate with a
school's high academic standards
led to Cal football graduating a mis
erable 47 percent of players within
six years. Stanford escaped that
fate.
"Lance realized we're not gonna
change admissions here. He knew
we need to change what we do, and
that the key is to work with admis
sions," David Shaw told CBS.
"Lance was the first one to realize
and put that road map together."
♦ ♦♦
In recent years, when you think
of Stanford football, you think of Jim
Harbaugh, who raged on the side
lines and subjected the team to end
less viewings of The Ghost and the
Darkness-, you think of David
Shaw, whose presence permeates
everything from the halls of TEDx
to the Stanford Stadium video
board; you think of a series of wise
cracking, hard-hitting, trash-talk
ing playmakers at almost every po
sition on the field.
The achievement of the modern
Stanford football program is not re
ally its recruiting classes or its su
perstars or even its trophies. It is a
kind of culture change but not
just the idea that Stanford players
needed to be tougher or leaner or
meaner. Stanford has recruited to
the point that, while individuals will
always be important to the program,
they do not necessarily define it.
The history of Cardinal football
has been that of a never-ending se
ries of personalities. You have your
Ernie Neverses, your Jim Plunketts
and your John Elways. You have
your Toby Gerharts and your An
drew Lucks. Force of personality
goes a long way toward establishing
a legend: At Stanford's lowest
points, it must have seemed that
only some Hegelian man-god could
have rallied the Cardinal to a bowl
game. Top-end talent has always
been here, not that it necessarily
propelled the Cardinal to greatness;
as sportswriter Ivan Maisel 'Bl
pointedly commented on Twitter,
the 1980 Stanford team had three
College Football Hall of Earners and
went 6-5.
The extraordinary part of Stan
ford's rise is that finally, Stanford's
silverware seems to be outpacing
the faces that generated it. You
know the story by now: four straight
BCS bowls, two conference champi
onships and a Rose Bowl victory to
cap off the 2012 season.
The season is long, and in 2013,
Stanford survived a series of devas
tating injuries along the defensive
line that would have destroyed its
season in years past. Arriving on
campus in 2006, Anderson realized
that even after a 1-11 season, "we
had some good, talented kids on the
roster." But now, there is not only
star power on the Farm, but depth
as well.
If Lance Anderson never coach
es another day in his life, he can rest
assured of the fact that he was an in
tegral part of that ascent.

This is the first piece in a three
part feature this week on Lance
Anderson, Stanford football's
defensive coordinator and ace
recruiter, who is now entering
his eighth season with Stanford
football. Part I focuses on An
derson's reshaping of Stan
ford's recruiting apparatus.
Part II covers Anderson's lead
ership of the defense and part
111 covers Anderson's life as a
college coach.

Three coaches remain
from the staff that ini
tially accompanied Jim
Harbaugh to Stanford in
December 2006: David
Shaw, Shannon Turley and Lance
Anderson.
Shaw rose from offensive coordi
nator to head coach and won the next
two Pac-12 Coach of the Year
awards. Turley slashed Stanford's

injury rates and was voted the best
strength coach in the country last
November by the National Strength
and Conditioning Association. An
derson, Stanford's new defensive co
ordinator and ace recruiter, has
flown under the radar for a long
time, but his successes are funda
mental to the program, and even for
people only tangentially acquainted
to the program, the responsibilities
that have come with his new title
have made him impossible to ignore.
This is the story of Stanford's
rise of a university that learned
to sell itself like no other. It's the
story of a team and program that
has surpassed the legend of the peo
ple that brought it back to promi
nence. It's also the story of one of the
best recruiters in America.

College football is a deceptively
deterministic sport. For a game that
is so celebrated for its spectacular
upsets, its thrilling victories and, of
course, the coaches roaming the
sidelines, it's surprising if not out
right counterintuitive that so much
of the game is dependent upon re
cruiting, an aspect of the game that
few people ever get to see.

The numbers bear this out. A
comprehensive study of the 2012 col
lege football season by statistician
Dave Bartoo found that 76.5 percent
of college football games in the BCS
Automatic Qualifier conferences
could be predicted six months before
the season even began, just by ana
lyzing historical recruiting rankings
and correcting for home-field advan
tage. Moreover, recruiting is tradi
tionally been range-bound: teams
rarely make massive leaps in that
field.
"People don't want to admit this,
but most teams are as good as they'll
ever be right now," Bartoo said. And
the hard truth is that for a good part
of Stanford's history, its losses were
decided before the game even began.
While Bartoo was very compli
mentary of Stanford's current
coaches comparing recruiting
based expected win totals to per
formance on the field, the Cardinal's
entire program adds approximately
two wins a year to Stanford's record
it is clear, both from his perspec

Early on, Stanford essentially car
pet-bombed prospective recruits
with non-committable offers (before
they had actually been approved by
the admissions office), just to get the
Cardinal into the conversation.
As Stanford improved on the
field, recruiting shifted toward a
more selective strategy. Stanford's
advertising emphasized the team's
success in tandem with the Universi
ty's academic reputation. A well
known letter to recruits cleverly
touted both the Cardinal program
and the earning potential of a Stan
ford degree, pointing out that Stan
ford outpaced the rest of the football
top 25 in graduates' expected future
salary.
Leveraging the University's
other built-in advantages was a key
prong of Stanford's success. Ander
son was confident that Stanford
could, in short, sell itself if recruits
visited the campus, especially dur
ing the beautiful California summer.
"I was just going through the
roster the last week," Anderson told
The Daily for Rags to Roses last
year, after Stanford inked another
star-studded recruiting class. "Al
most everybody on our roster is a
guy that visited... the summer their
junior year or sometime before."
As his colleague Mike Eubanks
put it for the same project, "If they
visit, they will come."
But the big issue, as it had always
been, was navigating the admissions
office. Since the days of Pop Warner,
Stanford coaches have worried
about admissions standards. Ander
son tried to understand the process
by putting himself in an admissions
officer's shoes.
"After being here just a short
time, we started to get kids denied
or we found about a couple kids who
had already been denied right be
fore we got here, and it was really in
teresting looking into that why
some of those kids were denied and
what the situation was," Anderson
said. "Really, going through that
first recruiting class, it really be
came evident to me that, boy, it's im
portant to get on kids early and
make sure they understand what all
the academic requirements are, in
terms of the classes we're looking
for them to take, the kind of test
scores we're looking for.
"There's not a magic number
[where] okay, they get to this, and
they're going to get in," Anderson
continued. "[The admissions office
is] also gonna put a lot of weight on
your application. How well did you
write the essays, how detailed and
thorough were you in filling every
thing else out, what did your teacher
recommendations say about you,
what did that counselor or score re
port, what did that say about you?"
What did that say about
you? Indeed, going beyond the
measurables SAT scores, 40-
yard dash, GPA, three-cone drill
was a view that both coaches and ad
missions officers could get behind.
Stanford football succeeded by
its working with the admissions of
fice. While academic requirements
did restrict Stanford's pool of poten
tial recruits, Anderson actually
credits the admissions process, as
well as the team's strength and con
ditioning regimen, with helping
Stanford's attrition rates. Every Di

vision I FBS team gets 85 scholar
ships a year; in a five-year stretch
from 2008 to 2012, Stanford only
signed 102 players. During that time
frame, Alabama signed 135. Addi
tionally, having to sign fewer re
cruits also depresses recruiting
rankings concealing how talent
ed Stanford's roster really is.
"[The admissions officers] want
to make sure that the kids who are
admitted here ... are able to be suc
cessful here. Not just get by, not just
survive, but that they are able to
succeed here," Anderson said re
cently. "You [might] think by relax
ing standards we can get better
players and stuff in, but in the long
term that's going to hurt you, be
cause those guys are going to have a
hard time graduating."
Indeed, recruiting standards
that were not commensurate with a
school's high academic standards
led to Cal football graduating a mis
erable 47 percent of players within
six years. Stanford escaped that
fate.
"Lance realized we're not gonna
change admissions here. He knew
we need to change what we do, and
that the key is to work with admis
sions," David Shaw told CBS.
"Lance was the first one to realize
and put that road map together."
♦ ♦♦
In recent years, when you think
of Stanford football, you think of Jim
Harbaugh, who raged on the side
lines and subjected the team to end
less viewings of The Ghost and the
Darkness-, you think of David
Shaw, whose presence permeates
everything from the halls of TEDx
to the Stanford Stadium video
board; you think of a series of wise
cracking, hard-hitting, trash-talk
ing playmakers at almost every po
sition on the field.
The achievement of the modern
Stanford football program is not re
ally its recruiting classes or its su
perstars or even its trophies. It is a
kind of culture change but not
just the idea that Stanford players
needed to be tougher or leaner or
meaner. Stanford has recruited to
the point that, while individuals will
always be important to the program,
they do not necessarily define it.
The history of Cardinal football
has been that of a never-ending se
ries of personalities. You have your
Ernie Neverses, your Jim Plunketts
and your John Elways. You have
your Toby Gerharts and your An
drew Lucks. Force of personality
goes a long way toward establishing
a legend: At Stanford's lowest
points, it must have seemed that
only some Hegelian man-god could
have rallied the Cardinal to a bowl
game. Top-end talent has always
been here, not that it necessarily
propelled the Cardinal to greatness;
as sportswriter Ivan Maisel 'Bl
pointedly commented on Twitter,
the 1980 Stanford team had three
College Football Hall of Earners and
went 6-5.
The extraordinary part of Stan
ford's rise is that finally, Stanford's
silverware seems to be outpacing
the faces that generated it. You
know the story by now: four straight
BCS bowls, two conference champi
onships and a Rose Bowl victory to
cap off the 2012 season.
The season is long, and in 2013,
Stanford survived a series of devas
tating injuries along the defensive
line that would have destroyed its
season in years past. Arriving on
campus in 2006, Anderson realized
that even after a 1-11 season, "we
had some good, talented kids on the
roster." But now, there is not only
star power on the Farm, but depth
as well.
If Lance Anderson never coach
es another day in his life, he can rest
assured of the fact that he was an in
tegral part of that ascent.

This is the first piece in a three
part feature this week on Lance
Anderson, Stanford football's
defensive coordinator and ace
recruiter, who is now entering
his eighth season with Stanford
football. Part I focuses on An
derson's reshaping of Stan
ford's recruiting apparatus.
Part II covers Anderson's lead
ership of the defense and part
111 covers Anderson's life as a
college coach.

Three coaches remain
from the staff that ini
tially accompanied Jim
Harbaugh to Stanford in
December 2006: David
Shaw, Shannon Turley and Lance
Anderson.
Shaw rose from offensive coordi
nator to head coach and won the next
two Pac-12 Coach of the Year
awards. Turley slashed Stanford's

injury rates and was voted the best
strength coach in the country last
November by the National Strength
and Conditioning Association. An
derson, Stanford's new defensive co
ordinator and ace recruiter, has
flown under the radar for a long
time, but his successes are funda
mental to the program, and even for
people only tangentially acquainted
to the program, the responsibilities
that have come with his new title
have made him impossible to ignore.
This is the story of Stanford's
rise of a university that learned
to sell itself like no other. It's the
story of a team and program that
has surpassed the legend of the peo
ple that brought it back to promi
nence. It's also the story of one of the
best recruiters in America.

College football is a deceptively
deterministic sport. For a game that
is so celebrated for its spectacular
upsets, its thrilling victories and, of
course, the coaches roaming the
sidelines, it's surprising if not out
right counterintuitive that so much
of the game is dependent upon re
cruiting, an aspect of the game that
few people ever get to see.

The numbers bear this out. A
comprehensive study of the 2012 col
lege football season by statistician
Dave Bartoo found that 76.5 percent
of college football games in the BCS
Automatic Qualifier conferences
could be predicted six months before
the season even began, just by ana
lyzing historical recruiting rankings
and correcting for home-field advan
tage. Moreover, recruiting is tradi
tionally been range-bound: teams
rarely make massive leaps in that
field.
"People don't want to admit this,
but most teams are as good as they'll
ever be right now," Bartoo said. And
the hard truth is that for a good part
of Stanford's history, its losses were
decided before the game even began.
While Bartoo was very compli
mentary of Stanford's current
coaches comparing recruiting
based expected win totals to per
formance on the field, the Cardinal's
entire program adds approximately
two wins a year to Stanford's record
it is clear, both from his perspec
tive and from the numbers, that im
proved recruiting is the biggest rea

son why Stanford went from 1-11 to
12-1 in just four short years.
Recruiting rankings are not al
ways perfect; Dallas Cowboys de
fensive end Ben Gardner, a two-star
prospect, caught Stanford's eye not
with his star rating but from a rec
ommendation by Jim Harbaugh's
dad. But overall, the rankings are a
solid predictor of future success.
From 2003 to 2008, recruiting news
service Scout.com ranked Stan
ford's recruiting classes Nos. 26,46,
38,38,43 and 44. After the program
started showing sustained progress
during the fall of 2008, Stanford's
classes were ranked Nos. 16,24,23,
7,57 and 16.
Translating recruit-speak to
English, during the first period,
Stanford's recruiting was only good
for somewhere around eighth in a
10-team league. During the latter
period, Stanford has been the
fourth-best recruiter in the Pac-12,
despite its famous (or infamous) aca
demic requirements for recruits.
"They've had some big classes,
but it's sustaining itself —that's
what's amazing," Bartoo says. The
Cardinal have been top-two re
cruiters in the conference two out of
the last three years, and have actual
ly surpassed Oregon in recruiting
prowess. It's no surprise that in
2012, Scout named Anderson its na
tional recruiter of the year.

" The key guy is Lance Anderson
in all of this, above everybody in my
opinion," Harbaugh told The Daily
in an interview for the book Rags to
Roses last spring. "He is the one con
sistent thread for six years."
In person, it's clear that Ander
son can get a guy to go to Stanford
and, perhaps more importantly, get
the recruit's parents on board as
well. Lance Anderson has the rare
talent of making people like him al
most instantly. He is smart, he is
charismatic and he has a compelling
ability to put people at ease; in short,
he resembles the archetypal Ameri
can cool uncle.
Naturally he has all the tangible
successes you would expect from an
ace recruiter: In just one year, An
derson led the way in recruitments
of highly touted players like Andrus
Peat, Aziz Shittu, Noor Davis, Blake
Martinez, Zach Hoffpauir and Luke
Kaumatule — players that between
them had offers from nearly every
major program in the country.
But Anderson's greatest achieve
ments have been strategic rather
than tactical. Put simply, Anderson
has changed the very science of how
Stanford approaches recruiting.
Over the last seven years, Ander
son has focused the program on tar

geting players in a more nuanced
manner. Stanford's recruiting had
never been focused on a single coach
in the past Tavita Pritchard 'O9, a
quarterback at Stanford when An
derson arrived on campus, was re
cruited by Buddy Teevens, played
his first two seasons under Walt
Harris and became Stanford's start
ing quarterback under Harbaugh
and even though a flashy guy like
Harbaugh could play an important
role in recruiting, the emphasis
would always be on what Stanford it
self could offer, and how best to mar
ket that to students.
In addition to furiously selling
Stanford to recruits across the coun
try, Anderson worked hard to adver
tise the Stanford program, proac
tively contact potential recruits, help
them negotiate the Stanford admis
sions office and work with them to
write the best application possible.
The first part was marketing:
Early on, Stanford essentially car
pet-bombed prospective recruits
with non-committable offers (before
they had actually been approved by

"[The admissions officers] want
to make sure that the kids who are
admitted here ... are able to be suc
cessful here. Not just get by, not just
survive, but that they are able to
succeed here," Anderson said re
cently. "You [might] think by relax
ing standards we can get better
players and stuff in, but in the long
term that's going to hurt you, be
cause those guys are going to have a
hard time graduating."
Indeed, recruiting standards
that were not commensurate with a
school's high academic standards
led to Cal football graduating a mis
erable 47 percent of players within
six years. Stanford escaped that
fate.
"Lance realized we're not gonna
change admissions here. He knew
we need to change what we do, and
that the key is to work with admis

"Lance was the first one to realize
and put that road map together."

In recent years, when you think
of Stanford football, you think of Jim
Harbaugh, who raged on the side
lines and subjected the team to end
less viewings of The Ghost and the
Darkness-, you think of David
Shaw, whose presence permeates
everything from the halls of TEDx
to the Stanford Stadium video
board; you think of a series of wise
cracking, hard-hitting, trash-talk
ing playmakers at almost every po
sition on the field.
The achievement of the modern
Stanford football program is not re
ally its recruiting classes or its su
perstars or even its trophies. It is a
kind of culture change but not
just the idea that Stanford players
needed to be tougher or leaner or
meaner. Stanford has recruited to
the point that, while individuals will
always be important to the program,
they do not necessarily define it.
The history of Cardinal football
has been that of a never-ending se
ries of personalities. You have your
Ernie Neverses, your Jim Plunketts
and your John Elways. You have
your Toby Gerharts and your An
drew Lucks. Force of personality
goes a long way toward establishing
a legend: At Stanford's lowest
points, it must have seemed that
only some Hegelian man-god could
have rallied the Cardinal to a bowl
game. Top-end talent has always
been here, not that it necessarily
propelled the Cardinal to greatness;
as sportswriter Ivan Maisel 'Bl
pointedly commented on Twitter,
the 1980 Stanford team had three
College Football Hall of Earners and
went 6-5.
The extraordinary part of Stan
ford's rise is that finally, Stanford's
silverware seems to be outpacing
the faces that generated it. You
know the story by now: four straight
BCS bowls, two conference champi
onships and a Rose Bowl victory to
cap off the 2012 season.
The season is long, and in 2013,
Stanford survived a series of devas
tating injuries along the defensive
line that would have destroyed its
season in years past. Arriving on
campus in 2006, Anderson realized
that even after a 1-11 season, "we
had some good, talented kids on the
roster." But now, there is not only
star power on the Farm, but depth
as well.
If Lance Anderson never coach
es another day in his life, he can rest
assured of the fact that he was an in
tegral part of that ascent.

This is the first piece in a three
part feature this week on Lance
Anderson, Stanford football's
defensive coordinator and ace
recruiter, who is now entering
his eighth season with Stanford
football. Part I focuses on An
derson's reshaping of Stan
ford's recruiting apparatus.
Part II covers Anderson's lead
ership of the defense and part
111 covers Anderson's life as a
college coach.

Three coaches remain
from the staff that ini
tially accompanied Jim
Harbaugh to Stanford in
December 2006: David
Shaw, Shannon Turley and Lance
Anderson.
Shaw rose from offensive coordi
nator to head coach and won the next
two Pac-12 Coach of the Year
awards. Turley slashed Stanford's

injury rates and was voted the best
strength coach in the country last
November by the National Strength
and Conditioning Association. An
derson, Stanford's new defensive co
ordinator and ace recruiter, has
flown under the radar for a long
time, but his successes are funda
mental to the program, and even for
people only tangentially acquainted
to the program, the responsibilities
that have come with his new title
have made him impossible to ignore.
This is the story of Stanford's
rise of a university that learned
to sell itself like no other. It's the
story of a team and program that
has surpassed the legend of the peo
ple that brought it back to promi
nence. It's also the story of one of the
best recruiters in America.

College football is a deceptively
deterministic sport. For a game that
is so celebrated for its spectacular
upsets, its thrilling victories and, of
course, the coaches roaming the
sidelines, it's surprising if not out
right counterintuitive that so much
of the game is dependent upon re
cruiting, an aspect of the game that
few people ever get to see.

The numbers bear this out. A
comprehensive study of the 2012 col
lege football season by statistician
Dave Bartoo found that 76.5 percent
of college football games in the BCS
Automatic Qualifier conferences
could be predicted six months before
the season even began, just by ana
lyzing historical recruiting rankings
and correcting for home-field advan
tage. Moreover, recruiting is tradi
tionally been range-bound: teams
rarely make massive leaps in that
field.
"People don't want to admit this,
but most teams are as good as they'll
ever be right now," Bartoo said. And
the hard truth is that for a good part
of Stanford's history, its losses were
decided before the game even began.
While Bartoo was very compli
mentary of Stanford's current
coaches comparing recruiting
based expected win totals to per
formance on the field, the Cardinal's
entire program adds approximately
two wins a year to Stanford's record
it is clear, both from his perspec
tive and from the numbers, that im
proved recruiting is the biggest rea

son why Stanford went from 1-11 to
12-1 in just four short years.
Recruiting rankings are not al
ways perfect; Dallas Cowboys de
fensive end Ben Gardner, a two-star
prospect, caught Stanford's eye not
with his star rating but from a rec
ommendation by Jim Harbaugh's
dad. But overall, the rankings are a
solid predictor of future success.
From 2003 to 2008, recruiting news
service Scout.com ranked Stan
ford's recruiting classes Nos. 26,46,
38,38,43 and 44. After the program
started showing sustained progress
during the fall of 2008, Stanford's
classes were ranked Nos. 16,24,23,
7,57 and 16.
Translating recruit-speak to
English, during the first period,
Stanford's recruiting was only good
for somewhere around eighth in a
10-team league. During the latter
period, Stanford has been the
fourth-best recruiter in the Pac-12,
despite its famous (or infamous) aca
demic requirements for recruits.
"They've had some big classes,
but it's sustaining itself —that's
what's amazing," Bartoo says. The
Cardinal have been top-two re
cruiters in the conference two out of
the last three years, and have actual
ly surpassed Oregon in recruiting
prowess. It's no surprise that in
2012, Scout named Anderson its na
tional recruiter of the year.

" The key guy is Lance Anderson
in all of this, above everybody in my
opinion," Harbaugh told The Daily
in an interview for the book Rags to
Roses last spring. "He is the one con
sistent thread for six years."
In person, it's clear that Ander
son can get a guy to go to Stanford
and, perhaps more importantly, get
the recruit's parents on board as
well. Lance Anderson has the rare
talent of making people like him al
most instantly. He is smart, he is
charismatic and he has a compelling
ability to put people at ease; in short,
he resembles the archetypal Ameri
can cool uncle.
Naturally he has all the tangible
successes you would expect from an
ace recruiter: In just one year, An
derson led the way in recruitments
of highly touted players like Andrus
Peat, Aziz Shittu, Noor Davis, Blake
Martinez, Zach Hoffpauir and Luke
Kaumatule — players that between
them had offers from nearly every
major program in the country.
But Anderson's greatest achieve
ments have been strategic rather
than tactical. Put simply, Anderson
has changed the very science of how
Stanford approaches recruiting.
Over the last seven years, Ander
son has focused the program on tar

geting players in a more nuanced
manner. Stanford's recruiting had
never been focused on a single coach
in the past Tavita Pritchard 'O9, a
quarterback at Stanford when An
derson arrived on campus, was re
cruited by Buddy Teevens, played
his first two seasons under Walt
Harris and became Stanford's start
ing quarterback under Harbaugh
and even though a flashy guy like
Harbaugh could play an important
role in recruiting, the emphasis
would always be on what Stanford it
self could offer, and how best to mar
ket that to students.
In addition to furiously selling
Stanford to recruits across the coun
try, Anderson worked hard to adver
tise the Stanford program, proac
tively contact potential recruits, help
them negotiate the Stanford admis
sions office and work with them to
write the best application possible.
The first part was marketing:
Early on, Stanford essentially car
pet-bombed prospective recruits
with non-committable offers (before
they had actually been approved by
the admissions office), just to get the
Cardinal into the conversation.
As Stanford improved on the
field, recruiting shifted toward a
more selective strategy. Stanford's
advertising emphasized the team's
success in tandem with the Universi
ty's academic reputation. A well
known letter to recruits cleverly
touted both the Cardinal program
and the earning potential of a Stan
ford degree, pointing out that Stan
ford outpaced the rest of the football
top 25 in graduates' expected future
salary.
Leveraging the University's
other built-in advantages was a key
prong of Stanford's success. Ander
son was confident that Stanford
could, in short, sell itself if recruits
visited the campus, especially dur
ing the beautiful California summer.
"I was just going through the
roster the last week," Anderson told
The Daily for Rags to Roses last
year, after Stanford inked another
star-studded recruiting class. "Al
most everybody on our roster is a
guy that visited... the summer their
junior year or sometime before."
As his colleague Mike Eubanks
put it for the same project, "If they
visit, they will come."
But the big issue, as it had always
been, was navigating the admissions
office. Since the days of Pop Warner,
Stanford coaches have worried
about admissions standards. Ander
son tried to understand the process
by putting himself in an admissions
officer's shoes.
"After being here just a short
time, we started to get kids denied
or we found about a couple kids who
had already been denied right be
fore we got here, and it was really in
teresting looking into that why
some of those kids were denied and
what the situation was," Anderson
said. "Really, going through that
first recruiting class, it really be
came evident to me that, boy, it's im
portant to get on kids early and
make sure they understand what all
the academic requirements are, in
terms of the classes we're looking
for them to take, the kind of test
scores we're looking for.
"There's not a magic number
[where] okay, they get to this, and
they're going to get in," Anderson
continued. "[The admissions office
is] also gonna put a lot of weight on
your application. How well did you
write the essays, how detailed and
thorough were you in filling every
thing else out, what did your teacher
recommendations say about you,
what did that counselor or score re
port, what did that say about you?"
What did that say about
you? Indeed, going beyond the
measurables SAT scores, 40-
yard dash, GPA, three-cone drill
was a view that both coaches and ad
missions officers could get behind.
Stanford football succeeded by
its working with the admissions of
fice. While academic requirements
did restrict Stanford's pool of poten
tial recruits, Anderson actually
credits the admissions process, as
well as the team's strength and con
ditioning regimen, with helping
Stanford's attrition rates. Every Di

vision I FBS team gets 85 scholar
ships a year; in a five-year stretch
from 2008 to 2012, Stanford only
signed 102 players. During that time
frame, Alabama signed 135. Addi
tionally, having to sign fewer re
cruits also depresses recruiting
rankings concealing how talent
ed Stanford's roster really is.
"[The admissions officers] want
to make sure that the kids who are
admitted here ... are able to be suc
cessful here. Not just get by, not just
survive, but that they are able to
succeed here," Anderson said re
cently. "You [might] think by relax
ing standards we can get better
players and stuff in, but in the long
term that's going to hurt you, be
cause those guys are going to have a
hard time graduating."
Indeed, recruiting standards
that were not commensurate with a
school's high academic standards

erable 47 percent of players within

fate.

sions," David Shaw told CBS.
"Lance was the first one to realize
