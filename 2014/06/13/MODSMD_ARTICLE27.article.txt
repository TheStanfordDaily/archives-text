"Two! Two! That's two! TWO!
TWOOOO!"
It wasn't just the trio of coach
es who rocketed out of their chairs
as if their seats had suddenly be
come red-hot, screaming at the
tops of their lungs for points to be
awarded while pointing at the two
tangled bodies on the far side of
the black mat. It was also the pair
of athletes standing behind their
coaches at the edge of the mat,
voicing their displeasure to the
referee as they jumped up and
down. And it was also the section
of fans clad in cardinal red that
bounded to its feet in unison,
yelling and gesturing, filling the
vastness of Maples Pavilion with
its collective voice.
The referee stared intently at
the squirming knot of bodies at his
feet, analyzing the placement of
the limbs, the forces being exerted
in all directions and the raw deter
mination of two individuals, each
straining with all his might to over
come the other.
All of a sudden, his right hand
shot up, two fingers pointed sky
ward, extensions of an arm
wrapped with a red sweatband.
Tivo points, red.
The whistle signaling the break
of the tie and the end of the
match was lost in the over
whelming roar that arose from the
small Stanford section of the
bleachers. Although there couldn't
have been more than 200 of them,
the din that they raised was akin to
the pandemonium after a game
winning buzzer-beater or a walk
off home run.
Senior Dan Scherer stood in
the center of the mat with an ex
hausted yet triumphant grin, hand
held high by the referee signaling
his victory one more tally in the
most successful season in team
history and one final conquest in
front of the Stanford faithful.
On Sunday, that roar inside
Maples Pavilion wasn't for a dou
ble alley-oop for Cardinal men's
basketball, nor was it for another
conference title for women's bas
ketball. Instead, it was in recogni
tion of Stanford wrestling a
team largely overlooked and for
gotten that had faded into relative
obscurity on campus â€”because
on Sunday, with the Pac-12 Cham
pionships held on the Farm for the
first time since 2006, the team
capped off a regular season in
which it thundered back to rele
vance, establishing a presence
that looks to be here to stay.

Walking into the wrestling
room in the basement of the Arril
laga Family Sports Center two

days before the Pac-12 Champi
onship, you can feel it in the air. No,
not the hint of stale sweat left over
from tireless weeks of preparation.
You can feel the energy, the buzz
and the camaraderie of the group
of individuals sprawled out on the
dull red mat. Looking around, you
get the sense that the term "group
of individuals" doesn't quite do jus
tice to the young men completely at
ease throwing around playful ban
ter or casually practicing pinning
each other. This is a team, in every
sense of the term.
From the 5-foot-2, 125-pound
Ryan Silver to the 6-foot-1, 285-
pound Josh Marchok, the mem
bers of this team have forged a
bond through their combined suc
cesses and failures in a historic sea
son, one in which they are looking
to capture the first conference title
in school history after breaking the
school record for the most dual
meet wins in a season. For veterans
like fifth-year senior Ryan Mango,
the season has been a testament to
just how much the program has im
proved in such a short period of
time from just eight dual wins
during the 2008-09 season to 17
this season.
"When I first came here, that
was really the emphasis, even
when I was being recruited here,"
Mango said. "[Head coach Jason]
Borrelli emphasized trying to turn
the program around and being in a
program that's respected, and re
ally making that change happen
rather than talking about it. So
throughout the past four or five
years, we've had our ups and
downs and... it's finally paying off
a little bit this year."
Mango is one of the established
leaders of the team. A two-time
All-American and three-time com
petitor at national tournaments, he
is one of the most experienced
wrestlers in the country and will be
looking to claim his second consec
utive Pac-12 title after redshirting
his senior year while moving up
weight classes from 125 pounds to
133. While his 106 career wins
speak for themselves. Even more
so, it's his maturity and persever
ance outside competition that have
been significant to not only the
team, but also to the development
of head coach Jason Borrelli,
whose young coaching career was
profoundly affected by Mango's
actions during the wrestler's time
at Stanford.
"You'd like to think as a coach
that you're doing a lot of teaching
and coaching, but Ryan has actual
ly helped our coaching staff in so
many ways," Borrelli said. "Little
things about persevering through
injuries, and for me as a young
coach who was still trying t0... fig
ure out the mindset of a student
athlete, Ryan is one of the first kids

round, a victory that sent fans at Maples Pavilion into a frenzy.
that I remember kind of changed
the expectations that I've put on
young kids."
Mango particularly impacted
Borrelli's mindset during his sopho
more year, when he was injured lead
ing up to the national tournament
and was strongly discouraged by
doctors from wrestling at the cham
pionships after not having trained
for several weeks. But Mango just
wouldn't give in. He wanted to be an
All-American, and partially torn lig
aments weren't going to stop him
from achieving his goal.
"I'm sitting here trying to tell
him he's not going to be able to wres
tle and he can't be an All-American,"
Borrelli said. "And he's telling me
the exact opposite, and I grew a lot
as a coach and I recognized that
there are kids that are motivated at
a different level at that age. For a
long time, I thought that a kid didn't
reach that until he was much older.
And so now as a coach, the expecta
tion from our staff has been, you
come in as a freshman and you ex
pect to win."
Mango competed at the NCAA
Championship that year wearing
knee braces. He finished sixth in the
125-pound tournament and
achieved his goal of earning All-
American honors.
This toughness symbolized a
turning point and resurgence in
Stanford wrestling, a dramatic turn
around fueled at least in part by the
success of a young Ryan Mango and
its effect on a young head coach, as
well as the emergence of star
wrestler and NCAA Championship
runner-up Nick Amuchastegui 'll.
The increased expectations placed
on freshmen, spurred by the devel
opment of that 2009 recruiting class
Mango, Kyle Meyer and Bret
Baumbach and the mutual learn
ing between player and coach are es
pecially evident in the 2014 team, set
to be one of the best if not the
best in school history.
"We came in, and we were the
worst team in the Pac-12 and we

were pretty far down there coming
in my freshman year," Meyer said.
"To kind of see the atmosphere and
see the people coming in behind us
the new recruits, they're just get
ting better and better. And it's excit
ing that we started the legacy...
We're starting a new decade of Stan
ford wrestling being in the top 25, at
least, and competing for a national
championship at the NCAAs."

This year's Stanford wrestling
squad marked the convergence of
two critical groups the seniors
who had paved the way for freshmen
to excel, and the freshmen who em
braced their potential to help turn
over a new leaf for the program.
With the groups coming together, a
distinct dynamic emerged in which
the entities mutually aided one an
other: While the veterans helped
ease the freshmen's transition into
the collegiate game, the freshmen,
in turn, helped the veterans by
bringing a new spark to the team
that quickly became infectious and
motivating.
"I don't think our seniors and
juniors view our freshmen as fresh
men, although they are," Borrelli
said. "They view them as guys who
can do really well. And so when that
happens, it just brings a different
mindset to the whole program ... In
just having one or two freshmen
that are having really good years, it
motivates everybody."
"It's my fifth year here, so I've
gone through a lot of grind," Meyer
added. "Next year, I don't have to do
the three-mile run or this workout
or really grueling stuff, but when
you look at those [young] guys,
they're really excited, and it brings
in, 'hey, wrestling is fun and compet
ing is fun,' so it kind of helps bring it
back into perspective."
Not only did the freshmen bring
with them confident and enthusias
tic mindsets, they also brought su
perb talent that made an immediate
impact on the team. The youth
movement was led by redshirt
freshman Jim Wilson, who finished
the season ranked 18th in the coun
try in the 165-pound weight class.
Armed with the talent to make a
big splash in the standings, Borrelli
and the Cardinal plunged into the

season with confidence and excite
ment, hoping that a deeper roster
would lead them back to national
prominence.
"We set a goal at the beginning of
the year to make this kind of a year
of firsts," Borrelli said. "A season of
firsts, meaning that we wanted to
win the first conference champi
onship, we wanted to have the most
dual meet victories in a season, we
wanted to send the most individuals
to the national tournament."
After the Cardinal easily put
away dual victories over Cal Baptist,
Menlo College and Air Force to open
the season before scraping past
Maryland, it pulled off a tough road
upset of then-No. 17 Michigan that
Wilson identified as a defining point
in the season.
"Coach Borrelli had told us how
good we could be and we'd done all
the training," Wilson said. "I think
when we beat Michigan, it was a re
alization. Everyone went, 'Oh, wow.
We can actually hang in there with
those guys. We can beat those best
teams.' So it was like the first step in
everyone realizing, 'Wow, we can ac
tually do this.'"
Even though the Cardinal hit its
share of bumps while it plowed
through its dual schedule, Borrelli
saw the potential in his team and be
lieved that the team's ability to
bounce back from tough losses dis
played a maturity and resilience
demonstrative of its mental tough
ness, which was another element
that set it apart from the teams of
years past.
"We have just never fallen too
far, even when we've gotten knocked
down," Borrelli said. "I was interest
ed to see how we were going to re
spond [to tough losses], and we
never stayed down. Every time we
got knocked down, it took us only the
next match to get back up... That's
when you know our kids' minds are
strong."
And indeed, the Cardinal never
dropped consecutive matches while
navigating itself to a 17-5 dual meet
record to set the new school record
for dual victories in a season, and
three of its losses were decided by
less than ten points. With wins over
schools like Michigan, Central
Michigan and Boise State, the Car

dinal indeed showed itself â€”and
the nation that it could contend
with some of the best teams in the
country.
Although the Cardinal caught a
solid groove towards the end of its
season as it rolled to eight straight
dual victories in a one-month stretch
spanning late January and early
February, it suffered a major set
back when senior Bret Baumbach,
co-captain and defending Pac-12
title winner, suffered a knee injury
that cut his career short and sent
him to the bench for the rest of the
season. With the loss of Baumbach,
the Cardinal was down one of its
stalwart cornerstones.
In the wake of such a significant
loss, the Cardinal could have folded
and allowed the forfeiture of Baum
bach's production on the mat to hin
der its progress moving into the fi
nale of its season.
"If Bret had pity on himself, it
would have hurt the team," Wilson
said.
But Baumbach, who had seen
and experienced the meteoric trans
formation of the program firsthand
during his five years as a Stanford
wrestler, refused to drag the team
down with him and made the most of
an unfortunate turn of events with
his leadership and positivity. If he
couldn't make an impact on the mat,
he was going to be sure to make an
impact off of it.
"Even though he tore both liga
ments in his knee and he was com
pletely out, he'd come in every day,
giving everybody high-fives, telling
them how great they were going to
do, giving guys back massages, try
ing to keep them loose and pumping
everybody up," Wilson said. "Bret's
just such an incredible guy that he
took that injury and just turned it
into a ton of positive energy just to
try to uplift the entire team. It was
really through Bret's example that
built everybody up."
The record-breaking season, the
shared perspective and Baumbach's
injury served to unite Stanford's
squad into an inseparable brother
hood as the Pac-12 Championship
rapidly approached, representing
the seniors' final chance to see their
efforts come to fruition with the
first-ever conference championship

in school history. And making the
stage even more fitting, the champi
onship was to be held at Stanford for
the first time since 2006, giving the
seniors the opportunity to make his
tory in front of the home crowd that
had meant so much to them over the
last five years.
"I think to the young kids, [a con
ference championship] might not
mean as much because they're
freshmen and sophomores, and they
feel like they have other opportuni
ties to win it," Borrelli added. "But I
think for our seniors, it's really
meaningful. To be at home and have
a chance to do it here, that would
mean a lot to the guys."
In a season that Borrelli wanted
to define through "firsts," the Cardi
nal had already accomplished one of
its goals: It had set the new record
for most dual wins in a season. And
with both the veterans and younger
wrestlers in peak condition and
looking forward to wrestling in front
of them home fans, the time seemed
ripe for more history to be made
going into the Pac-12 Champi
onship.
But arguably, even more signifi
cant than that was another first that
could not necessarily go down in the
record books like dual wins or con
ference championships the in
credibly strong bond and sense of
unity that the team possessed after
having navigated the peaks and val
leys of the season as a cohesive unit.
"Anyone would give the shirt off
his back to another guy," Wilson
said. "We trust each other; everyone
trusts each other completely, every
one's really close. It's definitely just
the way you would feel about a
brother. I mean, you trust your
brother, you die for your brother,
you'd do anything for your brother.
And that's just the way the whole
team is."

ripe for more history to be made
going into the Pac-12 Champi
onship.
But arguably, even more signifi
cant than that was another first that
could not necessarily go down in the
record books like dual wins or con
ference championships the in
credibly strong bond and sense of
unity that the team possessed after
having navigated the peaks and val
leys of the season as a cohesive unit.
"Anyone would give the shirt off
his back to another guy," Wilson
said. "We trust each other; everyone
trusts each other completely, every
one's really close. It's definitely just
the way you would feel about a
brother. I mean, you trust your
brother, you die for your brother,
you'd do anything for your brother.
And that's just the way the whole
team is."

"Two! Two! That's two! TWO!
TWOOOO!"
It wasn't just the trio of coach
es who rocketed out of their chairs
as if their seats had suddenly be
come red-hot, screaming at the
tops of their lungs for points to be
awarded while pointing at the two
tangled bodies on the far side of
the black mat. It was also the pair
of athletes standing behind their
coaches at the edge of the mat,
voicing their displeasure to the
referee as they jumped up and
down. And it was also the section
of fans clad in cardinal red that
bounded to its feet in unison,
yelling and gesturing, filling the
vastness of Maples Pavilion with
its collective voice.
The referee stared intently at
the squirming knot of bodies at his
feet, analyzing the placement of
the limbs, the forces being exerted
in all directions and the raw deter
mination of two individuals, each
straining with all his might to over
come the other.
All of a sudden, his right hand
shot up, two fingers pointed sky
ward, extensions of an arm
wrapped with a red sweatband.
Tivo points, red.
The whistle signaling the break
of the tie and the end of the
match was lost in the over
whelming roar that arose from the
small Stanford section of the
bleachers. Although there couldn't
have been more than 200 of them,
the din that they raised was akin to
the pandemonium after a game
winning buzzer-beater or a walk
off home run.
Senior Dan Scherer stood in
the center of the mat with an ex
hausted yet triumphant grin, hand
held high by the referee signaling
his victory one more tally in the
most successful season in team
history and one final conquest in
front of the Stanford faithful.
On Sunday, that roar inside
Maples Pavilion wasn't for a dou
ble alley-oop for Cardinal men's
basketball, nor was it for another
conference title for women's bas
ketball. Instead, it was in recogni
tion of Stanford wrestling a
team largely overlooked and for
gotten that had faded into relative
obscurity on campus â€”because
on Sunday, with the Pac-12 Cham
pionships held on the Farm for the
first time since 2006, the team
capped off a regular season in
which it thundered back to rele
vance, establishing a presence
that looks to be here to stay.

Walking into the wrestling
room in the basement of the Arril
laga Family Sports Center two

days before the Pac-12 Champi
onship, you can feel it in the air. No,
not the hint of stale sweat left over
from tireless weeks of preparation.
You can feel the energy, the buzz
and the camaraderie of the group
of individuals sprawled out on the
dull red mat. Looking around, you
get the sense that the term "group
of individuals" doesn't quite do jus
tice to the young men completely at
ease throwing around playful ban
ter or casually practicing pinning
each other. This is a team, in every
sense of the term.
From the 5-foot-2, 125-pound
Ryan Silver to the 6-foot-1, 285-
pound Josh Marchok, the mem
bers of this team have forged a
bond through their combined suc
cesses and failures in a historic sea
son, one in which they are looking
to capture the first conference title
in school history after breaking the
school record for the most dual
meet wins in a season. For veterans
like fifth-year senior Ryan Mango,
the season has been a testament to
just how much the program has im
proved in such a short period of
time from just eight dual wins
during the 2008-09 season to 17
this season.
"When I first came here, that
was really the emphasis, even
when I was being recruited here,"
Mango said. "[Head coach Jason]
Borrelli emphasized trying to turn
the program around and being in a
program that's respected, and re
ally making that change happen
rather than talking about it. So
throughout the past four or five
years, we've had our ups and
downs and... it's finally paying off
a little bit this year."
Mango is one of the established
leaders of the team. A two-time
All-American and three-time com
petitor at national tournaments, he
is one of the most experienced
wrestlers in the country and will be
looking to claim his second consec
utive Pac-12 title after redshirting
his senior year while moving up
weight classes from 125 pounds to
133. While his 106 career wins
speak for themselves. Even more
so, it's his maturity and persever
ance outside competition that have
been significant to not only the
team, but also to the development
of head coach Jason Borrelli,
whose young coaching career was
profoundly affected by Mango's
actions during the wrestler's time
at Stanford.
"You'd like to think as a coach
that you're doing a lot of teaching
and coaching, but Ryan has actual
ly helped our coaching staff in so
many ways," Borrelli said. "Little
things about persevering through
injuries, and for me as a young
coach who was still trying t0... fig
ure out the mindset of a student
athlete, Ryan is one of the first kids

round, a victory that sent fans at Maples Pavilion into a frenzy.
that I remember kind of changed
the expectations that I've put on
young kids."
Mango particularly impacted
Borrelli's mindset during his sopho
more year, when he was injured lead
ing up to the national tournament
and was strongly discouraged by
doctors from wrestling at the cham
pionships after not having trained
for several weeks. But Mango just
wouldn't give in. He wanted to be an
All-American, and partially torn lig
aments weren't going to stop him
from achieving his goal.
"I'm sitting here trying to tell
him he's not going to be able to wres
tle and he can't be an All-American,"
Borrelli said. "And he's telling me
the exact opposite, and I grew a lot
as a coach and I recognized that
there are kids that are motivated at
a different level at that age. For a
long time, I thought that a kid didn't
reach that until he was much older.
And so now as a coach, the expecta
tion from our staff has been, you
come in as a freshman and you ex
pect to win."
Mango competed at the NCAA
Championship that year wearing
knee braces. He finished sixth in the
125-pound tournament and
achieved his goal of earning All-
American honors.
This toughness symbolized a
turning point and resurgence in
Stanford wrestling, a dramatic turn
around fueled at least in part by the
success of a young Ryan Mango and
its effect on a young head coach, as
well as the emergence of star
wrestler and NCAA Championship
runner-up Nick Amuchastegui 'll.
The increased expectations placed
on freshmen, spurred by the devel
opment of that 2009 recruiting class
Mango, Kyle Meyer and Bret
Baumbach and the mutual learn
ing between player and coach are es
pecially evident in the 2014 team, set
to be one of the best if not the
best in school history.
"We came in, and we were the
worst team in the Pac-12 and we

were pretty far down there coming
in my freshman year," Meyer said.
"To kind of see the atmosphere and
see the people coming in behind us
the new recruits, they're just get
ting better and better. And it's excit
ing that we started the legacy...
We're starting a new decade of Stan
ford wrestling being in the top 25, at
least, and competing for a national
championship at the NCAAs."

This year's Stanford wrestling
squad marked the convergence of
two critical groups the seniors
who had paved the way for freshmen
to excel, and the freshmen who em
braced their potential to help turn
over a new leaf for the program.
With the groups coming together, a
distinct dynamic emerged in which
the entities mutually aided one an
other: While the veterans helped
ease the freshmen's transition into
the collegiate game, the freshmen,
in turn, helped the veterans by
bringing a new spark to the team
that quickly became infectious and
motivating.
"I don't think our seniors and
juniors view our freshmen as fresh
men, although they are," Borrelli
said. "They view them as guys who
can do really well. And so when that
happens, it just brings a different
mindset to the whole program ... In
just having one or two freshmen
that are having really good years, it
motivates everybody."
"It's my fifth year here, so I've
gone through a lot of grind," Meyer
added. "Next year, I don't have to do
the three-mile run or this workout
or really grueling stuff, but when
you look at those [young] guys,
they're really excited, and it brings
in, 'hey, wrestling is fun and compet
ing is fun,' so it kind of helps bring it
back into perspective."
Not only did the freshmen bring
with them confident and enthusias
tic mindsets, they also brought su
perb talent that made an immediate
impact on the team. The youth
movement was led by redshirt
freshman Jim Wilson, who finished
the season ranked 18th in the coun
try in the 165-pound weight class.
Armed with the talent to make a
big splash in the standings, Borrelli
and the Cardinal plunged into the

season with confidence and excite
ment, hoping that a deeper roster
would lead them back to national
prominence.
"We set a goal at the beginning of
the year to make this kind of a year
of firsts," Borrelli said. "A season of
firsts, meaning that we wanted to
win the first conference champi
onship, we wanted to have the most
dual meet victories in a season, we
wanted to send the most individuals
to the national tournament."
After the Cardinal easily put
away dual victories over Cal Baptist,
Menlo College and Air Force to open
the season before scraping past
Maryland, it pulled off a tough road
upset of then-No. 17 Michigan that
Wilson identified as a defining point
in the season.
"Coach Borrelli had told us how
good we could be and we'd done all
the training," Wilson said. "I think
when we beat Michigan, it was a re
alization. Everyone went, 'Oh, wow.
We can actually hang in there with
those guys. We can beat those best
teams.' So it was like the first step in
everyone realizing, 'Wow, we can ac
tually do this.'"
Even though the Cardinal hit its
share of bumps while it plowed
through its dual schedule, Borrelli
saw the potential in his team and be
lieved that the team's ability to
bounce back from tough losses dis
played a maturity and resilience
demonstrative of its mental tough
ness, which was another element
that set it apart from the teams of
years past.
"We have just never fallen too
far, even when we've gotten knocked
down," Borrelli said. "I was interest
ed to see how we were going to re
spond [to tough losses], and we
never stayed down. Every time we
got knocked down, it took us only the
next match to get back up... That's
when you know our kids' minds are
strong."
And indeed, the Cardinal never
dropped consecutive matches while
navigating itself to a 17-5 dual meet
record to set the new school record
for dual victories in a season, and
three of its losses were decided by
less than ten points. With wins over
schools like Michigan, Central
Michigan and Boise State, the Car

dinal indeed showed itself â€”and
the nation that it could contend
with some of the best teams in the
country.
Although the Cardinal caught a
solid groove towards the end of its
season as it rolled to eight straight
dual victories in a one-month stretch
spanning late January and early
February, it suffered a major set
back when senior Bret Baumbach,
co-captain and defending Pac-12
title winner, suffered a knee injury
that cut his career short and sent
him to the bench for the rest of the
season. With the loss of Baumbach,
the Cardinal was down one of its
stalwart cornerstones.
In the wake of such a significant
loss, the Cardinal could have folded
and allowed the forfeiture of Baum
bach's production on the mat to hin
der its progress moving into the fi
nale of its season.
"If Bret had pity on himself, it
would have hurt the team," Wilson
said.
But Baumbach, who had seen
and experienced the meteoric trans
formation of the program firsthand
during his five years as a Stanford
wrestler, refused to drag the team
down with him and made the most of
an unfortunate turn of events with
his leadership and positivity. If he
couldn't make an impact on the mat,
he was going to be sure to make an
impact off of it.
"Even though he tore both liga
ments in his knee and he was com
pletely out, he'd come in every day,
giving everybody high-fives, telling
them how great they were going to
do, giving guys back massages, try
ing to keep them loose and pumping
everybody up," Wilson said. "Bret's
just such an incredible guy that he
took that injury and just turned it
into a ton of positive energy just to
try to uplift the entire team. It was
really through Bret's example that
built everybody up."
The record-breaking season, the
shared perspective and Baumbach's
injury served to unite Stanford's
squad into an inseparable brother
hood as the Pac-12 Championship
rapidly approached, representing
the seniors' final chance to see their
efforts come to fruition with the
first-ever conference championship

in school history. And making the
stage even more fitting, the champi
onship was to be held at Stanford for
the first time since 2006, giving the
seniors the opportunity to make his
tory in front of the home crowd that
had meant so much to them over the
last five years.
"I think to the young kids, [a con
ference championship] might not
mean as much because they're
freshmen and sophomores, and they
feel like they have other opportuni
ties to win it," Borrelli added. "But I
think for our seniors, it's really
meaningful. To be at home and have
a chance to do it here, that would
mean a lot to the guys."
In a season that Borrelli wanted
to define through "firsts," the Cardi
nal had already accomplished one of
its goals: It had set the new record
for most dual wins in a season. And
with both the veterans and younger
wrestlers in peak condition and
looking forward to wrestling in front
of them home fans, the time seemed
ripe for more history to be made
going into the Pac-12 Champi
onship.
But arguably, even more signifi
cant than that was another first that
could not necessarily go down in the
record books like dual wins or con
ference championships the in
credibly strong bond and sense of
unity that the team possessed after
having navigated the peaks and val
leys of the season as a cohesive unit.

rapidly approached, representing
the seniors' final chance to see their
efforts come to fruition with the
first-ever conference championship

in school history. And making the
stage even more fitting, the champi
onship was to be held at Stanford for
the first time since 2006, giving the
seniors the opportunity to make his
tory in front of the home crowd that
had meant so much to them over the
last five years.
"I think to the young kids, [a con
ference championship] might not
mean as much because they're
freshmen and sophomores, and they
feel like they have other opportuni
ties to win it," Borrelli added. "But I
think for our seniors, it's really
meaningful. To be at home and have
a chance to do it here, that would
mean a lot to the guys."
In a season that Borrelli wanted
to define through "firsts," the Cardi
nal had already accomplished one of
its goals: It had set the new record
for most dual wins in a season. And
with both the veterans and younger
wrestlers in peak condition and
looking forward to wrestling in front
of them home fans, the time seemed
ripe for more history to be made
going into the Pac-12 Champi
onship.
But arguably, even more signifi
cant than that was another first that
could not necessarily go down in the
record books like dual wins or con
ference championships the in
credibly strong bond and sense of
unity that the team possessed after
having navigated the peaks and val
leys of the season as a cohesive unit.
"Anyone would give the shirt off
his back to another guy," Wilson
said. "We trust each other; everyone
trusts each other completely, every
one's really close. It's definitely just
the way you would feel about a
brother. I mean, you trust your
brother, you die for your brother,
you'd do anything for your brother.
And that's just the way the whole
team is."

TWOOOO!"
It wasn't just the trio of coach
es who rocketed out of their chairs
as if their seats had suddenly be
come red-hot, screaming at the
tops of their lungs for points to be
awarded while pointing at the two
tangled bodies on the far side of
the black mat. It was also the pair
of athletes standing behind their
coaches at the edge of the mat,
voicing their displeasure to the
referee as they jumped up and
down. And it was also the section
of fans clad in cardinal red that
bounded to its feet in unison,
yelling and gesturing, filling the
vastness of Maples Pavilion with
its collective voice.
The referee stared intently at
the squirming knot of bodies at his
feet, analyzing the placement of
the limbs, the forces being exerted
in all directions and the raw deter
mination of two individuals, each
straining with all his might to over
come the other.
All of a sudden, his right hand
shot up, two fingers pointed sky
ward, extensions of an arm
wrapped with a red sweatband.
Tivo points, red.
The whistle signaling the break
of the tie and the end of the
match was lost in the over
whelming roar that arose from the
small Stanford section of the
bleachers. Although there couldn't
have been more than 200 of them,
the din that they raised was akin to
the pandemonium after a game
winning buzzer-beater or a walk
off home run.
Senior Dan Scherer stood in
the center of the mat with an ex
hausted yet triumphant grin, hand
held high by the referee signaling
his victory one more tally in the
most successful season in team
history and one final conquest in
front of the Stanford faithful.
On Sunday, that roar inside
Maples Pavilion wasn't for a dou
ble alley-oop for Cardinal men's
basketball, nor was it for another
conference title for women's bas
ketball. Instead, it was in recogni
tion of Stanford wrestling a
team largely overlooked and for
gotten that had faded into relative
obscurity on campus â€”because
on Sunday, with the Pac-12 Cham
pionships held on the Farm for the
first time since 2006, the team
capped off a regular season in
which it thundered back to rele
vance, establishing a presence
that looks to be here to stay.

Walking into the wrestling
room in the basement of the Arril
laga Family Sports Center two

days before the Pac-12 Champi
onship, you can feel it in the air. No,
not the hint of stale sweat left over
from tireless weeks of preparation.
You can feel the energy, the buzz
and the camaraderie of the group
of individuals sprawled out on the
dull red mat. Looking around, you
get the sense that the term "group
of individuals" doesn't quite do jus
tice to the young men completely at
ease throwing around playful ban
ter or casually practicing pinning
each other. This is a team, in every
sense of the term.
From the 5-foot-2, 125-pound
Ryan Silver to the 6-foot-1, 285-
pound Josh Marchok, the mem
bers of this team have forged a
bond through their combined suc
cesses and failures in a historic sea
son, one in which they are looking
to capture the first conference title
in school history after breaking the
school record for the most dual
meet wins in a season. For veterans
like fifth-year senior Ryan Mango,
the season has been a testament to
just how much the program has im
proved in such a short period of
time from just eight dual wins
during the 2008-09 season to 17
this season.
"When I first came here, that
was really the emphasis, even
when I was being recruited here,"
Mango said. "[Head coach Jason]
Borrelli emphasized trying to turn
the program around and being in a
program that's respected, and re
ally making that change happen
rather than talking about it. So
throughout the past four or five
years, we've had our ups and
downs and... it's finally paying off
a little bit this year."
Mango is one of the established
leaders of the team. A two-time
All-American and three-time com
petitor at national tournaments, he
is one of the most experienced
wrestlers in the country and will be
looking to claim his second consec
utive Pac-12 title after redshirting
his senior year while moving up
weight classes from 125 pounds to
133. While his 106 career wins
speak for themselves. Even more
so, it's his maturity and persever
ance outside competition that have
been significant to not only the
team, but also to the development
of head coach Jason Borrelli,
whose young coaching career was
profoundly affected by Mango's
actions during the wrestler's time
at Stanford.
"You'd like to think as a coach
that you're doing a lot of teaching
and coaching, but Ryan has actual
ly helped our coaching staff in so
many ways," Borrelli said. "Little
things about persevering through
injuries, and for me as a young
coach who was still trying t0... fig
ure out the mindset of a student
athlete, Ryan is one of the first kids

round, a victory that sent fans at Maples Pavilion into a frenzy.
that I remember kind of changed
the expectations that I've put on
young kids."
Mango particularly impacted
Borrelli's mindset during his sopho
more year, when he was injured lead
ing up to the national tournament
and was strongly discouraged by
doctors from wrestling at the cham
pionships after not having trained
for several weeks. But Mango just
wouldn't give in. He wanted to be an
All-American, and partially torn lig
aments weren't going to stop him
from achieving his goal.
"I'm sitting here trying to tell
him he's not going to be able to wres
tle and he can't be an All-American,"
Borrelli said. "And he's telling me
the exact opposite, and I grew a lot
as a coach and I recognized that
there are kids that are motivated at
a different level at that age. For a
long time, I thought that a kid didn't
reach that until he was much older.
And so now as a coach, the expecta
tion from our staff has been, you
come in as a freshman and you ex
pect to win."
Mango competed at the NCAA
Championship that year wearing
knee braces. He finished sixth in the
125-pound tournament and
achieved his goal of earning All-
American honors.
This toughness symbolized a
turning point and resurgence in
Stanford wrestling, a dramatic turn
around fueled at least in part by the
success of a young Ryan Mango and
its effect on a young head coach, as
well as the emergence of star
wrestler and NCAA Championship
runner-up Nick Amuchastegui 'll.
The increased expectations placed
on freshmen, spurred by the devel
opment of that 2009 recruiting class
Mango, Kyle Meyer and Bret
Baumbach and the mutual learn
ing between player and coach are es
pecially evident in the 2014 team, set
to be one of the best if not the
best in school history.
"We came in, and we were the
worst team in the Pac-12 and we

were pretty far down there coming
in my freshman year," Meyer said.
"To kind of see the atmosphere and
see the people coming in behind us
the new recruits, they're just get
ting better and better. And it's excit
ing that we started the legacy...
We're starting a new decade of Stan
ford wrestling being in the top 25, at
least, and competing for a national
championship at the NCAAs."

This year's Stanford wrestling
squad marked the convergence of
two critical groups the seniors
who had paved the way for freshmen
to excel, and the freshmen who em
braced their potential to help turn
over a new leaf for the program.
With the groups coming together, a
distinct dynamic emerged in which
the entities mutually aided one an
other: While the veterans helped
ease the freshmen's transition into
the collegiate game, the freshmen,
in turn, helped the veterans by
bringing a new spark to the team
that quickly became infectious and
motivating.
"I don't think our seniors and
juniors view our freshmen as fresh
men, although they are," Borrelli
said. "They view them as guys who
can do really well. And so when that
happens, it just brings a different
mindset to the whole program ... In
just having one or two freshmen
that are having really good years, it
motivates everybody."
"It's my fifth year here, so I've
gone through a lot of grind," Meyer
added. "Next year, I don't have to do
the three-mile run or this workout
or really grueling stuff, but when
you look at those [young] guys,
they're really excited, and it brings
in, 'hey, wrestling is fun and compet
ing is fun,' so it kind of helps bring it
back into perspective."
Not only did the freshmen bring
with them confident and enthusias
tic mindsets, they also brought su
perb talent that made an immediate
impact on the team. The youth
movement was led by redshirt
freshman Jim Wilson, who finished
the season ranked 18th in the coun
try in the 165-pound weight class.
Armed with the talent to make a
big splash in the standings, Borrelli
and the Cardinal plunged into the

season with confidence and excite
ment, hoping that a deeper roster
would lead them back to national
prominence.
"We set a goal at the beginning of
the year to make this kind of a year
of firsts," Borrelli said. "A season of
firsts, meaning that we wanted to
win the first conference champi
onship, we wanted to have the most
dual meet victories in a season, we
wanted to send the most individuals
to the national tournament."
After the Cardinal easily put
away dual victories over Cal Baptist,
Menlo College and Air Force to open
the season before scraping past
Maryland, it pulled off a tough road
upset of then-No. 17 Michigan that
Wilson identified as a defining point
in the season.
"Coach Borrelli had told us how
good we could be and we'd done all
the training," Wilson said. "I think
when we beat Michigan, it was a re
alization. Everyone went, 'Oh, wow.
We can actually hang in there with
those guys. We can beat those best
teams.' So it was like the first step in
everyone realizing, 'Wow, we can ac
tually do this.'"
Even though the Cardinal hit its
share of bumps while it plowed
through its dual schedule, Borrelli
saw the potential in his team and be
lieved that the team's ability to
bounce back from tough losses dis
played a maturity and resilience
demonstrative of its mental tough
ness, which was another element
that set it apart from the teams of
years past.
"We have just never fallen too
far, even when we've gotten knocked
down," Borrelli said. "I was interest
ed to see how we were going to re
spond [to tough losses], and we
never stayed down. Every time we
got knocked down, it took us only the
next match to get back up... That's
when you know our kids' minds are
strong."
And indeed, the Cardinal never
dropped consecutive matches while
navigating itself to a 17-5 dual meet
record to set the new school record
for dual victories in a season, and
three of its losses were decided by
less than ten points. With wins over
schools like Michigan, Central
Michigan and Boise State, the Car

dinal indeed showed itself â€”and
the nation that it could contend
with some of the best teams in the
country.
Although the Cardinal caught a
solid groove towards the end of its
season as it rolled to eight straight
dual victories in a one-month stretch
spanning late January and early
February, it suffered a major set
back when senior Bret Baumbach,
co-captain and defending Pac-12
title winner, suffered a knee injury
that cut his career short and sent
him to the bench for the rest of the
season. With the loss of Baumbach,
the Cardinal was down one of its
stalwart cornerstones.
In the wake of such a significant
loss, the Cardinal could have folded
and allowed the forfeiture of Baum
bach's production on the mat to hin
der its progress moving into the fi
nale of its season.
"If Bret had pity on himself, it
would have hurt the team," Wilson
said.
But Baumbach, who had seen
and experienced the meteoric trans
formation of the program firsthand
during his five years as a Stanford
wrestler, refused to drag the team
down with him and made the most of
an unfortunate turn of events with
his leadership and positivity. If he
couldn't make an impact on the mat,
he was going to be sure to make an
impact off of it.
"Even though he tore both liga
ments in his knee and he was com
pletely out, he'd come in every day,
giving everybody high-fives, telling
them how great they were going to
do, giving guys back massages, try
ing to keep them loose and pumping
everybody up," Wilson said. "Bret's
just such an incredible guy that he
took that injury and just turned it
into a ton of positive energy just to
try to uplift the entire team. It was
really through Bret's example that
built everybody up."
The record-breaking season, the
shared perspective and Baumbach's
injury served to unite Stanford's
squad into an inseparable brother
hood as the Pac-12 Championship
rapidly approached, representing
the seniors' final chance to see their
efforts come to fruition with the
first-ever conference championship

in school history. And making the

would have hurt the team," Wilson
said.
But Baumbach, who had seen
and experienced the meteoric trans
formation of the program firsthand
during his five years as a Stanford
wrestler, refused to drag the team
down with him and made the most of
an unfortunate turn of events with
his leadership and positivity. If he
couldn't make an impact on the mat,
he was going to be sure to make an
impact off of it.
"Even though he tore both liga
ments in his knee and he was com
pletely out, he'd come in every day,
giving everybody high-fives, telling
them how great they were going to
do, giving guys back massages, try
ing to keep them loose and pumping
everybody up," Wilson said. "Bret's
just such an incredible guy that he
took that injury and just turned it
into a ton of positive energy just to
try to uplift the entire team. It was
really through Bret's example that
built everybody up."
The record-breaking season, the
shared perspective and Baumbach's
injury served to unite Stanford's
squad into an inseparable brother
hood as the Pac-12 Championship
rapidly approached, representing
the seniors' final chance to see their
efforts come to fruition with the
first-ever conference championship

in school history. And making the
stage even more fitting, the champi
onship was to be held at Stanford for
the first time since 2006, giving the
seniors the opportunity to make his
tory in front of the home crowd that
had meant so much to them over the
last five years.
"I think to the young kids, [a con
ference championship] might not
mean as much because they're
freshmen and sophomores, and they
feel like they have other opportuni
ties to win it," Borrelli added. "But I
think for our seniors, it's really
meaningful. To be at home and have
a chance to do it here, that would
mean a lot to the guys."
In a season that Borrelli wanted
to define through "firsts," the Cardi
nal had already accomplished one of
its goals: It had set the new record
for most dual wins in a season. And
with both the veterans and younger
wrestlers in peak condition and
looking forward to wrestling in front
of them home fans, the time seemed
ripe for more history to be made
going into the Pac-12 Champi
onship.
But arguably, even more signifi
cant than that was another first that
could not necessarily go down in the
record books like dual wins or con
ference championships the in
credibly strong bond and sense of
unity that the team possessed after
having navigated the peaks and val
leys of the season as a cohesive unit.
"Anyone would give the shirt off
his back to another guy," Wilson
said. "We trust each other; everyone
trusts each other completely, every
one's really close. It's definitely just
the way you would feel about a
brother. I mean, you trust your
brother, you die for your brother,
you'd do anything for your brother.
And that's just the way the whole
team is."

TWOOOO!"
It wasn't just the trio of coach
es who rocketed out of their chairs
as if their seats had suddenly be
come red-hot, screaming at the
tops of their lungs for points to be
awarded while pointing at the two
tangled bodies on the far side of
the black mat. It was also the pair
of athletes standing behind their
coaches at the edge of the mat,
voicing their displeasure to the
referee as they jumped up and
down. And it was also the section
of fans clad in cardinal red that
bounded to its feet in unison,
yelling and gesturing, filling the
vastness of Maples Pavilion with
its collective voice.
The referee stared intently at
the squirming knot of bodies at his
feet, analyzing the placement of
the limbs, the forces being exerted
in all directions and the raw deter
mination of two individuals, each
straining with all his might to over
come the other.
All of a sudden, his right hand
shot up, two fingers pointed sky
ward, extensions of an arm
wrapped with a red sweatband.
Tivo points, red.
The whistle signaling the break
of the tie and the end of the
match was lost in the over
whelming roar that arose from the
small Stanford section of the
bleachers. Although there couldn't
have been more than 200 of them,
the din that they raised was akin to
the pandemonium after a game
winning buzzer-beater or a walk
off home run.
Senior Dan Scherer stood in
the center of the mat with an ex
hausted yet triumphant grin, hand
held high by the referee signaling
his victory one more tally in the
most successful season in team
history and one final conquest in
front of the Stanford faithful.
On Sunday, that roar inside
Maples Pavilion wasn't for a dou
ble alley-oop for Cardinal men's
basketball, nor was it for another
conference title for women's bas
ketball. Instead, it was in recogni
tion of Stanford wrestling a
team largely overlooked and for
gotten that had faded into relative
obscurity on campus â€”because
on Sunday, with the Pac-12 Cham
pionships held on the Farm for the
first time since 2006, the team
capped off a regular season in
which it thundered back to rele
vance, establishing a presence
that looks to be here to stay.

Walking into the wrestling
room in the basement of the Arril
laga Family Sports Center two

days before the Pac-12 Champi
onship, you can feel it in the air. No,
not the hint of stale sweat left over
from tireless weeks of preparation.
You can feel the energy, the buzz
and the camaraderie of the group
of individuals sprawled out on the
dull red mat. Looking around, you
get the sense that the term "group
of individuals" doesn't quite do jus
tice to the young men completely at
ease throwing around playful ban
ter or casually practicing pinning
each other. This is a team, in every
sense of the term.
From the 5-foot-2, 125-pound
Ryan Silver to the 6-foot-1, 285-
pound Josh Marchok, the mem
bers of this team have forged a
bond through their combined suc
cesses and failures in a historic sea
son, one in which they are looking
to capture the first conference title
in school history after breaking the
school record for the most dual
meet wins in a season. For veterans
like fifth-year senior Ryan Mango,
the season has been a testament to
just how much the program has im
proved in such a short period of
time from just eight dual wins
during the 2008-09 season to 17
this season.
"When I first came here, that
was really the emphasis, even
when I was being recruited here,"
Mango said. "[Head coach Jason]
Borrelli emphasized trying to turn
the program around and being in a
program that's respected, and re
ally making that change happen
rather than talking about it. So
throughout the past four or five
years, we've had our ups and
downs and... it's finally paying off
a little bit this year."
Mango is one of the established
leaders of the team. A two-time
All-American and three-time com
petitor at national tournaments, he
is one of the most experienced
wrestlers in the country and will be
looking to claim his second consec
utive Pac-12 title after redshirting
his senior year while moving up
weight classes from 125 pounds to
133. While his 106 career wins
speak for themselves. Even more
so, it's his maturity and persever
ance outside competition that have
been significant to not only the
team, but also to the development
of head coach Jason Borrelli,
whose young coaching career was
profoundly affected by Mango's
actions during the wrestler's time
at Stanford.
"You'd like to think as a coach
that you're doing a lot of teaching
and coaching, but Ryan has actual
ly helped our coaching staff in so
many ways," Borrelli said. "Little
things about persevering through
injuries, and for me as a young
coach who was still trying t0... fig
ure out the mindset of a student
athlete, Ryan is one of the first kids

round, a victory that sent fans at Maples Pavilion into a frenzy.
that I remember kind of changed
the expectations that I've put on
young kids."
Mango particularly impacted
Borrelli's mindset during his sopho
more year, when he was injured lead
ing up to the national tournament
and was strongly discouraged by
doctors from wrestling at the cham
pionships after not having trained
for several weeks. But Mango just
wouldn't give in. He wanted to be an
All-American, and partially torn lig
aments weren't going to stop him
from achieving his goal.
"I'm sitting here trying to tell
him he's not going to be able to wres
tle and he can't be an All-American,"
Borrelli said. "And he's telling me
the exact opposite, and I grew a lot
as a coach and I recognized that
there are kids that are motivated at
a different level at that age. For a
long time, I thought that a kid didn't
reach that until he was much older.
And so now as a coach, the expecta
tion from our staff has been, you
come in as a freshman and you ex
pect to win."
Mango competed at the NCAA
Championship that year wearing
knee braces. He finished sixth in the
125-pound tournament and
achieved his goal of earning All-
American honors.
This toughness symbolized a
turning point and resurgence in
Stanford wrestling, a dramatic turn
around fueled at least in part by the
success of a young Ryan Mango and
its effect on a young head coach, as
well as the emergence of star
wrestler and NCAA Championship
runner-up Nick Amuchastegui 'll.
The increased expectations placed
on freshmen, spurred by the devel
opment of that 2009 recruiting class
Mango, Kyle Meyer and Bret
Baumbach and the mutual learn
ing between player and coach are es
pecially evident in the 2014 team, set
to be one of the best if not the
best in school history.
"We came in, and we were the
worst team in the Pac-12 and we

were pretty far down there coming
in my freshman year," Meyer said.
"To kind of see the atmosphere and
see the people coming in behind us
the new recruits, they're just get
ting better and better. And it's excit
ing that we started the legacy...
We're starting a new decade of Stan
ford wrestling being in the top 25, at
least, and competing for a national
championship at the NCAAs."

This year's Stanford wrestling
squad marked the convergence of
two critical groups the seniors
who had paved the way for freshmen
to excel, and the freshmen who em
braced their potential to help turn
over a new leaf for the program.
With the groups coming together, a
distinct dynamic emerged in which
the entities mutually aided one an
other: While the veterans helped
ease the freshmen's transition into
the collegiate game, the freshmen,
in turn, helped the veterans by
bringing a new spark to the team
that quickly became infectious and
motivating.
"I don't think our seniors and
juniors view our freshmen as fresh
men, although they are," Borrelli
said. "They view them as guys who
can do really well. And so when that
happens, it just brings a different
mindset to the whole program ... In
just having one or two freshmen
that are having really good years, it
motivates everybody."
"It's my fifth year here, so I've
gone through a lot of grind," Meyer
added. "Next year, I don't have to do
the three-mile run or this workout
or really grueling stuff, but when
you look at those [young] guys,
they're really excited, and it brings
in, 'hey, wrestling is fun and compet
ing is fun,' so it kind of helps bring it
back into perspective."
Not only did the freshmen bring
with them confident and enthusias
tic mindsets, they also brought su
perb talent that made an immediate
impact on the team. The youth
movement was led by redshirt
freshman Jim Wilson, who finished
the season ranked 18th in the coun
try in the 165-pound weight class.
Armed with the talent to make a
big splash in the standings, Borrelli
and the Cardinal plunged into the

season with confidence and excite
ment, hoping that a deeper roster
would lead them back to national
prominence.
"We set a goal at the beginning of
the year to make this kind of a year
of firsts," Borrelli said. "A season of
firsts, meaning that we wanted to
win the first conference champi
onship, we wanted to have the most
dual meet victories in a season, we
wanted to send the most individuals
to the national tournament."
After the Cardinal easily put
away dual victories over Cal Baptist,
Menlo College and Air Force to open
the season before scraping past
Maryland, it pulled off a tough road
upset of then-No. 17 Michigan that
Wilson identified as a defining point
in the season.
"Coach Borrelli had told us how
good we could be and we'd done all
the training," Wilson said. "I think
when we beat Michigan, it was a re
alization. Everyone went, 'Oh, wow.
We can actually hang in there with
those guys. We can beat those best
teams.' So it was like the first step in
everyone realizing, 'Wow, we can ac
tually do this.'"
Even though the Cardinal hit its
share of bumps while it plowed
through its dual schedule, Borrelli
saw the potential in his team and be
lieved that the team's ability to
bounce back from tough losses dis
played a maturity and resilience
demonstrative of its mental tough
ness, which was another element
that set it apart from the teams of
years past.
"We have just never fallen too
far, even when we've gotten knocked
down," Borrelli said. "I was interest
ed to see how we were going to re
spond [to tough losses], and we
never stayed down. Every time we
got knocked down, it took us only the
next match to get back up... That's
when you know our kids' minds are
strong."
And indeed, the Cardinal never
dropped consecutive matches while
navigating itself to a 17-5 dual meet
record to set the new school record
for dual victories in a season, and
three of its losses were decided by
less than ten points. With wins over
schools like Michigan, Central
Michigan and Boise State, the Car

dinal indeed showed itself â€”and
the nation that it could contend
with some of the best teams in the
country.
Although the Cardinal caught a
solid groove towards the end of its
season as it rolled to eight straight
dual victories in a one-month stretch
spanning late January and early
February, it suffered a major set
back when senior Bret Baumbach,
co-captain and defending Pac-12
title winner, suffered a knee injury
that cut his career short and sent
him to the bench for the rest of the
season. With the loss of Baumbach,
the Cardinal was down one of its
stalwart cornerstones.
In the wake of such a significant
loss, the Cardinal could have folded
and allowed the forfeiture of Baum
bach's production on the mat to hin
der its progress moving into the fi
nale of its season.
"If Bret had pity on himself, it
would have hurt the team," Wilson
said.
But Baumbach, who had seen
and experienced the meteoric trans
formation of the program firsthand
during his five years as a Stanford
wrestler, refused to drag the team
down with him and made the most of
an unfortunate turn of events with
his leadership and positivity. If he
couldn't make an impact on the mat,
he was going to be sure to make an
impact off of it.
"Even though he tore both liga
ments in his knee and he was com
pletely out, he'd come in every day,
giving everybody high-fives, telling

dropped consecutive matches while
navigating itself to a 17-5 dual meet
record to set the new school record
for dual victories in a season, and
three of its losses were decided by
less than ten points. With wins over
schools like Michigan, Central
Michigan and Boise State, the Car

dinal indeed showed itself â€”and
the nation that it could contend
with some of the best teams in the
country.
Although the Cardinal caught a
solid groove towards the end of its
season as it rolled to eight straight
dual victories in a one-month stretch
spanning late January and early
February, it suffered a major set
back when senior Bret Baumbach,
co-captain and defending Pac-12
title winner, suffered a knee injury
that cut his career short and sent
him to the bench for the rest of the
season. With the loss of Baumbach,
the Cardinal was down one of its
stalwart cornerstones.
In the wake of such a significant
loss, the Cardinal could have folded
and allowed the forfeiture of Baum
bach's production on the mat to hin
der its progress moving into the fi
nale of its season.
"If Bret had pity on himself, it
would have hurt the team," Wilson
said.
But Baumbach, who had seen
and experienced the meteoric trans
formation of the program firsthand
during his five years as a Stanford
wrestler, refused to drag the team
down with him and made the most of
an unfortunate turn of events with
his leadership and positivity. If he
couldn't make an impact on the mat,
he was going to be sure to make an
impact off of it.
"Even though he tore both liga
ments in his knee and he was com
pletely out, he'd come in every day,
giving everybody high-fives, telling
them how great they were going to
do, giving guys back massages, try
ing to keep them loose and pumping
everybody up," Wilson said. "Bret's
just such an incredible guy that he
took that injury and just turned it
into a ton of positive energy just to
try to uplift the entire team. It was
really through Bret's example that
built everybody up."
The record-breaking season, the
shared perspective and Baumbach's
injury served to unite Stanford's
squad into an inseparable brother
hood as the Pac-12 Championship
rapidly approached, representing
the seniors' final chance to see their
efforts come to fruition with the
first-ever conference championship

in school history. And making the
stage even more fitting, the champi
onship was to be held at Stanford for
the first time since 2006, giving the
seniors the opportunity to make his
tory in front of the home crowd that
had meant so much to them over the
last five years.
"I think to the young kids, [a con
ference championship] might not
mean as much because they're
freshmen and sophomores, and they
feel like they have other opportuni
ties to win it," Borrelli added. "But I
think for our seniors, it's really
meaningful. To be at home and have
a chance to do it here, that would
mean a lot to the guys."
In a season that Borrelli wanted
to define through "firsts," the Cardi
nal had already accomplished one of
its goals: It had set the new record
for most dual wins in a season. And
with both the veterans and younger
wrestlers in peak condition and
looking forward to wrestling in front
of them home fans, the time seemed
ripe for more history to be made
going into the Pac-12 Champi
onship.
But arguably, even more signifi
cant than that was another first that
could not necessarily go down in the
record books like dual wins or con
ference championships the in
credibly strong bond and sense of
unity that the team possessed after
having navigated the peaks and val
leys of the season as a cohesive unit.
"Anyone would give the shirt off
his back to another guy," Wilson
said. "We trust each other; everyone
trusts each other completely, every
one's really close. It's definitely just
the way you would feel about a
brother. I mean, you trust your
brother, you die for your brother,
you'd do anything for your brother.
And that's just the way the whole
team is."
