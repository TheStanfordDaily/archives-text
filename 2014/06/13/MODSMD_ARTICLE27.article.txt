"Two! Two! That's two! TWO!
TWOOOO!"
It wasn't just the trio of coach
es who rocketed out of their chairs
as if their seats had suddenly be
come red-hot, screaming at the
tops of their lungs for points to be
awarded while pointing at the two
tangled bodies on the far side of
the black mat. It was also the pair
of athletes standing behind their
coaches at the edge of the mat,
voicing their displeasure to the
referee as they jumped up and
down. And it was also the section
of fans clad in cardinal red that
bounded to its feet in unison,
yelling and gesturing, filling the
vastness of Maples Pavilion with
its collective voice.
The referee stared intently at
the squirming knot of bodies at his
feet, analyzing the placement of
the limbs, the forces being exerted
in all directions and the raw deter
mination of two individuals, each
straining with all his might to over
come the other.
All of a sudden, his right hand
shot up, two fingers pointed sky
ward, extensions of an arm
wrapped with a red sweatband.
Tivo points, red.
The whistle signaling the break
of the tie and the end of the
match was lost in the over
whelming roar that arose from the
small Stanford section of the
bleachers. Although there couldn't
have been more than 200 of them,
the din that they raised was akin to
the pandemonium after a game
winning buzzer-beater or a walk
off home run.
Senior Dan Scherer stood in
the center of the mat with an ex
hausted yet triumphant grin, hand
held high by the referee signaling
his victory one more tally in the
most successful season in team
history and one final conquest in
front of the Stanford faithful.
On Sunday, that roar inside
Maples Pavilion wasn't for a dou
ble alley-oop for Cardinal men's
basketball, nor was it for another
conference title for women's bas
ketball. Instead, it was in recogni
tion of Stanford wrestling a
team largely overlooked and for
gotten that had faded into relative
obscurity on campus â€”because
on Sunday, with the Pac-12 Cham
pionships held on the Farm for the
first time since 2006, the team
capped off a regular season in
which it thundered back to rele
vance, establishing a presence
that looks to be here to stay.

Walking into the wrestling
room in the basement of the Arril
laga Family Sports Center two

days before the Pac-12 Champi
onship, you can feel it in the air. No,
not the hint of stale sweat left over
from tireless weeks of preparation.
You can feel the energy, the buzz
and the camaraderie of the group
of individuals sprawled out on the
dull red mat. Looking around, you
get the sense that the term "group
of individuals" doesn't quite do jus
tice to the young men completely at
ease throwing around playful ban
ter or casually practicing pinning
each other. This is a team, in every
sense of the term.
From the 5-foot-2, 125-pound
Ryan Silver to the 6-foot-1, 285-
pound Josh Marchok, the mem
bers of this team have forged a
bond through their combined suc
cesses and failures in a historic sea
son, one in which they are looking
to capture the first conference title
in school history after breaking the
school record for the most dual
meet wins in a season. For veterans
like fifth-year senior Ryan Mango,
the season has been a testament to
just how much the program has im
proved in such a short period of
time from just eight dual wins
during the 2008-09 season to 17
this season.
"When I first came here, that
was really the emphasis, even
when I was being recruited here,"
Mango said. "[Head coach Jason]
Borrelli emphasized trying to turn
the program around and being in a
program that's respected, and re
ally making that change happen
rather than talking about it. So
throughout the past four or five
years, we've had our ups and
downs and... it's finally paying off
a little bit this year."
Mango is one of the established
leaders of the team. A two-time
All-American and three-time com
petitor at national tournaments, he
is one of the most experienced
wrestlers in the country and will be
looking to claim his second consec
utive Pac-12 title after redshirting
his senior year while moving up
weight classes from 125 pounds to
133. While his 106 career wins
speak for themselves. Even more
so, it's his maturity and persever
ance outside competition that have
been significant to not only the
team, but also to the development
of head coach Jason Borrelli,
whose young coaching career was
profoundly affected by Mango's
actions during the wrestler's time
at Stanford.
"You'd like to think as a coach
that you're doing a lot of teaching
and coaching, but Ryan has actual
ly helped our coaching staff in so
many ways," Borrelli said. "Little
things about persevering through
injuries, and for me as a young
coach who was still trying t0... fig
ure out the mindset of a student
athlete, Ryan is one of the first kids

round, a victory that sent fans at Maples Pavilion into a frenzy.
