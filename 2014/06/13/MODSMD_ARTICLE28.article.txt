# ON TO THE MUSIC CITY
## Stanford makes its 12th Final Four appearance 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR

Country music was blasting, a country twang
was heard in the voices of the players buzzing
with excitement, fried chicken was being
munched on and "NASHVILLE" was printed
across the white board. The locker room was
filled with energy, as the southward-bound
Stanford's women's basketball team celebrated
its regional final victory over North Carolina.
For the 11th time under head coach Tara Van-
Derveer, the Cardinal are headed to the Final
Four of the NCAA Tournament.

The Cardinal's 74-65 victory over the Tar
Heels wasn't a guarantee from the opening tip,
but as Ail-American senior forward Chiney Og
wumike said post-game, it was "heart, heart,
heart" and not "perfectly executed plays" that
earned Stanford the win. Stanford trailed UNC
at the half by six points after the Tar Heels' elec
tric 7-for-13 (53.8%) 3-point shooting to open the
game.
"If a game was like five minutes long, we
would not be sitting up here and be in a good

mood. If the game was even ten minutes long,
we'd probably not be excited," VanDerveer said.
"But in 40 minutes, our team really showed
great resilience, figured out things that were
working, worked really hard together and beat
an excellent UNC team."
After junior point guard Amber Orrange
scored the first basket of the game on Stanford's
opening possession, the Cardinal went cold for
the next five minutes of play, allowing the Tar
Heels to take an early 7-2 lead. UNC knocked
down five consecutive 3-pointers to push the
lead to 22-9 with 12:47 remaining in the first half.
The Tar Heels dominated the Cardinal in the
paint in the opening half of play, limiting Ogwu
mike to just four points. The first half boiled
down to a shooting competition as both teams
scored under 10 points in the paint. Orrange
held up the Cardinal offense in the first half with
12 points, finishing the game with 14 points and
four assists.
"I think our team did a really good job of not
being discouraged," Ogwumike said. "Basket
ball is a game of runs. They had a run in the be
ginning of the game, and we got our run right
before halftime to give us a chance in the second
half."
While freshman guard Lili Thompson was
able to shut down the Tar Heel's freshman sen
sation Diamond DeShields, holding her to just
four points in the first half, it was freshman All
isha Gray who lit it up with 15 points in the first
half, leading the Tar Heels' charge against the
Card.
The second half was all Cardinal for nearly
all 20 minutes. Stanford outscored UNC 44-29 in
the second half, shooting 58.6 percent and hold
ing UNC to just 37.9 percent. Orrange played

stifling defense on Gray and only allowed her
four points, while Thompson continued to con
tain DeShields, allowing her just nine points in
the second half for a total of 13 in the game.
DeShields had been averaging 18.8 points per
game this season.
Stanford made key adjustments at halftime
to get the ball to Ogwumike more effectively.
Ogwumike finished the game with 20 points and
10 rebounds. Her 93 points in this year's NCAA
Tournament ranks second behind Baylor's
Odyssey Sims, and her 167 career rebounds in
the tournament rank tenth in NCAA history.
Redshirt senior Mikaela Ruef provided a
resurgent spark in the second half, rallying the
crowd behind the players, when she knocked
down three 3-pointers. She finished the game
with a career-high 17 points and three assists
that perfectly set Ogwumike up underneath the
basket to score. Her "best game ever putting on
a Stanford uniform," according to VanDerveer,
earned her regional MVP honors. Ruef had only
knocked down six 3-pointers in her career prior
to last night's game.
"[The defense] was literally standing in the
paint, and I was like, well, you know what, I'm ei
ther going to turn it over or this is going to go in,
so I shot it, and it went in. Then I just kept
shooting it," Ruef said.
After going on a 13-4 run to open up the half,
Stanford took its first lead since going up 2-0 to
start the game. The lead changed three times
late in the second half, as UNC did not allow
Stanford to pull away by more than eight points.
UNC was able to gain a 63-62 lead with four min-

Stanford overcame a halftime deficit to defeat UNC and book its ticket to the Final Four. Senior toward Chiney Ogwumike (right), who would

from freshman Jessica Washing

Thompson, who finished the
game with 10 points and two steals,
scored two of the Card's next three
baskets to put Stanford in the lead
for good. Junior guard Bonnie
Samuelson iced the game minutes
later with two free throws to make
it a two-possession game with 21
seconds remaining. Samuelson
scored 13 points in the win and her
14 three-pointers were the most by
any player in the 2014 N CAA Tour
nament.

With Ogwumike, Orrange, Ruef,
Thompson and Samuelson all scor
ing in double digits, the Cardinal
offense looked unstoppable es

pecially in the second half while
the defense opened up great oppor
tunities to score. This was the first
game in more than a year that five
players scored in double digits.
"If we have so many people
[scoring], that's when we play at
our best," Ogwumike said. "When
Amber was doing it in the begin
ning and Mikaela consistently
through the second half, and Lili
coming up with big plays off the
dribble, those are the things that
make us a better team."
While it was the last game at
Maples for seniors Ogwumike, Ruef
and Sara James, the Cardinal's
journey to the Final Four will con
tinue on Thursday when the team
travels to Nashville, Tenn. Stanford
will take on the No. 1, undefeated,
reigning NCAA champs Connecti
cut on Sunday at 6 p.m.

After junior point guard Amber Orrange
scored the first basket of the game on Stanford's
opening possession, the Cardinal went cold for
the next five minutes of play, allowing the Tar
Heels to take an early 7-2 lead. UNC knocked
down five consecutive 3-pointers to push the
lead to 22-9 with 12:47 remaining in the first half.
The Tar Heels dominated the Cardinal in the
paint in the opening half of play, limiting Ogwu

down to a shooting competition as both teams
scored under 10 points in the paint. Orrange

DeShields had been averaging 18.8 points per

Stanford made key adjustments at halftime
to get the ball to Ogwumike more effectively.
Ogwumike finished the game with 20 points and
10 rebounds. Her 93 points in this year's NCAA

the tournament rank tenth in NCAA history.
Redshirt senior Mikaela Ruef provided a
resurgent spark in the second half, rallying the
crowd behind the players, when she knocked
down three 3-pointers. She finished the game
with a career-high 17 points and three assists
that perfectly set Ogwumike up underneath the
basket to score. Her "best game ever putting on
a Stanford uniform," according to VanDerveer,
earned her regional MVP honors. Ruef had only
knocked down six 3-pointers in her career prior
to last night's game.
"[The defense] was literally standing in the

so I shot it, and it went in. Then I just kept

After going on a 13-4 run to open up the half,
Stanford took its first lead since going up 2-0 to
start the game. The lead changed three times

Stanford overcame a halftime deficit to defeat UNC and book its ticket to the Final Four. Senior toward Chiney Ogwumike (right), who would

Thompson, who finished the
game with 10 points and two steals,
scored two of the Card's next three
baskets to put Stanford in the lead
for good. Junior guard Bonnie
Samuelson iced the game minutes
later with two free throws to make
it a two-possession game with 21
seconds remaining. Samuelson
scored 13 points in the win and her
14 three-pointers were the most by
any player in the 2014 N CAA Tour
nament.

With Ogwumike, Orrange, Ruef,
Thompson and Samuelson all scor
ing in double digits, the Cardinal
offense looked unstoppable es

pecially in the second half while
the defense opened up great oppor
tunities to score. This was the first
game in more than a year that five
players scored in double digits.
"If we have so many people
[scoring], that's when we play at
our best," Ogwumike said. "When
Amber was doing it in the begin
ning and Mikaela consistently
through the second half, and Lili
coming up with big plays off the
dribble, those are the things that
make us a better team."
While it was the last game at
Maples for seniors Ogwumike, Ruef
and Sara James, the Cardinal's
journey to the Final Four will con
tinue on Thursday when the team
travels to Nashville, Tenn. Stanford
will take on the No. 1, undefeated,
reigning NCAA champs Connecti

Country music was blasting, a country twang
was heard in the voices of the players buzzing
with excitement, fried chicken was being
munched on and "NASHVILLE" was printed
across the white board. The locker room was
filled with energy, as the southward-bound
Stanford's women's basketball team celebrated
its regional final victory over North Carolina.
For the 11th time under head coach Tara Van-
Derveer, the Cardinal are headed to the Final
Four of the NCAA Tournament.

The Cardinal's 74-65 victory over the Tar
Heels wasn't a guarantee from the opening tip,
but as Ail-American senior forward Chiney Og
wumike said post-game, it was "heart, heart,
heart" and not "perfectly executed plays" that
earned Stanford the win. Stanford trailed UNC
at the half by six points after the Tar Heels' elec
tric 7-for-13 (53.8%) 3-point shooting to open the
game.
"If a game was like five minutes long, we
would not be sitting up here and be in a good

mood. If the game was even ten minutes long,
we'd probably not be excited," VanDerveer said.
"But in 40 minutes, our team really showed
great resilience, figured out things that were
working, worked really hard together and beat
an excellent UNC team."
After junior point guard Amber Orrange
scored the first basket of the game on Stanford's
opening possession, the Cardinal went cold for
the next five minutes of play, allowing the Tar
Heels to take an early 7-2 lead. UNC knocked
down five consecutive 3-pointers to push the
lead to 22-9 with 12:47 remaining in the first half.
The Tar Heels dominated the Cardinal in the
paint in the opening half of play, limiting Ogwu
mike to just four points. The first half boiled
down to a shooting competition as both teams
scored under 10 points in the paint. Orrange
held up the Cardinal offense in the first half with
12 points, finishing the game with 14 points and
four assists.
"I think our team did a really good job of not
being discouraged," Ogwumike said. "Basket
ball is a game of runs. They had a run in the be
ginning of the game, and we got our run right
before halftime to give us a chance in the second
half."
While freshman guard Lili Thompson was
able to shut down the Tar Heel's freshman sen
sation Diamond DeShields, holding her to just
four points in the first half, it was freshman All
isha Gray who lit it up with 15 points in the first
half, leading the Tar Heels' charge against the
Card.
The second half was all Cardinal for nearly
all 20 minutes. Stanford outscored UNC 44-29 in
the second half, shooting 58.6 percent and hold
ing UNC to just 37.9 percent. Orrange played

stifling defense on Gray and only allowed her
four points, while Thompson continued to con
tain DeShields, allowing her just nine points in
the second half for a total of 13 in the game.
DeShields had been averaging 18.8 points per
game this season.
Stanford made key adjustments at halftime
to get the ball to Ogwumike more effectively.
Ogwumike finished the game with 20 points and
10 rebounds. Her 93 points in this year's NCAA
Tournament ranks second behind Baylor's
Odyssey Sims, and her 167 career rebounds in
the tournament rank tenth in NCAA history.
Redshirt senior Mikaela Ruef provided a
resurgent spark in the second half, rallying the
crowd behind the players, when she knocked
down three 3-pointers. She finished the game
with a career-high 17 points and three assists
that perfectly set Ogwumike up underneath the
basket to score. Her "best game ever putting on
a Stanford uniform," according to VanDerveer,
earned her regional MVP honors. Ruef had only
knocked down six 3-pointers in her career prior
to last night's game.
"[The defense] was literally standing in the
paint, and I was like, well, you know what, I'm ei
ther going to turn it over or this is going to go in,
so I shot it, and it went in. Then I just kept
shooting it," Ruef said.
After going on a 13-4 run to open up the half,
Stanford took its first lead since going up 2-0 to
start the game. The lead changed three times
late in the second half, as UNC did not allow
Stanford to pull away by more than eight points.
