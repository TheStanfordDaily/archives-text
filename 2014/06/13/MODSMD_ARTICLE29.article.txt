Chad La Tburette is five
laps away from making
the Olympics. It's the
1,500-meter freestyle
finals on the last day
of the 2012 U.S. Olympic Trials in
Omaha, Neb., where the nation's
top 2,000 swimmers have gathered
to compete for just a handful of
spots on the U.S. Olympic team.
A recent Stanford graduate,
La Tourette has logged lap after
lap usually at the rate of 16,000
meters per day to prepare for
the most important race of his life.
Stanford is a factory where
Olympians are mass-produced
every four years: Cardinal-affili
ated athletes have collected a total
of 224 medals in Olympic history,
and if Stanford were its own coun
try, it would be ranked 24th in the
all-time Olympic medal standings,
ahead of Spain, Greece and Mexi-

Co.
Failure is rarely associated
with Stanford athletics.
Four years earlier at the 2008
Trials, La Tourette finished third
in the same event in the same pool.
At almost every other meet, a
swimmer is given a bronze medal
if he finishes third, but because
only the top two finishers in each
event qualify for the Olympics,
coming in third at the Trials is a
swimmer's worst nightmare.
It was a setback for La
Tourette at first, but since then he
has won six medals at major inter
national competitions, broken an
American record and claimed an
NCAA title and two runner-up fin
ishes. He came into the Trials as
the owner of the nation's fastest
time in the 30-lap race.
His journey to the 2012 Trials
should serve as a tale of redemp
tion, a tale of a veteran swimmer
finally fulfilling his ultimate
dream after coming tantalizingly
short four years ago. Stanford is a
breeding ground for Olympic suc

cess, and there is no reason to
think that La Tourette won't join
the hundreds of Stanford
Olympians who have come before
him.
But he won't. La Tourette has
led the field for the first 12 min
utes of the race, but in the next
three, his dream turns into a
nightmare the very same one
he lived in 2008.
La Tourette climbs out of the
pool, a third-place finisher once
again. The first person he finds is
Bill Rose, his coach.
"It was the worst thing that's
ever happened to me in my 45
years of coaching," Rose will later
remember. La Tourette will have
trouble forgetting, too.
For now, all he does is stare at
his coach.

Unlike most record-setting ath
letes, La Tourette wasn't born with
great physical talent.
He first stalled swimming as an
8-year-old when he joined the Mis
sion Viejo Nadadores, one of the

largest and most acclaimed swim
ming clubs in the country. But La
Tourette didn't post eye-popping
times early on as an age-group
swimmer. Nor was there any other
indication that he would become
one of the best swimmers to ever
come out of Mission Viejo, the only
club team that he trained with until
2012.
It wasn't until La Tourette was
13 years old that he caught the at
tention of Rose, the longtime head
coach of Mission Viejo and a mem
ber of the American Swim Coaches
Hall of Fame. Rose was impressed
by La Tourette's attitude and ap
proach to his races at a local sum
mer meet, and six months later, La
Tourette began training with the
group of swimmers directly
coached by Rose, an honor re
served for the top swimmers at
Mission Viejo.
"Chad was a late bloomer," Rose
said. "Through his age group, he
was just kind of a normal swimmer,
