discusses sexual assault.
"Five months ago, I was
forcibly raped by another Stan
ford student."
So began an email by Leah
Francis 'l4 that quickly circulated
throughout the Stanford commu
nity Tuesday night. In the email,
Francis disclosed the story of her
sexual assault and the ensuing ju
dicial process, and called for re
forms to the University's handling
of sexual assault cases.
According to documents ob
tained by The Daily, the Universi
ty's Alternate Review Process
(ARP) found Francis' rapist re
sponsible for sexual assault, sexu

al misconduct and violating the
Fundamental Standard. His pun
ishment was a five-quarter sus
pension, 40 hours of community
service and completion of a sexual
assault awareness program.
However, the suspension does
not take effect until summer 2014
and includes summer quarters, so
Francis' assailant, a member of the
Class of 2014, can graduate on
time and return in a year for grad
uate school. According to Francis,
he was originally going to be al
lowed to walk at Commencement
until Francis raised a complaint to
Stanford's Title IX coordinator.
In her email, Francis charac
terized this punishment as a "gap
year."
"Should he change his mind
and decide to go to grad school
elsewhere, he can choose to walk
away from Stanford with no signif-

Last Thursday at White Plaza, sexual assault victim Leah Francis '14
rallied for the reformation of sexual violence resources and
policies at Stanford, gathering the support of hundreds of students.
icant undergraduate consequences for
forcibly sexually assaulting me," she
wrote.
Criticisms of ARP
In May 2013, Stanford adopted a re
vised Alternate Review Process follow
ing two years of review in response to the
Dear Colleague Letter sent by the De
partment of Education in April 2011. The
new standard lowered the standard of
proof from "beyond a reasonable doubt"
to "a preponderance of the evidence" and
made several changes to the process of
reviewing sexual assault cases.
In an interview with The Daily, Fran
cis was critical of the current process of
adjudicating sexual assault cases.
"It really ruins your life. It's really
hard to maintain any semblance of ac
ceptable grades [while going through the
ARP]," Francis said, adding that she esti
mated that she had to write over 100
pages for the proceedings. "[The process
is] extremely detrimental to the ability of
the survivor to keep on surviving."
Francis reported the assault, which
took place off campus early in the morn
ing of Jan. 1, 2014, to the University on
Jan. 7. According to documents obtained
by The Daily, the assailant was notified
that he was being formally charged on
April 9. He was found guilty on April 25,
and sanctions were announced on May 6.
In accordance with Title IX, schools
must complete their investigations into
sexual assault cases in a "reasonably
prompt" time frame. According to the
Department of Education, a typical in
vestigation takes approximately 60 days,
although compliance is determined on a
case-by-case basis.
On June 2, Francis filed an appeal
against the sanctions and requested that
her assailant be expelled. The University
has not yet ruled on the appeal.
Before filing her appeal, Francis re
quested further justification for the
panel's original sanctions. In additional
information released on May 13, the
panel explained its initial decision by stat
ing, "[Francis' assailant] demonstrated a
commitment and ability to abide by Uni
versity policy moving forward. The panel
felt that his presence on campus will not
constitute a threat to the Stanford com
munity, and that expulsion is therefore
unwarranted."
According to Francis, the panelists
were given a document containing Stan
ford's precedent of sanctions for sexual
assault cases to assist them in their deci
sion-making. This document, which The
Daily has obtained, indicates that the
University has suspended nine students
(for between one and eight quarters) and
expelled one for sexual assault since 2005.
Until Francis' case, no student had been
sanctioned for sexual assault since the
2010-11 school year.
Changes Demanded
Francis will be leading a "Rally for
Reforming Sexual Violence Resources
and Policy at Stanford" today in White
Plaza. Students have been putting flyers
around campus and are also planning to
wear red tape on then* caps at Com
mencement as a sign of protest. An online
petition in favor of reform had over 800
signatures as of Wednesday night.
The protesters are demanding
changes including mandatory expulsion
for individuals found guilty of sexual as
sault, expanded resources for preventing
sexual assault and better support for sur
vivors of sexual assault.
According to Francis, her assailant
can currently attend classes at Stanford
but has to be escorted by a plainclothes
officer at all times.
"Rather than providing a cushion
around a person who has been convicted
of a violent sex crime [to keep them away
from the victim]... [Stanford] should be
severing ties with that person," Francis
said.
Rebecca Felix 'l4, another student in
volved in the campaign for Stanford to
change its policies, said that the office of

Sexual Assault and Relationship Abuse
(SARA) needs to expand its resources.
Felix said that some survivors of sexual
assault had contacted her and told her
that when they visited the SARA office
during drop-in hours, no one was there.
Francis said that she had visited the office
herself and found no one there.
Another reform that Francis would
like is to assign each survivor of sexual as
sault a volunteer professor who can act as
a resource and advisor. Francis said that
when a tenured professor became in
volved in her case, the University became
much more responsive to her needs. Ac
cording to Francis, her assailant had con
tinued to live near her residence for two
weeks after the sanctions were returned
against him, but was moved out of his
housing the day she contacted a tenured
professor.
Francis also called for secrecy rules to
be relaxed during ARP proceedings.
"I felt like the University was trying
to prevent me from getting the help that
I needed," Francis said.
University Response
In an email to The Daily, University
spokesperson Lisa Lapin wrote that the
University cannot comment on specific
cases, but "we regret any circumstance in
which a student believes a process here at
Stanford has not met their expectations."
"We take very seriously the pain and
trauma that are generated by sexual as
sault," Lapin wrote. "We have strength
ened our programs in the area of sexual
assault response and prevention over the
last several years, seeking to provide
support to individuals in crisis, encourage
reporting, ensure fair and thorough disci
plinary processes, and educate the com
munity to prevent future incidents. But
we are always looking to improve what
we do, and we genuinely welcome input
from students on how we can do better."
In an interview, Lapin added that it
would be premature to speculate about
any additional reforms at this point.
The effort to change Stanford's policy
towards sexual assault comes at a time
when sexual assault policies are being ex
amined at colleges and universities
across the country. On May 1, the Depart
ment of Education's Office for Civil
Rights released a list of 55 colleges under
investigation for possible Title IX viola
tions related to the handling of sexual as
sault cases. Stanford was not on this list.
The University recently hired a new
Title IX Coordinator, Catherine Criswell.
Criswell also refused to comment on a
pending case, but wrote in an email to
The Daily that she has "already begun ac
tive conversations with students, faculty
and staff around these issues."
On Wednesday, the University
provost posted a new website that listed
resources for sexual assault survivors.
The website explains that survivors have
several options and recommends that
survivors report their experience to the
police and the University.
In the Facebook event for the rally,
one student wrote that the website mere
ly reiterates Stanford's current policy.
The post invited others to attend the
protest and "let our university know that
we are NOT looking for a new website,
we are looking to change policies and the
culture around sexual assault and abuse
at [Stanford.]"
"We wanted to focus on changing
campus culture, university policy and
getting more resources for survivors of
sexual assault, and we believe that having
a rally in support of those objectives is the
most productive thing we can do," Fran
cis said. "What we really care about is
helping other survivors."
