Aubui'n 34, Alabama 28.
Auburn is the Big Bang
and it has created
something we have
never seen.
"Outlined against a blue, gray Oc
tober sky the Four Horsemen rode
again," wrote Grantland Rice about
Notre Dame, and the names
Stuhldreher, Miller, Crowley and Lay
den passed into eternity. "He sent his
sacrificial lambs out to slaughter the
butcher," wrote John Underwood
about Miami, and so carved Howard
Schnellenberger into living marble.
This game deserves a better epitaph
than the one I will give it. It calls for
some grand pronouncement of an al
most sacrilegious flair.
But it is the box score of the game
that is truly heretical in its ignorance
of the moment. Fourth quarter, tie
game, one second left on the clock,
Chris Daihs, 109-yard field, goal
return for a touchdown. Auburn
3f Alabama 28. The score doesn't
do this game justice. It never tried,
and it never will.
Stanford beat Notre Dame, but
all we can talk about is the SEC and
its raucous finale of Auburn-Ala
bama. And for once, I have no prob
lem with that.
Even as a West Coast man, I can
not tear my eyes away from the
Southland drama that exploded into
being on Saturday night. It was the
single most unlikely play in football
unfolding at the absolute perfect
moment. It remains wondrous and
unknowable, some quantum shiver
in nature slowly solidifying in our
minds.
As I write, the eyes of a thousand
sportswriters still flicker desper
ately across the ghostly pages of
history, searching for some apt com
parison or even just something to
describe what happened even
just words.
Now, more than ever, there are
no words.
Auburn reminds us that the lim
itations of language are nothing
new. "Words are but the vague
shadows of the volumes we mean,"
an old teacher once told me. He was
correct. And though we understand
that sports is ultimately irrelevant
to the active work of life, Saturday's
game is like any moment of true,
visceral significance; we revisit it
again and again because each time
we try to express it we come up
short.
This game will never leave us, if
only because we will never under
stand it. History was made on Sat
urday night, and all history is sim
ply conjecture of various degrees.
No matter what he says in the
decades to come, we won't under
stand why Nick Saban ordered Ala
bama to attempt a delusional 57-
yard field goal. We won't under
stand why Stanford Stadium, of all
places, erupted in cheers as Davis'
run for the ages unfolded on the
screen. We won't ever truly under
stand why a single football game
meant so much to Auburn, or to any
body else. The answer is different
for everyone, even if the outcome is
the same.
We do know, however, that we ap
preciate the dramatic.
Put aside the fact that last sea
son Auburn finished 3-9 and lost to
Alabama by seven touchdowns.
After winning three national cham
pionships in four years, Alabama
was invincible.
People talk about how losses to
Stanford and Arizona shattered
Oregon's aura of invincibility. The
shadow of Alabama was infinitely
more terrifying than that. Oregon
merely ran up the score. Alabama
was perpetual motion in the guise of
a football team, an endlessly reload
ing death machine that strangled
teams day in and day out.
Nick Saban called his achieve
ment a "process," and it seemed as
though all of college football was
being processed through the
world's most soul-crushing meat
grinder. Every time Alabama lost a
game, it was as if the world had
turned upside down and decided to
spin the other way for good meas
ure.
The feeling still persists. Ala
bama is not gone. Saban is still one
of the greatest coaches of all time.
The Crimson Tide is still loaded
with NFL talent across its entire
roster. But that only magnifies
Auburn's glory.
On the biggest stage in the
South, with the finest team of the
decade coming to town, every leg
endary play was accompanied by an
equally legendary moment. Even if
we consider how well Auburn
played on Saturday night, we're
never going to divorce it from its
