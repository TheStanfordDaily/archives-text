There are some storylines in
which, despite their best efforts, the
good guys just don't win. Game of
Thrones, The Usual Suspects
and the Coen brothers' No Coun
try for Old Men are striking ex
amples of antagonists swooping in
unexpectedly to seize victory. If you
like that type of narrative, the
stroke play portion of the 2014
NCAA Men's Golf Championships
was not your kind of drama. Be
cause in that story, Stanford's
Cameron Wilson first took the indi
vidual medalist honors, and then
promptly proceeded to talk about
his teammates â€”in classic good
guy fashion.
"It's incredible, so glad I made
that putt, this is surreal," Wilson
said immediately after his win on
the third playoff hole against Geor
gia Tech's Ollie Schniederjans. "I've
got to mention my team first. I've
got to say how proud I am of my
guys so far. There is a lot of golf left,
but I am really happy for all of the
guys."

The usually calm and stoic senior
showed just the slightest bit of emo

tion after his final birdie putt hit the
bottom of the hole, hugging his
teammates and his coaches as they
met him on the 17th green to cele
brate the program's first individual
national title since Tiger Woods in
Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1996.
Those embraces and handshakes
released the tension that was clear
ly visible in everyone but the man
walking the course.
The drama began back in regula
tion, when Schniederjans birdied
the 17th hole, moving him into a tie
for the lead with Wilson. Schnieder
jans, however, was playing several
groups in front of Wilson, and en
tered the clubhouse at 6-under for
the tournament with Wilson still on
the course. Stanford's lone senior in
its lineup in Kansas, Wilson sur
passed the Georgia Tech junior by
virtue of his own birdie on 17, lower
ing his score to 7-under with one
hole to play. But his initial iron shot
on the 18th went slightly left into
the rough, and his approach caught
the wispy fescue before rolling into
the greenside bunker. After his chip
shot went begging, Wilson's par
putt snuck just right of the cup, and
he tapped in for bogey to force a
playoff.
"I was disappointed, sure, but I
hit a couple shots that I liked on the
last hole," Wilson said of his final

regulation hole. "The tee shot I hit
almost exactly how I wanted to. Did
n't hit it that much further left than
I was hoping to. And the second shot
I did what I meant to, and the rough
caught my club. I really didn't stray
from my plan that much, and I did
n't beat myself up."
Not that there was much chance
to. After confirmation that it would
be just Schniederjans and Wilson in
the playoff, the two Ben Hogan
Award finalists quickly strode back
to the tee box on 18, where the sud
den death frame began. This time,
Wilson's iron shot found the sloping
fairway, while Schniederjans' swing
found the deep rough on the left side
of the fairway. But he was not able to
capitalize on the birdie putt that en
sued, and both men parred the hole
and moved on to the par-3,185-yard
10th.
Wilson had played the hole even
during the three regulation rounds,
with Schniederjans posting a trio of
birdies on the course's shortest
hole. If there was any time for
Schniederjans to take advantage, it
was then and, given his first shot,
it seemed like he would. Schnieder
jans landed his tee shot within 10
feet of the cup, while Wilson was
about twice as far out. Wilson left
his subsequent putt a few feet short,
but Schniederjans also missed his

opportunity at the win, pushing his
putt a fraction left. All the while,
Wilson appeared unfazed and
moved from shot to shot with his
usual steely focus and precision.
"The emotional strength that he
has and his mental strength, he
doesn't go through highs and lows,"
said commentator Billy Ray Brown
of Wilson. "He possesses a lot of
power off the tee, but more impor
tantly to me, I see him playing a lot
of half shots and keeping the flight
down. And the imagination he has
around the greens. He has got great
touch and I think he has a bright fu
ture ahead of him."
That bright future was cement
ed on the third and final playoff hole,
which took place where much of the
action on Monday occurred: the par
-5,523-yard 17th. After going for the
green in two during regulation, Wil
son took a more conservative ap
proach in the playoff, sending his
drive down the middle, with the ball
sloping slightly to the right into the
thin rough. Schniederjans followed
with an errant tee shot that missed
wide left.
After his opponent stroked his
ball back into the fairway, Wilson
stayed safe and fired an iron shot
just short of the green. By the time

Senior Cameron Wilson (above) was unable to clinch his NCAA individual title in regulation, as he recorded a bogey on the 18th hole in the final
round to force a tiebreak. However, on the third tiebreak hole, he punched in a birdie to win the trophy over Ollie Schniederjans of Georgia Tech.
