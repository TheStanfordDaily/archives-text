## Stanford divests from coal mining companies

The Stanford University Board of
Trustees announced earlier today
that the University will no longer di
rectly invest endowment funds in coal
mining companies, making Stanford
the first maj or American university to
take such a step.
The Board's decision reflects an
endorsement of the Advisory Panel
on Investment Responsibility and Li
censing (APIRL)'s position that di
vesting from coal extraction compa
nies is consistent with the obligations
outlined in Stanford's Statement on
Investment Responsibility.
While that statement identifies
the primary obligation of the trustees
in managing the endowment as maxi
mizing financial returns, it also states
that if trustees judge that "corpo
rate policies or practices create sub
stantial social injury" they can
weigh that factor in making invest
ment decisions.
"Stanford has a responsibility as a
global citizen to promote sustainabili
ty for our planet," said President
John Hennessy in a statement accom
panying the announcement. "The uni
versity's review has concluded that
coal is one of the most carbon-inten
sive methods of energy generation
and that other sources can be readily
substituted for it. Moving away from
coal in the investment context is a
small, but constructive, step while
work continues, at Stanford and else
where, to develop broadly viable sus
tainable energy solutions for the fu
ture."
As of August 2013, Stanford's in
vestment has a value of approximate
ly $18.7 billion. While Stanford does
not disclose specific investments or
their value, the resolution stipulates
that the University stop directly in
vesting in approximately 100 publicly
traded companies that focus on coal
extraction and that it divest of any
current holdings in those firms.
In addition to divesting any direct
investments, Stanford is also recom
mending that its external investment
managers, who invest in wide ranges
of securities on behalf of the Universi
ty, avoid investments in coal mining
companies.
According to University
spokesperson Lisa Lapin, Stanford
will begin the divestment process im
mediately.
Fossil Free Stanford
The decision to divest follows an
organized campaign by the student
group Fossil Free Stanford. Last
year, the group petitioned the Univer
sity to divest from over 200 fossil-fuel
extraction companies and it has
worked with the APIRL since to make
the case that investing in fossil fuel
companies is socially irresponsible.
According to Board Chair Steven
Denning MBA '7B, Fossil Free Stan
ford "catalyzed an important discus
sion" about the University's invest
ments.

"We believe this action provides
leadership on a critical matter facing
our world and is an appropriate appli
cation of the University's investment
responsibility policy," Denning told
the Stanford News Service.

According to Lapin, the APIRL
made the recommendation to divest
from coal mining companies last
month. The Board of Trustees' vote
was conducted by telephone yester
day.
Members of Fossil Free Stanford
said that they hadn't expected the
Board to make a decision before its
June meeting. However, University
officials notified the group late last
week that a decision was imminent
and administrators personally noti
fied the group members of the deci
sion just prior to the public announce
ment yesterday afternoon.
Building a coalition
Earlier this year, the student body
passed a resolution sponsored by Fos
sil Free Stanford supporting divest
ment from fossil fuels, with the meas
ure garnering 78 percent of votes in
favor.
"The referendum was generally
symbolic but it showed that students
were united about something in away
that they don't usually get united,"
said Michael Penuelas 'l5, a student
organizer of Fossil Free Stanford. "It
was really powerful because it took
student voices and magnified them to
the institutional level."
The same week the resolution
passed, Fossil Free Stanford deliv
ered over 200 letters from alumni to
Hennessy's office.
Yari Greaney 'l5, another student
organizer of Fossil Free Stanford, em
phasized the group's efforts to create
a coalition of students, faculty and
alumni against investment in fossil
fuels.
"We really appreciate that Stan
ford does have these channels open to
us," Greaney said. "We can communi
cate our concerns to the advisory
panel and we can move our concerns
along to the Board of Trustees. We're
glad that that's an opportunity that's
open to us and we are happy to take
advantage of that."
A major step
While the student body's support
for a resolution backing divestment
from fossil fuels followed the example
of student bodies at several peer insti
tutions, the University's decision to
officially divest made Stanford the
first major American university to do
so.
In the past week, meanwhile, stu
dents at Harvard and Washington
University in Saint Louis were ar
rested for protesting in favor of di
vestment. Administrators at other
schools such as Yale and Brown have
also thus far rejected divestment,
even after their student bodies
passed referendums in support of the
action.
Members of Fossil Free Stanford
expressed hope that Stanford's deci
sion will stimulate broader action.
Greaney said her group doesn't just
see this as a first step in the divest
ment process but as a major step in
the climate movement.
"We want to really celebrate this
and put it in a bigger context than just
a divestment campaign, because di
vestment is a strategy and fighting
climate change is what we are work
ing toward," Greaney said.
Greaney added that Fossil Fuel
Stanford's central goal remains di-

vestment from all fossil fuels.
"The entire fossil fuel in
dustry is predicated on a busi
ness model that is incompati
ble with the climate and we
will continue to ask that our
administrators don't fund an
industry that pollutes our
world," Greaney said. "The
Board seems open to further
divestment so we're excited to
use this as a really strong and
very powerful starting place."
