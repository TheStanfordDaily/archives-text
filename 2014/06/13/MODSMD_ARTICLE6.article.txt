## Ike's Place to leave after June 15 Students distrust process leading to Ike's departure

Four years after establishing it
self as a campus landmark, Ike's
Place is leaving.
Last Friday, students gathered
in White Plaza for a "Save Ike's"
rally, handing out over 200 Ike's
sandwiches in less than 15 minutes.
The demonstration followed the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate's
unanimous resolution in support of
Ike's Place on May 6.
The protests and ASSU resolu
tion come on the heels of Ike's
drawn-out departure from the
Forbes Family Cafe in the Jen-Hsun
Huang Engineering Center in the
Science and Engineering Quad,
where owner Ike Shehadeh had
opened with much fanfare in 2009.
Ike's Place will remain open until
June 15, but in the meantime, a
group of more than 50 students call
ing themselves "Ike's Army" have
distributed fliers across campus de
manding that the bustling sandwich
shop return next year.
On April 25, the University an
nounced that Ike's Place will be re
placed by an eatery operated by
Stanford Residential and Dining
Enterprises (R&DE) in September.
R&DE has not yet announced the
details of its winning restaurant con
cept. In the meantime, students
have been left to wonder how the de
cision to award the contract was
made, who made it and why.
Ultimately, the decision was
made by the Forbes Family Cafe
Request for Proposal (RFP) Com
mittee a group of six staff mem
bers, no faculty, one graduate stu
dent and one undergraduate stu
dent operating in close coordination
with Lindsey Akin, services manag
er for the Science and Engineering
Quad. University officials have re
fused to release the names of any
committee members, claiming that
they are confidential.
The use of confidential commit
tees for RFPs is standard practice.
In February 2009, such a committee
was responsible for finding the
Forbes Family Cafe's first tenant,
contacting 13 vendors before unani
mously awarding Shehadeh the con
tract from 2010 to 2013, with an op
tion to extend for another three
years afterwards.
In September 2012, when She
hadeh stepped back from manage
ment of the Stanford location, Stan
ford exercised a limited option to ex
tend the Ike's Place lease for one
more year, until June 2014.
This particular process is not
under scrutiny because of wrongdo

ing by any department certainly
not by R&DE, whose role in this
process is peripheral. It is under
scrutiny because of how the RFPs,
faithfully administered by adminis
trators and officials according to
University guidelines and in good
faith, could reach such universally
unpopular decisions.
Requests for a new proposal
In October 2013, just as Ike's
was beginning its last academic year
of operations in Huang, the Stan
ford Purchasing and Contracts of
fice opened the Forbes Family Cafe
case for bidding. The next month,

Akin, the point person for the con
tract, disseminated a food services
survey that would be used as part of
the RFP Committee's evaluation
criteria. The Committee then chose
16 local businesses to invite for a
tour of the Forbes Family Cafe.
On Dec. 17, 2013, representa
tives from the invited vendors at
tended a "bid walk" at the Huang
Engineering Center. Several ven
dors, including big-name chains like
Chipotle and Pizza My Heart, were
unable to seriously consider a bid
because of the Forbes Family Cafe's

limited kitchen space.
Only three vendors Coupa
Cafe, Ike's Place and R&DE
made formal bid presentations dur
ing the week of Feb. 24.
"The majority [of potential ven
dors] saw how small the space was
and said, 'We're not interested,"' said
Troy Sutton, the contracts manager
at the Stanford purchasing depart
ment. "People walked away. They
participated, but they weren't inter
ested in submitting a proposal."
So by March, when the Commit
tee met to deliberate the awarding of
the lease, comparing the three op
tions.
According to a partial list of crite
ria obtained by The Daily, committee
members were asked to rate each
vendor's bid on the following factors:
variety of menu, seasonality, pricing,
sustainability, staff benefits and
turnover, wait times, company repu
tation and prior experience.
Akin said that content for the bid
presentations was confidential. But
she claimed that R&DE's bid was the
only one that not only addressed each
of these criteria but also went "above
and beyond." According to Akin,
R&DE was the only vendor with the
foresight to delineate changes to their
employee benefits because of the Af
fordable Care Act, for example.
"R&DE proposed a seasonal, af
fordable menu built around sustain
able and local food," Akin said. "Their
proposal was all about sourcing local
ly with everything they serve."

Questioning the survey
Part of the bid process was the
survey disseminated by Akin to vari
ous science and engineering-related
e-mail lists in November 2013, called
"Food in the SEQ." The survey was
intended to gauge community opin
ion on food options and serve as the
foundation for evaluation criteria
during the RFP process; a press re
lease announcing R&DE's successful
bid on April 25 prominently featured
the survey results.
However, the survey has been

widely criticized by students as being
biased against Ike's, and many of the
survey's 900 respondents are now
upset because their responses are
being cited to justify Ike's' depar
ture.
Most of the survey respondents
interviewed by The Daily said that
their response should have indicated
support for Ike's to continue operat
ing.
"If I had known it was a choice be
tween Ike's and anything else, I
would have made it very clear that I
wanted Ike's," said lan Holmes 'l5, a
survey respondent. "The survey was
so deceiving, it should be invalidated."
"I would describe the survey as
designed to answer a question other
than the one it was used to answer,"
said Emily Grubert 'O9, a doctoral
student in Earth Sciences. "My per
ception ... was that the specific ques
tions seemed to focus on particular
elements that Ike's was certain to
score poorly on."
The six-question survey asked re
spondents about desired price range,
wait time and selection for a food ven
dor at the Forbes Family Cafe.
Multiple respondents identified
one specific question that they felt
was biased against Ike's: "What do
you think is a reasonable and realistic
amount of time to wait, starting with
getting in line up until the food is
ready and 'in your hand?"'
Akin and Jamie Beckett, director
of communications and alumni rela
tions at the Stanford School of Engi
neering, have repeatedly cited long
wait times as a complaint about Ike's
despite the restaurant's efforts to im
prove speed of service, like imple
menting an order-ahead/grab-and
go system.
Two students also complained
that language at the top of the survey
suggested that the RFP was a legal
ly mandated formality and misled
them to believe that Ike's was in no
real danger.
"For legal reasons, we have to in
vite several businesses, not just Ike's,
to bid," the survey read.
Allegations that the survey was
an inaccurate representation of stu
dent opinion spread across major
campus e-mail lists on April 28 and
29. A new survey, fielded by Andrew
Aude 'l6, asked respondents

whether they would prefer Ike's or
R&DE to operate in the SEQ (Sci
ence and Engineering Quad) next
year.
In this survey, more than 97 per
cent of respondents in a sample al
most four times the size of the RFP
Committee's indicated that they
would like Ike's to continue operating
next year.
Beckett maintained that the risk
of Ike's Place losing its lease was al
ways implicit in the RFP Commit
tee's survey.
"I don't understand how that
could not be understood [by respon
dents]," she said. "If a contract is
coming up, which the survey says,
then there is always a chance that the
business could lose it."
Sutton, responsible for ensuring
Stanford's RFP processes occur
legally and transparently, stressed
the importance of defining the goal of
the survey process.
"Depending on how you phrase
the question, you're going to make
people look happy or unhappy," he
said.
Akin, who was responsible for
creating, disseminating and analyz
ing the survey, declined to acknowl
edge any problems with the survey's
design or how its recommendations
were used in the RFP Committee's
deliberations.
"Given that it went out to the
whole SEQ population and we got so
many results back, I can only assume
it was valid," she said.
Why Ike's is really leaving
Much has been made of the confi
dential identities of the RFP Com
mittee and problems with its commu
nity opinion survey, but the reality is
that the Committee had little choice
in the matter of who would be award
ed the Forbes Family Cafe contract.
Because of Ike's Place's past
"business" issues in dealing with the
University, they were not a competi
tive bidder in the Committee's delib
erations. These issues also played a
role in the School of Engineering's
decision to only partially exercise an
option to keep Ike's Place operating
past June.
The decision that set off the multi
office RFP process was made in Sep
tember 2012, when officials from the

School of Engineering and the SEQ
decided to option the Forbes Family
Cafe lease for one out of the three
possible years.
According to Akin, the decision to
extend for only a year was based on
"various persistent issues," citing a
range of past problems including
long lines, loud music and alleged
"vulgarities" used by Ike's employ
ees at work.
None of the officials contacted for
this article could comment on the
specifics of these "business" or "facil
ities" issues.
When asked how loud music or
casually dressed employees were
grounds to replace a business on
campus, Akin replied, "We have
deans and donors eating here."
These "persistent issues" likely
played a significant part in the deci
sion to award the Forbes Family Cafe
contract to a vendor other than Ike's.
As SEQ services manager, Akin
briefed the RFP Committee on the
University's dealings with Ike's since
2009, and according to Sutton, the bid
process included specific questions
posed to each vendor that addressed
client needs and concerns.
"Something we generally try to
do with all RFPs is wrap all the spe
cific issues into questions for all ven
dors," he said. "So if we have a ques
tion about A, we will ask 'How will
you deal with it going forward?'
'What is your proposal to deal with
B ?.»
Ike Shehadeh, the owner of Ike's
Place, acknowledges the Universi
ty's right to award the Forbes Fami
ly Cafe lease to another vendor. How
ever, he expressed disappointment
with the problems that the Universi
ty cited to justify ending the lease.
"My understanding of all the is
sues were that they were little is
sues," he said. "As far as I know, they
were unhappy with what we were
doing, pretty much from the first day
that we got there. If we were Star
bucks, they wouldn't kick Starbucks
out over this."
A lesson from Ike's
The opacity of the RFP process
has amplified the uncertainty and
misinformation surrounding Ike's'
departure. It remains true that the
only people who know the content of

the relevant bids are the eight confi
dential committee members and the
administrators who have worked on
the lease.
Additionally, despite repeated in
quiries, officials at multiple Universi
ty departments have rebuffed at
tempts to view the contents of the
bids, the supplementary materials
provided to the Committee to help
evaluate the candidate vendors and
the full list of evaluation criteria.
Despite the fact that no student
consultative mechanism was re
quired to inform the committee, Akin
determined that fielding a survey
was in the best interests of the com
munity. However, the poor survey de
sign has opened up the RFP process
to accusations of pro-R&DE bias. No
evidence exists to substantiate that
charge, but obvious deficiencies in
survey methodology and analysis
like the refusal to disseminate the
raw data and administrators' disin
terest in finding the survey response
rate are at best inept and at worst
dishonest.
Finally, the RFP process at Stan
ford remains opaque and unrepre
sentative. In an open letter to Uni
versity President John Hennessy,
ASSU Senator John-Lancaster Fin
ley 'l6 argued that the RFP Commit
tee and its decisions were unconstitu
tional according to Article I, Section
5.A of the ASSU Constitution, which
stipulates that only the ASSU can
designate students to represent the
student body.
"[Hennessy's] response to me
was that although he was sympathet
ic to the issue I raised, the University
is not bound by the constitution or its
agreement to students," Finley said.
"He told me to talk to his legal coun
sel."
Akin also acknowledged the im
portance of gathering community
opinion despite the fact that it was
not necessitated by any policy or
rale.
"It's going to be a good idea to get
student opinion," she said of her pri
orities in organizing the Forbes Fam
ily Cafe RFP "If Ike's just left, and no
one was consulted, there would be a
revolt."
