## Ike's Place to leave after June 15 Students distrust process leading to Ike's departure

Four years after establishing it
self as a campus landmark, Ike's
Place is leaving.
Last Friday, students gathered
in White Plaza for a "Save Ike's"
rally, handing out over 200 Ike's
sandwiches in less than 15 minutes.
The demonstration followed the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate's
unanimous resolution in support of
Ike's Place on May 6.
The protests and ASSU resolu
tion come on the heels of Ike's
drawn-out departure from the
Forbes Family Cafe in the Jen-Hsun
Huang Engineering Center in the
Science and Engineering Quad,
where owner Ike Shehadeh had
opened with much fanfare in 2009.
Ike's Place will remain open until
June 15, but in the meantime, a
group of more than 50 students call
ing themselves "Ike's Army" have
distributed fliers across campus de
manding that the bustling sandwich
shop return next year.
On April 25, the University an
nounced that Ike's Place will be re
placed by an eatery operated by
Stanford Residential and Dining
Enterprises (R&DE) in September.
R&DE has not yet announced the
details of its winning restaurant con
cept. In the meantime, students
have been left to wonder how the de
cision to award the contract was
made, who made it and why.
Ultimately, the decision was
made by the Forbes Family Cafe
Request for Proposal (RFP) Com
mittee a group of six staff mem
bers, no faculty, one graduate stu
dent and one undergraduate stu
dent operating in close coordination
with Lindsey Akin, services manag
er for the Science and Engineering
Quad. University officials have re
fused to release the names of any
committee members, claiming that
they are confidential.
The use of confidential commit
tees for RFPs is standard practice.
In February 2009, such a committee
was responsible for finding the
Forbes Family Cafe's first tenant,
contacting 13 vendors before unani
mously awarding Shehadeh the con
tract from 2010 to 2013, with an op
tion to extend for another three
years afterwards.
In September 2012, when She
hadeh stepped back from manage
ment of the Stanford location, Stan
ford exercised a limited option to ex
tend the Ike's Place lease for one
more year, until June 2014.
This particular process is not
under scrutiny because of wrongdo

ing by any department certainly
not by R&DE, whose role in this
process is peripheral. It is under
scrutiny because of how the RFPs,
faithfully administered by adminis
trators and officials according to
University guidelines and in good
faith, could reach such universally
unpopular decisions.
Requests for a new proposal
In October 2013, just as Ike's
was beginning its last academic year
of operations in Huang, the Stan
ford Purchasing and Contracts of
fice opened the Forbes Family Cafe
case for bidding. The next month,

Akin, the point person for the con
tract, disseminated a food services
survey that would be used as part of
the RFP Committee's evaluation
criteria. The Committee then chose
16 local businesses to invite for a
tour of the Forbes Family Cafe.
On Dec. 17, 2013, representa
tives from the invited vendors at
tended a "bid walk" at the Huang
Engineering Center. Several ven
dors, including big-name chains like
Chipotle and Pizza My Heart, were
unable to seriously consider a bid
because of the Forbes Family Cafe's
