Following the announcement of
Bill and Melinda Gates as Com
mencement speakers for the up
coming Class of 2014 graduation this
year, students began forming a
movement requesting the Gates
Foundation to divest from company
G4S. As of yesterday, 1,100 people
had signed a petition calling for di
vestment due to a "litany of human
rights abuse and concerns" that the
statement claimed G4S was complic

On Wednesday, a stock exchange
filing showed that Gates had sold
down his stake in G4S to below three

stated. "We view Gates' decision as a
victory for our campaign and the
many others around the globe that
have been working tirelessly
against G4S' human rights abuses
and the Gates Foundation's invest
ments in them."
According to Clayton Evans 'l5,
another student organizer, there are
about 40 active members in the
coalition, which officially began its

push for student mobilization of the
campus about a month ago. The stu
dent coalition also includes repre
sentatives from a wide array of stu
dent groups including Fossil Free
Stanford, the Student Labor Al
liance, the Stanford Asian American
Activism Committee, Stanford
STAND and Students for Justice in
Palestine.
"[G4S] is involved in a huge
plethora and wide array of human
rights abuses in almost every
geopolitical and social context in
Central America, the Middle East
and South Africa," said Joshua
Schott 'l4, student organizer. "In
having the Gates Foundation in
vested in a corporation that does all
these things that kills and marginal
izes the communities that the Gates
Foundation tries to help is some-
