Following the announcement of
Bill and Melinda Gates as Com
mencement speakers for the up
coming Class of 2014 graduation this
year, students began forming a
movement requesting the Gates
Foundation to divest from company
G4S. As of yesterday, 1,100 people
had signed a petition calling for di
vestment due to a "litany of human
rights abuse and concerns" that the
statement claimed G4S was complic
it in.
On Wednesday, a stock exchange
filing showed that Gates had sold
down his stake in G4S to below three
percent. It is unclear exactly how
much stock Gates still holds because

three percent is the lowest thresh
old at which investors must declar.
The student group organizing
the protest released a statement ap
plauding Gates' decision to sell down
his shares.
"We have been in direct commu
nication with representatives of the
Foundation and indirect contact
with representatives of the Asset
Trust that runs the foundation's en
dowment since May 13 and as re
cently as May 28," the press release
stated. "We view Gates' decision as a
victory for our campaign and the
many others around the globe that
have been working tirelessly
against G4S' human rights abuses
and the Gates Foundation's invest
ments in them."
According to Clayton Evans 'l5,
another student organizer, there are
about 40 active members in the
coalition, which officially began its

push for student mobilization of the
campus about a month ago. The stu
dent coalition also includes repre
sentatives from a wide array of stu
dent groups including Fossil Free
Stanford, the Student Labor Al
liance, the Stanford Asian American
Activism Committee, Stanford
STAND and Students for Justice in
Palestine.
"[G4S] is involved in a huge
plethora and wide array of human
rights abuses in almost every
geopolitical and social context in
Central America, the Middle East
and South Africa," said Joshua
Schott 'l4, student organizer. "In
having the Gates Foundation in
vested in a corporation that does all
these things that kills and marginal
izes the communities that the Gates
Foundation tries to help is some-

what hypocritical and contra
dictory to what they're doing."
"It's not about being
against the Gates, it's about
trying to make the Gates
Foundation hold true to its
principle because it does so
much good and is an amazing
entity," Evans said.
In its press release following
the divestment, the Stanford
campaign said that it would con
tinue to call for broader action
than selling shares from G4S.
The group said that it is still ask
ing for the Gates Foundation

and its Asset Trust to complete
divest from G4S, reevaluate its
investments in companies under
investigation for human rights
abuses and to publicize its policy
of socially responsible invests
ment.
"Having the Gates Founda
tion [completely] divest from
[G4S] is the ultimate goal but
we're realistic and know that
there's a slim chance from
doing that, but we want a pub
lic engagement around these
issues," Schott said. "And so
this would be really crucial,
and I think we've aheady suc
ceeded a lot of ways in spark
ing discussion on campus."
