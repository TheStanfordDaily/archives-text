# STUDENT LIFE
## Trouble in Paradise: The state of mental health at Stanford 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
Originally published on March 7, 201b-
This article discusses mental health, depres
sion and suicide and may be triggering to
some people.
23 percent. That's how many Stanford students
say they have considered attempting suicide.
Three percent say they have followed through and
actually attempted it.
These are unscientific numbers, for sure. They
are drawn from a voluntary, non-exclusive, online
survey conducted by The Daily. But over 500 peo
ple responded, and so if these numbers are even
close to accurate, they paint a picture of the strug
gles simmering under the surface of life on the
Farm.
This is not a "Stanford-has-a-mental-health
problem" article. The reality is that depression and
suicide affect everyone, particularly young adults
a recent American College Health Assessment
survey found that nationwide, approximately 21
percent of college students have seriously consid
ered suicide, very similar to what The Daily found

at Stanford. At Penn, at least two students have
committed suicide since winter break. At Yale, a
student recently wrote a harrowing account of her
struggles with mental illness.
What this is, is a "Stanford-doesn't-woi-have-a
mental-health-problem" article. Time and time
again, online and in-person, students have ex
pressed the outside perspective that because of the
physical beauty of Stanford's campus and accom
plished nature of the people on it, Stanford stu
dents couldn't possibly have mental health strug
gles.
"We at Stanford live in such a paradise-seeming
place that we begin to believe that it is indeed a par
adise, that Stanford's (and by extension, students')
baseline should indeed be perfect," wrote a current
junior in response to the survey.
"There's a culture of 'we're the best and every
one is SOOO happy,' which can be toxic and alienat
ing to someone who doesn't feel that way," wrote a
current senior.
It should be stated outright: Stanford students
do struggle with mental health. They do struggle
with depression. They do consider and attempt sui
cide. And they often don't know where to turn.

Caitlin 'l6, whose name has been
changed to protect her privacy, was
hospitalized twice last year for her
struggles with anorexia, bulimia
and depression.
The first hospitalization dur
ing the first week of school was
by choice. Needing additional help
and not knowing where else to go,
Caitlin checked herself into Stan
ford Hospital, where she stayed for
three days.
However, the second hospitaliza
tion was not voluntary. After a peri
od of self-harm and a missed meet
ing with her psychiatrist, Caitlin
said that she was taken in a police
car from Vaden Health Center to
Stanford Hospital's involuntary
psychiatry ward for a five-day stay,
something she cited as one of the
most traumatic experiences she'd
ever lived though.
"I tried to explain, but eventual
ly I was informed that I was going to
the involuntary unit," she said. "I
don't know how to put this without
making it seem overly dramatic, but
they basically kind of told me that if
I was nice, the police wouldn't hand
cuff me."

Caitlin said that her peer health
educator (PHE) and the residence
dean (RD) were supportive during
her initial hospitalization. After she
was released from the hospital, the
University assigned a team of men
tal health professionals and Univer
sity officials to support her. While
Caitlin appreciated the support, she
said the burden of constant check
ins with her psychologist, psychia
trist, nutritionist and residence
dean added additional stress to her
recovery process.

"It was good of them, but at the
same time it just made me more
stressed out because I felt like I had
to convince everybody that I was on
top of things and meet with like four
people every week," Caitlin said.
"Every time they'd be looking at me
like 'Are things okay [Caitlin], are
you okay?' and I just wanted to cry,
but I just had to be like 'l'm happy,
I'm happier than I've ever been in
my life' and so on because there was
so much pressure on me."

One current Stern resident as
sistant (RA) said he was surprised
by the amount of mental health is
sues within his dorm. He said that
during his freshman year, he
thought that most of his peers were
having a uniformly happy experi
ence.

"Now as an RA, we're in a posi
tion where people do come to us for
help and do let us know about their
concerns, and so you see all that's
going on under the surface," the RA
said. "There's a lot. I think it's a
pretty fair statement to say that
most freshmen are dealing with
some kind of emotional or mental
struggle."
All RAs interviewed were grant
ed anonymity to protect the privacy
of their residents.

"Based on my experience, I
wouldn't be shocked if it was at least

one person in every freshman dorm
that has thought about [suicide],"
said another current Stern RA.

Indeed, three of five freshman
dorm staff members interviewed by
The Daily said a resident had ex
pressed suicidal thoughts to them
already this year. They also listed a
litany of additional struggles faced
by freshmen: eating disorders,
homesickness, academic chal
lenges, roommate conflicts, depres
sion and family issues at home.
Mental illness is a big focus of
staff training, during which future
staffers learn about, discuss and
role-play potential scenarios they
may face in dorms.
"When they tell you about these
things in training, they make it
seem like it's an option you may
deal with some of these things," said
a second Stern RA. "It's not an op
tion. You will be dealing with every
thing."

RAs are also given training in
the Question, Persuade, Refer
(QPR) suicide prevention tech
niques. QPR training was intro
duced at Stanford in 2008 as one of
the recommendations of the Stu
dent Mental Health and Well-Being
Task Force Report.
Alejandro Martinez, senior asso
ciate director of Counseling and
Psychological Services (CAPS),
said that QPR was implemented to
help the Stanford community better
respond to student crises. QPR re
lies on asking people direct ques
tions about how they are feeling and
what they are dealing with at that
moment in time, including asking
whether they are considering sui
cide.
"Sometimes we can see some
one's distress, but we have so much
respect for people's privacy, or we
think it's not our business and we
don't want to intrude in someone's
lives, so we hold back," Martinez ex
plained. "So a program like [QPR]
shows us that it's probably a good
idea to sometimes cross that line
and be a little more intrusive, but
potentially life-saving, to another
person."
"Most of the time when you ask
people directly about suicide, they
are going to say no," Martinez con
tinued. "That's typical it's not
like every time you ask you're going
to get an affirmative answer. But
you have already raised the ques
tion and sometimes people will say
'yes, I have been,' and that's the
time to pursue additional support
for that person."
Several RAs said that learning
when to seek outside help is empha
sized heavily in training.
"I think that maybe there are
some people who come in and think
that by dealing with a mental health

issue, you are trying to treat it
that's not the case," said a current
Wilbur RA. "Even though you as an
RA want to completely serve and
help your residents, there also
comes a point when you are only
trained so much."
For Stanford students, the next
step is often the hospital, CAPS or
the RD, depending on the severity
or immediacy of the case.

According to John Giammalva,
the residence dean for Wilbur Hall
and the Cowell Cluster, it is not un
common for each of the seven resi
dence deans to have at least one of
their students in the psychiatric
ward of the hospital.

Giammalva said that the most
immediate concern is always the
student's safety. Later, the resi
dence dean will work with CAPS,
the student and the student's family
to determine what and where treat
ment would be most effective.
Sometimes, that involves leaving
campus, which Giammalva charac
terized as a difficult decision.
"No student ever wants to leave
I don't think I've ever come
across a student that really wanted
to take time off," Giammalva said.
"But on the other hand, I think that
pretty much almost every single
student I've worked with, after
they've taken time off, has come
back and said, 'yeah, I needed
that.'"

Caitlin said she understood
Stanford's policy, although she
thought that sometimes it was over
enforced.
"It's well reasoned. You don't re
ally want someone who is suffering
from a mental illness to go to your
school because they're not going to
be able to perform at their prime,"
she explained. "That's not good for
the school or for the student, so it
was good of them."
Caitlin ultimately decided to
take a voluntary leave of absence
during spring quarter in order to
receive more treatment, and plans
to return next fall. Contrary to the
reported experiences at other uni
versities, however, she said she is
"really grateful" for the support
Stanford offered her, particularly
now that she is in recovery.
"I feel that Stanford is a very
much more compassionate commu
nity than many other colleges," she
said. "In my dealings with the whole
administration related to mental
health and leaving Stanford, to me,
it seems as if they cared more about
my individual case then they would
at say, Harvard and Yale."

Despite the prevalence of men
tal health issues on campus, stu
dents reported difficulty stimulat

ing conversation surrounding the
topic. Caitlin said that at the time of
her hospitalization, she didn't know
of any other students who were
going through the same experience.
Hannah 'l4, who has been diag
nosed with depression, said that
people often don't understand how
mental health can affect students.

"Sometimes, I can't make myself
get up and go to class that is not
me being lazy, that is me having a
medical issue, and that sounds
dumb to people," Hannah said.
"[People] laugh at how much I pro
crastinate or 'oh, you didn't go to
class'... they know [about my de
pression], but they don't make the
connection."

Hannah, who asked to be identi
fied only by her first name, said that
even though students are usually
aware of mental health issues, they
don't create safe spaces to discuss
them and are occasionally insensi
tive. She shared a recent experience
of a classmate attempting to explain
the complexities of steel maven An
drew Carnegie by saying that "he
was completely crazy, like he should
have been on pills or something."

"As someone who is on medica
tion for mental health issues, the
idea of being equated with someone
who was a racist, classist, old white
man from the 1800s, the idea that
that is the perception of people who
need help for mental health issues is
really troubling to me," Hannah
said.

Many students echoed the idea
that the topic of mental health could
benefit from increased discussion,
either through receiving more em
phasis during New Student Orien
tation and awareness weeks or
through regular programming
where people could share their ex
periences and thoughts.
"It's the kind of thing where you
just want to have conversations
about it," one Stern RA said. "I
think there's this stigma and people
don't talk about it. [You hear], 'oh,
someone went to CAPS,' and all of a
sudden you think the person is
going through a mental crisis, but in

reality, some people just need to go
to CAPS to talk. I think that's a
huge thing that we can do at Stan
ford is break down that stigma."
The current Wilbur RA said that
she thinks the way Stanford stu
dents handle stress is unhealthy.
"It's kind of celebrated and seen
as a badge of honor how
stressed you are, how little sleep
you've had, how much coffee you've
been drinking, how many units
you're taking," she said. "Very sel
dom do you see people say, 'l'm in 14
units and I slept 10 hours and I'm
loving it.'"
"That isn't celebrated and I
think we need to shift that culture a
little bit and just recognize that
stress is normal in the sense that it
will happen, but chronic stress is
not something that should be con
sidered normal," she added.

In recent years, Stanford, as
well as other universities, has ex
panded the support it offers stu
dents.
"Historically, if you had a psychi
atric condition that impacted your
ability to be at Stanford, it was kind
of too bad for you people were
sad and concerned but that was ba
sically it," Martinez said. "[Now],
there is not only an interest but a
legal requirement that we make rea
sonable accommodations to people,
so it's more possible to be successful
at Stanford even if you get chal
lenged by a psychiatric condition."
Martinez pointed to several ini
tiatives that have been introduced
at Stanford in recent years, such as
the so-called "Happiness class," or
CAPS' new StressLess@Stanford
program, as well as improvements
like hiring more staffers at CAPS
and refining RA training.
"Stanford has a very strong
commitment to move forward in
this direction," Martinez said. "It
has committed significant re
sources in the last, I would say six
years, to make sure that we are in a
better position to respond to this in
creased overall commitment to pay
attention to our well-being."
The Wilbur RA said that it would
be helpful if mental health were
thought of in a positive, proactive
way instead of being treated solely
as a disease.
"[You can] ask students to reflect
on their own mental health, just like
daily check-ins ... whether it be
through jour naling or through med
itation or being outside," she said. "I
wish that Stanford did a better job
of supporting students and figuring
out what are those healthy habits
that I want to institute now that can
last forever."
Another Stern RA said that
while Stanford has a lot to offer, the
beautiful campus, brilliant admit
tees and award-winning professors
shouldn't be used to gloss over the
struggles that students face.
"There is a case to be made for
Stanford to highlight that students
go through bad stuff, to make other
students know it's okay," the RA
said. "It would be nice if Stanford
made more of an effort to highlight
the fact that it's not as pristine as
they want it to be seen."
