## Trouble in Paradise: The state of mental health at Stanford

This article discusses mental health, depres
sion and suicide and may be triggering to
some people.
23 percent. That's how many Stanford students
say they have considered attempting suicide.
Three percent say they have followed through and
actually attempted it.
These are unscientific numbers, for sure. They
are drawn from a voluntary, non-exclusive, online
survey conducted by The Daily. But over 500 peo
ple responded, and so if these numbers are even
close to accurate, they paint a picture of the strug
gles simmering under the surface of life on the
Farm.
This is not a "Stanford-has-a-mental-health
problem" article. The reality is that depression and
suicide affect everyone, particularly young adults
a recent American College Health Assessment
survey found that nationwide, approximately 21
percent of college students have seriously consid
ered suicide, very similar to what The Daily found

at Stanford. At Penn, at least two students have
committed suicide since winter break. At Yale, a
student recently wrote a harrowing account of her
struggles with mental illness.
What this is, is a "Stanford-doesn't-woi-have-a
mental-health-problem" article. Time and time
again, online and in-person, students have ex
pressed the outside perspective that because of the
physical beauty of Stanford's campus and accom
plished nature of the people on it, Stanford stu
dents couldn't possibly have mental health strug
gles.
"We at Stanford live in such a paradise-seeming
place that we begin to believe that it is indeed a par
adise, that Stanford's (and by extension, students')
baseline should indeed be perfect," wrote a current
junior in response to the survey.
"There's a culture of 'we're the best and every
one is SOOO happy,' which can be toxic and alienat
ing to someone who doesn't feel that way," wrote a
current senior.
It should be stated outright: Stanford students
do struggle with mental health. They do struggle
with depression. They do consider and attempt sui
cide. And they often don't know where to turn.
