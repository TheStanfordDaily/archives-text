## University to offer new joint major FacSen approves new majors combining CS and music, CS and English 
### CATHERINE ZAW MANAGING EDITOR 
Originally published on April 3, 2014.
Starting next fall quarter, Stanford will offer un
dergraduates the opportunity to pursue a joint
major in computer science (CS) and another hu
manities major, following the initiative's approval
by the Faculty Senate in February.
The initiative's pilot offerings will combine com
puter science with either English or music, though
a more diverse selection may be featured in the fu
ture.
The new program's structure will be distinct
from both double majors and dual degrees. Stu
dents who choose to pursue the joint major will not
be expected to complete the full requirements of ei
ther of the two majors, but will instead conclude
their educational experience with "capstone" inter
disciplinary courses or projects.

According to Nicholas Jenkins, associate pro
fessor of English and director of the CS+X initia
tiveâ€” which eventually developed into the joint
major program many humanities departments
are interested in participating in the joint major
program.
"CS is becoming an integral part of many hu
manities majors, and the humanities are becoming
important in CS," Jenkins said. "There's a lot of
two way traffic and we hope that all these bridges
will help transform not only the humanities, but
also the computer sciences. We're hoping that
starting in September this year, there will be a
whole raft of CS and humanities joint majors."
Jenkins credited the push for the joint major
program to Professor of Computer Science Eric
Roberts, who advanced the idea of bringing togeth
er two disciplines in a fashion that wasn't too aca
demically rigorous to students.
"It's a wonderful thing to integrate two fields of
knowledge and find in that interstitial between two
fields a really wonderful new set of ideas and that's
exciting," Roberts said. "Most real progress comes
at the intersection."
Roberts recalled encountering signifi
cant faculty interest last spring when he
first proposed the idea. A Computer Science
Department survey of all CS majors and
students who had taken the introductory
CSIO6A class during the 2012-13 academic
year, according to Professor of Computer
Science Mehran Sahami '92 M.S. '93 Ph.D.
'99, found that 63 percent of students would
be more likely to double major were Stan
ford to offer a program that reduced the
number of classes required for each major
by two courses.
Roberts subsequently reached out to hu
manities departments, with the intent of en
couraging students who were originally inter
ested in the humanities but who for vari
ous reasons ended up majoring in CS for
"marketability" or "practicality" reasons
to pursue then- passions and increasing acces
sibility to larger majors like economics which
might have been too demanding otherwise.
Faculty members conceded that the pro
gram's implementation might strain the
Computer Science Department's resources.
"Making sure that the students get good
advising is going to be a challenge," said de
partment chair Jennifer Widom. "Making
sure that we don't grow so fast that we get
overwhelmed is something to worry about."
Widom explained that the current number
of undergraduates in CS has tripled from a
few years ago. Although students' academic
interests have largely remained the same
over time when matriculating, a progressive
ly larger number of students have switched to

computer science over the course of their un
dergraduate career.
"[The joint major program] is one way we
can address students that have CS and anoth
er passion," Widom said.
Widom disputed, however, the concept
that the development of a joint major pro
gram linking computer science with various
humanities subjects means that the humani
ties are dying out.
"We're not too worried about that,"
Widom said. "We realize that computing and
data is becoming more and more important,
and it's being validated on the undergraduate
level."
In fact, many faculty members, including
Widom, argued that the joint major program
might help decrease the apparent "fuzzy
techie" divide that exists at Stanford.
"We're all at one university together. I
don't know how real [the fuzzy-techie divide]
is, but here's something holistic that would be
a real benefit for the students," Jenkins said.
"I think that's important for the general mood
of the University, for people not to feel forced
to feel like they have to be on one side of the
fence or the other."
Jenkins also asserted that the joint
major program will be important for the
broader University, especially in terms of
developing a new kind of intellectual cul
ture.
"I believe that this is a positive way to
reconceptualize what the humanities can do
and also for other disciplines," Jenkins said.
"People watch Stanford and they look at
what we're doing, so I think in my opinion,
we should be the ones doing the experiment
ing bringing CS and the humanities to
gether to the next level."
