Starting next fall quarter, Stanford will offer un

manities majors, and the humanities are becoming
important in CS," Jenkins said. "There's a lot of
two way traffic and we hope that all these bridges
will help transform not only the humanities, but
also the computer sciences. We're hoping that
starting in September this year, there will be a
whole raft of CS and humanities joint majors."
Jenkins credited the push for the joint major
program to Professor of Computer Science Eric
Roberts, who advanced the idea of bringing togeth
er two disciplines in a fashion that wasn't too aca
demically rigorous to students.
"It's a wonderful thing to integrate two fields of
knowledge and find in that interstitial between two
fields a really wonderful new set of ideas and that's
exciting," Roberts said. "Most real progress comes
